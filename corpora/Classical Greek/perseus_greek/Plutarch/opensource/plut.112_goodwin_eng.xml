                  <p>Some, my dear Sossius Senecio, imagine that this sentence, <foreign lang="greek">mse/w mna/mona sumpo/tan</foreign>, was principally designed against
						the stewards of a feast, who are usually troublesome and
						press liquor too much upon the guests. For the Dorians
						in Sicily (as I am informed) called the steward <foreign lang="greek">mna/mona</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">a
							remembrancer.</hi> Others think that this proverb admonisheth the guests to forget every thing that is spoken or
						done in company; and agreeably to this, the ancients used
						to consecrate forgetfulness with a ferula to Bacchus, thereby
						intimating that we should either not remember any irregularity committed in mirth and company, or apply a gentle
						and childish correction to the faults. But because you are
						of opinion that to forget absurdities is indeed (as Euripides
						says) a piece of wisdom, but to deliver over to oblivion all
						sort of discourse that merry meetings do usually produce
						is not only repugnant to that endearing quality that most
						allow to an entertainment, but against the known practice
						of the greatest philosophers (for Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, Speusippus, Epicurus, Prytanis, Hieronymus, Dion
						the Academic, have thought it a worthy and noble employment to deliver down to us those discourses they had at
						table), and since it is your pleasure that I should gather
						up the chiefest of those scattered topics which both at
						Rome and Greece amidst our cups and feasting we have
						disputed on, in obedience to your commands I have sent

               <head>Question I.
						<lb/> WHETHER MIDST OUR CUPS IT IS FIT TO TALK LEARNEDLY AND PHILOSOPHIZE?
						<lb/> SOSSIUS SENECIO, ARISTO, PLUTARCH, CRATO, AND OTHERS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THE first question is, Whether at table it is allowable
						to philosophize? For I remember at a supper at Athens
						this doubt was started, whether at a merry meeting it was
						fit to use philosophical discourse, and how far it might be
						used? And Aristo presently cried out: What then, for
						heaven's sake, are there any that banish philosophy from
						company and wine? And I replied: Yes, sir, there are,
						and such as with a grave scoff tell us that philosophy, like
						the matron of the house, should never be heard at a merry
						entertainment; and commend the custom of the Persians,
						who never let their wives appear, but drink, dance, and
						wanton with their whores. This they propose for us to
						imitate; they permit us to have mimics and music at our
						feasts, but forbid philosophy; she, forsooth, being very unfit
						to be wanton with us, and we in a bad condition to be
						serious. Isocrates the rhetorician, when at a drinking
						bout some begged him to make a speech, only returned:
						With those things in which I have skill the time doth not
						suit; and in those things with which the time suits I have
						no skill.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>And Crato cried out: By Bacchus, he was right in
						forswearing talk, if he designed to make such long-winded
						discourses as would have spoiled all mirth and conversation; but I do not think there is the same reason to forbid
						philosophy as to take away rhetoric from our feasts. For
						philosophy is quite of another nature; it is an art of living,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.199"/>
						
						and therefore must be admitted into every part of our conversation, into all our gay humors and our pleasures, to
						regulate and adjust them, to proportion the time, and keep
						them from excess; unless, perchance, upon the same scoffing pretence of gravity, they would banish temperance,
						justice, and moderation. It is true, were we to feast in a
						court-room, as those that entertained Orestes, and were
						silence enjoined by law, that might prove a not unlucky
						cloak of our ignorance; but if Bacchus is really <foreign lang="greek">lu/sios</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">a
							looser</hi> of every thing), and chiefly takes off all restraints and
						bridles from the tongue, and gives the voice the greatest
						freedom, I think it is foolish and absurd to deprive that
						time in which we are usually most talkative of the most
						useful and profitable discourse; and in our schools to
						dispute of the offices of company, in what consists the
						excellence of a guest, how mirth, feasting, and wine are to
						be used, and yet deny philosophy a place in these feasts,
						as if not able to confirm by practice what by precepts it
						instructs.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>And when you affirmed that none ought to oppose
						what Crato said, but determine what sorts of philosophical
						topics were to be admitted as fit companions at a feast, and
						so avoid that just and pleasant taunt put upon the wrangling disputers of the age,
						<quote rend="blockquote">Come now to supper, that we may contend;</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>and when you seemed concerned and urged us to
							speak to that head, I first replied: Sir, we must consider
							what company we have; for if the greater part of the
							guests are learned men,&mdash;as for instance, at Agatho's
							entertainment, men like Socrates, Phaedrus, Pausanias,
							Euryximachus; or at Callias's board, Charmides, Antisthenes, Hermogenes, and the like,&mdash;we will permit them to
							philosophize, and to mix Bacchus with the Muses as well
							as with the Nymphs; for the latter make him wholesome
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.200"/>
							
							and gentle to the body, and the other pleasant and agreeable to the soul. And if there are some few illiterate persons present, they, as mute consonants with vowels, in the
							midst of the other learned, will participate in a voice not
							altogether inarticulate and insignificant. But if the greater
							part consists of such who can better endure the noise of
							any bird, fiddle-string, or piece of wood than the voice of
							a philosopher, Pisistratus hath shown us what to do; for
							being at difference with his sons, when he heard his enemies rejoiced at it, in a full assembly he declared that he
							had endeavored to persuade his sons to submit to him, but
							since he found them obstinate, he was resolved to yield and
							submit to their humors. So a philosopher, midst those companions that slight his excellent discourse, will lay aside his
							gravity, follow them, and comply with their humor as far
							as decency will permit; knowing very well that men cannot exercise their rhetoric unless they speak, but may their
							philosophy even whilst they are silent or jest merrily, nay,
							whilst they are piqued upon or repartee. For it is not only
							(as Plato says) the highest degree of injustice not to be just
							and yet seem so; but it is the top of wisdom to philosophize, yet not appear to do it; and in mirth to do the same
							with those that are serious, and yet seem in earnest. For
							as in Euripides, the Bacchae, though unprovided of iron
							weapons and unarmed, wounded their invaders with their
							boughs, thus the very jests and merry talk of true philosophers move and correct in some sort those that are not
							altogether insensible.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>I think there are topics fit to be used at table, some

						and noble actions, others to make us rivals of the bountiful and kind; which if a man cunningly and without

						 evils which usually attend them. Some that put

						Homer's Helen, who with some medicament diluted the

						 and (to use Democritus's word) wrangling disputes,
						which perplex the proposers with intricate and inexplicable doubts, and trouble all the others that are present.
						Our discourse should be like our wine, common to all, and
						of which every one may equally partake; and they that
						propose hard problems seem no better fitted for society
						than Aesop's fox and crane. For the fox vexed the crane
						with thin broth poured out upon a flat stone, and laughed
						at her when he saw her, by reason of the narrowness of
						her bill and the thinness of the broth, incapable of partaking what he had prepared; and the crane, in requital,
						inviting the fox to supper, brought forth her dainties in a
						pot with a long and narrow neck, which she could conveniently thrust her bill into, whilst the fox could not reach
						one bit. Just so, when philosophers midst their cups dive
						into minute and logical disputes, they are very troublesome
						to those that cannot follow them through the same depths;
						and those that bring in idle songs, trifling disquisitions,
						common talk, and mechanical discourse destroy the very
						end of conversation and merry entertainments, and abuse
						Bacchus. Therefore, as when Phrynichus and Aeschylus
						brought tragedy to discourse of fables and misfortunes, it
						was asked, What is this to Bacchus?&mdash;so methinks, when
						I hear some pedantically drawing a syllogism into table-talk, I have reason to cry out, Sir, what is this to Bacchus?
						Perchance one, the great bowl standing in the midst, and
						the chaplets given round, which the God in token of the
						liberty he bestows sets on every head, sings one of those
						songs called <foreign lang="greek">skolia/</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">crooked</hi> or <hi rend="italics">obscure</hi>); this is not fit nor
						agreeable to a feast. Though some say these <foreign lang="greek">skolia/</foreign> were
						not dark and intricate composures; but that the guests
						sang the first song all together, praising Bacchus and describing the power of the God; and the second each man
						sang singly in his turn, a myrtle bough being delivered to
						every one in order, which they call an <foreign lang="greek">ai)/sakon</foreign> because he
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.203"/>
						
						that received it was obliged to sing (<foreign lang="greek">a)/|dein</foreign>); and after this
						a harp being carried round the company, the skilful took
						it, and fitted the music to the song; this when the unskilful could not perform, the song was called <foreign lang="greek">skolio/n</foreign>, because
						it was hard to them, and one in which they could not bear
						a part. Others say this myrtle bough was not delivered
						in order, but from bed to bed; and when the uppermost
						of the first table had sung, he sent it to the uppermost of
						the second, and he to the uppermost of the third; and so
						the second in like manner to the second; and from these

                  <p>MY brother Timon, making a great entertainment,
						desired the guests as they came to seat themselves; for he

						dressed as fine as hands could make him, his clothes rich,

						up to the parlor-door, and, staring round upon those that
						were already seated, turned his back and scornfully retired; and when a great many stepped after him and

                  <p>And story says that Paulus Aemilius, after he had conquered Perseus the king of Macedon, making an entertainment, besides his costly furniture and extraordinary
							provision, was very critical in the order of his feast; saying, It is the same man's task to order a terrible battle and
							a pleasing entertainment, for both of them require skill
							in the art of disposing right. Homer often calls the
							stoutest and the greatest princes <foreign lang="greek">kosmh/toras law=n</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">disposers</hi>
							              <hi rend="italics">of the people;</hi> and you use to say that the great Creator,

							own observation sufficiently assures us, that the greatest
							profuseness in a feast appears neither delightful nor genteel, unless beautified by order. And therefore it is
							absurd that cooks and waiters should be solicitous what

							place and order assigned, and yet that the guests should be
							seated promiscuously, and no respect be had to age, honor,
							or the like; no distinguishing order by which the man in
							dignity might be honored, the inferior learn to give place,
							and the disposer be exercised in distinguishing what is proper and convenient. For it is not rational that, when we
							walk or sit down to discourse, the best man should have
							the best place, and that the same order should not be

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>And my brother said: I am not so much wiser than
						Bias, that, since he refused to be arbitrator between two
						only of his friends, I should pretend to be a judge between
						so many strangers and acquaintance; especially since it is
						not a money matter, but about precedence and dignity, as
						if I invited my friends not to treat them kindly, but to
						abuse them. Menelaus is accounted absurd and passed into
						a proverb, for pretending to advise when unasked; and
						sure he would be more ridiculous that instead of an entertainer should set up for a judge, when nobody requests
						him or submits to his determination which is the best and
						which the worst man in the company; for the guests do
						not come to contend about precedency, but to feast and be
						merry. Besides, it is no easy task for him to distinguish;
						for some claim respect by reason of their age, others from
						their familiarity and acquaintance; and, like those that
						make declamations consisting of comparisons, he must
						have Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">to/poi</foreign> and Thrasymachus's <foreign lang="greek">u(perba/llontes</foreign> (books
						that furnish him with heads of argument) at his fingers'
						end; and all this to no good purpose or profitable effect,
						but to bring vanity from the bar and the theatre into our
						feasts and entertainments, and, whilst by good fellowship
						we endeavor to remit all other passions, to intend pride
						and arrogance, from which, in my opinion, we should be
						more careful to cleanse our souls than to wash our feet
						from dirt, that our conversation may be free, simple, and
						fill of mirth. And while by such meetings we strive to
						end all differences that have at any time risen amongst the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.206"/>
						
						invited, we should make them flame anew, and kindle
						them again by emulation, by thus debasing some and
						puffing up others. And if, according as we seat them, we
						should drink oftener and discourse more with some than
						others, and set daintier dishes before them, instead of being
						friendly we should be lordly in our feasts. And if in
						other things we treat them all equally, why should we not
						begin at the first part, and bring it into fashion for all to take
						their seats promiscuously, without ceremony or pride, and
						to let them see, as soon as they enter, that they are invited
						to a dinner whose order is free and democratical, and not
						as particular chosen men to the government of a city
						where aristocracy is the form; since the richest and the
						poorest sit promiscuously together.</p>

                  <p>When this had been offered on both sides, and all

						neither side, but go indifferently in the middle between
						both. If a man invites young men, citizens, or acquaintance, they should (as Timon says) be accustomed to be
						content with any place, without ceremony or concernment;
						and this good-nature and unconcernedness would be an
						excellent means to preserve and increase friendship. But
						if we use the same method to strangers, magistrates, or old
						men, I have just reason to fear that, whilst we seem to
						thrust our pride at the fore-door, we bring it in again at
						the back, together with a great deal of indifferency and
						disrespect. But in this, custom and the established rules
						of decency must guide; or else let us abolish all those
						modes of respect expressed by drinking to or saluting
						first; which we do not use promiscuously to all the

							to virtue, kindred, magistracies, and such other qualities;
							and whilst he endeavors not to affront his guests, he necessarily falls into that very inconvenience; for he must
							affront every one by defrauding them of their proper
							honor. Besides, in my opinion it is no hard matter to
							make this distinction, and seat our guests according to
							their quality; for first, it very seldom happens that many
							of equal honor are invited to the same banquet; and then,
							since there are many honorable places, you have room
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.208"/>
							
							enough to dispose them according to content, if you can

							acquaintance, tutor, or the like, appointing every one some
							place of honor; and as for the rest, I would supply their
							want of honor with some little presents, affability, and
							kind discourse. But if their qualities are not easy to be
							distinguished, and the men themselves hard to be pleased,
							see what device I have in that case; for I seat in the most
							honorable place my father, if invited; if not, my grandfather, father-in-law, uncle, or somebody whom the entertainer hath a more particular reason to esteem. And this
							is one of the many rules of decency that we have from
							Homer; for in his poem, when Achilles saw Menelaus and
							Antilochus contending about the second prize of the horserace, fearing that their strife and fury would increase, he
							gave the prize to another, under pretence of comforting
							and honoring Eumelus, but indeed to take away the cause
							of their contention.</p>

               <head>Question III. 
						<lb/> UPON WHAT ACCOUNT IS THE PLACE AT THE TABLE CALLED CONSULAR ESTEEMED HONORABLE.
						<lb/> THE SAME.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THIS raised a dispute about the dignity of places, for the
							same place is not accounted honorable amongst all nations;
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.211"/>
							
							in Persia the midst, for that is the place proper to the king
							himself; in Greece the uppermost; at Rome the lowermost of the middle bed, and this is called the consular;
							the Greeks about Pontus, as those of Heraclea, reckon the
							uppermost of the middle bed to be the chief. But we
							were most puzzled about the place called consular; for
							though it is esteemed most honorable, yet it is not for any
							well-defined reason, as if it were either the first or the
							midst; and its other circumstances are either not proper
							to that alone, or very frivolous. Though I confess three
							of the reasons alleged seemed to have something in them.
							The first was, that the consuls, having dissolved the monarchy, and reduced every thing to a more equal level and
							popular estate, left the middle, the kingly place, and sat in
							a lower seat; that by this means their power and authority
							might be less subject to envy, and not so grievous to their
							fellow-citizens. The second was, that, two beds being appointed for the invited guests, the third&mdash;and the first place
							in this&mdash;is most convenient for the master of the feast,
							whence, like a coachman or a pilot, he can guide and order
							every thing, and readily overlook the management of the
							whole affair. Besides, he is not so far removed but that
							he may easily discourse, talk to, and compliment his guests;
							for next below him his wife and children usually are placed;
							next above him the most honorable of the invited, that being
							the most proper place, as near the master of the feast. The
							third reason was, that it is peculiar to this place to be most
							convenient for the despatch of any sudden business; for the
							Roman consul is not such a one as Archias the governor
							of Thebes, so as to say, when letters of importance are
							brought to him at dinner, <q direct="unspecified">serious things to-morrow,</q>
							and then throw aside the packet and take the great

							any message, answer it, or sign a bill; for there the second

               <head>Question IV.
						<lb/> WHAT MANNER OF MAN SHOULD A STEWARD OF A FEAST BE?
						<lb/> CRATO, THEON, PLUTARCH, AND OTHERS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>CRATO a relative of ours, and Theon my acquaintance,
						at a certain banquet, where the glasses had gone round freely, and a little stir arose but was suddenly appeased, began
						to discourse of the office of the steward of a feast; declaring
						that it was my duty to wear the chaplet, assert the decaying
						privilege, and restore that office which should take care for
						the decency and good order of the banquet. This proposal
						pleased every one, and they were all an end begging me
						to do it. Well then, said I, since you will have it so, I
						make myself steward and director of you all, and command
						the rest of you to drink every one what he will, but Crato
						and Theon, the first proposers and authors of this decree,
						I enjoin to declare in short what qualifications fit a man
						for this office, what he should principally aim at, and how
						behave himself towards those under his command. This
						is the subject, and let them agree amongst themselves
						which head each shall manage.</p>
                  <pb id="v.3.p.213"/>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>They made some slight excuse at first; but the whole
						company urging them to obey, Crato began thus. A captain of a watch (as Plato says) ought to be most watchful
						and diligent himself, and the director of merry companions
						ought to be the best. And such a one he is, that will not
						be easily overtaken or apt to refuse a glass; but as Cyrus
						in his epistle to the Spartans says, that in many other
						things he was more fit than his brother to be a king, and
						chiefly because he could bear abundance of wine. For
						one that is drunk must have an ill carriage and be apt to
						affront; and he that is perfectly sober, must be unpleasant,
						and fitter to be a governor of a school than of a feast. Pericles, as often as he was chosen general, when he first put
						on his cloak, used to say to himself, as it were to refresh
						his memory, Take heed, Pericles, thou dost govern freemen, thou dost govern Greeks, thou dost govern Athenians.
						So let our director say privately to himself, Thou art a
						governor over friends, that he may remember to neither
						suffer them to be debauched nor stint their mirth. Besides,
						he ought to have some skill in the serious studies of the
						guests, and not be altogether ignorant of mirth and humor;
						yet I would have him (as pleasant wine ought to be) a
						little severe and rough, for the liquor will soften and smooth
						him, and make his temper pleasant and agreeable. For as
						Xenophon says, that Clearchus's rustic and morose humor
						in a battle, by reason of his bravery and heat, seemed pleasant and surprising; thus one that is not of a very sour nature, but grave and severe, being softened by a chirping cup,
						becomes more pleasant and complaisant. But chiefly he
						should be acquainted with every one of the guests' humors, what alteration the liquor makes in him, what passion he is most subject to, and what quantity he can bear;
						for it is not to be supposed the water bears various proportions to different sorts of wine (which kings' cup-bearers understanding sometimes pour in more, sometimes less),
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.214"/>
						
						and that man hath no such relation to them. This our director ought to know, and knowing, punctually observe;
						so that like a good musician, screwing up one and letting
						down another, he may make between these different natures
						a pleasing harmony and agreement; so that he shall not proportion his wine by measure, but give every one what was
						proper and agreeable, according to the present circumstances of time and strength of body. But if this is too
						difficult a task, yet it is necessary that a steward should
						know the common accidents of age and nature, such as
						these,&mdash;that an old man will be sooner overtaken than a
						youth, one that leaps about or talks sooner than he that
						is silent or sits still, the thoughtful and melancholy sooner
						than the cheerful and the brisk. And he that understands
						these things is much more able to preserve quietness and
						order, than one that is perfectly ignorant and unskilful.
						Besides, I think none will doubt but that the steward
						ought to be a friend, and have no pique at any of the
						guests; for otherwise in his injunctions he will be intolerable, in his distributions unequal, in his jests apt to scoff
						and give offence. Such a figure, Theon, as out of wax,
						hath my discourse framed for the steward of a feast; and
						now I deliver him to you.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>And Theon replied: He is welcome,&mdash;a very well-shaped gentleman, and fitted for the office; but whether I
						shall not spoil him in my particular application, I cannot
						tell. In my opinion he seems such a one as will keep an
						entertainment to its primitive institution, and not suffer it
						to be changed, sometimes into a mooting hall, sometimes
						a school of rhetoric, now and then a dicing-room, a playhouse, or a stage. For do not you observe some making
						fine orations and putting cases at a supper, others declaiming or reading some of their own compositions, and
						others proposing prizes to dancers and mimics? Alcibiades and Theodorus turned Polition's banquet into a place
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.215"/>
						
						of initiation, representing there the sacred procession and
						mysteries of Ceres; now such things as these, in my
						opinion, ought not to be suffered by a steward, but he
						must permit such discourse only, such shows, such merriment, as promote the particular end and design of such
						entertainments; and that is, by pleasant conversation
						either to beget or maintain friendship and good-will
						among the guests; for an entertainment is only a pleasant recreation at the table with a glass of wine, aiming
						to contract friendship through mutual good-will.</p>
                  <p>But now because things pure and unmixed are usually
							surfeiting and odious, and the very mixture itself, unless
							the simples be well proportioned and opportunely put together, spoils the sweetness and goodness of the composition; it is evident that there ought to be a director who
							shall take care that the mirth and jollity of the guests be
							exactly and opportunely tempered. It is a common saying, that a voyage near the land and a walk near the sea
							are the best recreation. Thus our steward should place
							seriousness and gravity next jollity and humor; that, when
							they are merry, they should be on the very borders of
							gravity itself, and when grave and serious, they might be
							refreshed as sea-sick persons, having an easy and short
							prospect to the mirth and jollity on the shore. For mirth
							may be exceeding useful, and make our grave discourses
							smooth and pleasant,&mdash;

						angry, which argues a hot constitution. And some report
						his sweat was fragrant and perfumed his clothes; which is
						another argument of heat, as we see the hottest and driest
						climates bear frankincense and cassia; for a flagrant smell,
						as Theophrastus thinks, proceeds from a due concoction of
						the humors, when the noxious moisture is conquered by
						the heat. And it is thought probable, that he took a pique

                  <p>Amongst the retainers to Drusus, the Emperor Tiberius's son, there was a physician that drank down all the

						six bitter almonds to prevent the operation of the wine;
						but whenever he was forbidden that, he knocked under
						presently, and a single glass dozed him. Some think these
						almonds have a penetrating, abstersive quality, are able to
						cleanse the face, and clear it from the common freckles;
						and therefore, when they are eaten, by their bitterness
						vellicate and fret the pores, and by that means draw down
						the ascending vapors from the head. But, in my opinion,

						a bitter quality is a drier, and consumes moisture; and

                  <p>And he guesses well, that what is bitter to the taste is a
							drier. Besides, the powders women use to dry up their

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>IT was debated why old men loved the strongest

							most necessary and agreeable to their age; but this was

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>To my discourse in the former problem some objection
						may be drawn from the sense of seeing in old men; for,
						if they hold a book at a distance, they will read pretty
						well, nearer they cannot see a letter. This Aeschylus
						means by these verses:
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <lg>
                           <l>Behold from far; for near thou canst not see;

                  </p>
                  <p>And Sophocles more plainly:
							
							<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <lg>
                           <l>Old men are slow in talk, they hardly hear;

                  <p>And therefore, if old men's organs are more obedient to

							not take the reflection near at hand, but, holding the book

               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Some answered, that they did not remove the book
						to lessen the light, but to receive more rays, and let all the
						space between the letters and their eyes be filled with
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.223"/>
						
						lightsome air. Others agreed with those that imagine the
						rays of vision mix with one another; for since there is a
						cone stretched between each eye and the object, whose point
						is in the eye and whose basis is the object, it is probable
						that for some way each cone extends apart and by itself;
						but, when the distance increases, they mix and make but
						one common light; and therefore every object appears
						single and not two, though it is seen by both eyes at once;
						for the conjunction of the cones makes these two appearances but one. These things supposed, when old men
						hold the letters near to their eyes, the cones not being
						joined, but each apart and by itself, their sight is weak;
						but when they remove it farther, the two lights being
						mingled and increased, they see better, as a man with
						both hands can hold that for which either singly is too
						weak.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>But my brother Lamprias, though unacquainted with
						Hieronymus's notions, gave us the same reason. We see,
						said he, some species that come from the object to the eye,
						which at their first rise are thick and great, and therefore
						when near disturb old men, whose eyes are stiff and not
						easily penetrated; but when they are separated and diffused into the air, the thick obstructing parts are easily
						removed, and the subtile remainders coming to the eye
						slide gently and easily into the pores; and so the disturbance being less, the sight is more vigorous and clear.
						Thus a rose smells most fragrant at a distance; but if you
						bring it near the nose, it is not so pure and delightful;
						and the reason is this,&mdash;many earthy disturbing particles
						are carried with the smell, and spoil the fragrancy when
						near, but in a longer passage those are lost, and the pure
						brisk odor, by reason of its subtility, reaches and acts upon
						the sense.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>But we, according to Plato's opinion, assert that a
						bright spirit darted from the eye mixes with the light
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.224"/>
						
						about the object, and those two are perfectly blended into
						one similar body; now these must be joined in due proportion one to another; for one part ought not wholly to
						prevail on the other, but both, being proportionally and
						amicably joined, should agree in one third common power.
						Now this (whether flux, illuminated spirit, or ray) in old
						men being very weak, there can be no combination, no
						mixture with the light about the object; but it must be
						wholly consumed, unless, by removing the letters from
						their eyes, they lessen the brightness of the light, so that
						it comes to the sight not too strong or unmixed, but well
						proportioned and blended with the other. And this explains that common affection of creatures seeing in the
						dark; for their eye-sight being weak is overcome and
						darkened by the splendor of the day; because the little
						light that flows from their eyes cannot be proportionably
						mixed with the stronger and more numerous beams; but
						it is proportionable and sufficient for the feeble splendor
						of the stars, and so can join with it, and co-operate to
						move the sense.

						<lb/> WHY FRESH WATER WASHES CLOTHES BETTER THAN SALT.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THEON the grammarian, when Metrius Florus gave
						us an entertainment, asked Themistocles the Stoic, why
						Chrysippus, though he frequently mentioned some strange
						phenomena in nature (as that salt fish soaked in salt
						water grows fresher than before, fleeces of wool are more
						easily separated by a gentle than a quick and violent force,
						and men that are fasting eat slower than those who took a
						breakfast), yet never gave any reason for the appearance.
						And Themistocles replied, that Chrysippus only proposed
						such things by the by, as instances to correct us, who
						easily and without any reason assent to what seems likely,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.225"/>
						
						and disbelieve every thing that seems unlikely at the first
						sight. But why, sir, are you concerned at this? For if
						you are speculative and would enquire into the causes of
						things, you need not want subjects in your own profession;
						but pray tell me why Homer makes Nausicaa wash in the
						river rather than the sea, though it was near, and in all
						likelihood hotter, clearer, and fitter to wash with than that?</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>And Theon replied: Aristotle hath already given an
						account for this from the grossness of the sea water; for
						in this an abundance of rough earthy particles is mixed,
						and those make it salt; and upon this account swimmers
						or any other weights sink not so much in sea water as in
						fresh, for the latter, being thin and weak, yields to every
						pressure and is easily divided, because it is pure and unmixed; and by reason of this subtility of parts it penetrates
						better than salt water, and so looseneth from the clothes
						the sticking particles of the spot. And is not this discourse
						of Aristotle very probable?</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Probable indeed, I replied, but not true; for I have
						observed that with ashes, gravel, or, if these are not to be
						gotten, with dust itself they usually thicken the water, as
						if the earthy particles being rough would scour better than
						fair water, whose thinness makes it weak and ineffectual.
						Therefore he is mistaken when he says the thickness of
						the sea water hinders the effect, since the sharpness of the
						mixed particles very much conduces to make it cleansing;
						for that opens the pores, and draws out the stain. But
						since all oily matter is most difficult to be washed out
						and spots a cloth, and the sea is oily, that is the reason
						why it doth not scour as well as fresh; and that it is oily,
						even Aristotle himself asserts, for salt in his opinion hath
						some oil in it, and therefore makes candles, when sprinkled
						on them, burn the better and clearer than before. And sea
						water sprinkled on a flame increaseth it, and is more easily
						kindled than any other; and this, in my opinion, makes it
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.226"/>
						
						hotter than the fresh. Besides, I may urge another cause;
						for the end of washing is drying, and that seems cleanest
						which is driest; and the moisture that scours (as hellebore,
						with the humors that it purges) ought to fly away quickly
						together with the stain. The sun quickly draws out the
						fresh water, because it is so light; but the salt water
						being rough lodges in the pores, and therefore is not easily
						dried.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>And Theon replied: You say just nothing, sir; for
						Aristotle in the same book affirms that those that wash in
						the sea, if they stand in the fresh sun, are sooner dried
						than those that wash in the fresh streams. It is true, I
						answered, he says so; but I hope that Homer asserting
						the contrary will, by you especially, be more easily believed;
						for Ulysses (as he writes) after his shipwreck meeting
						Nausicaa,
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">A frightful sight, and with the salt besmeared,</quote>

						from the elegies of Aeschylus, who had himself fought
						valiantly in the same encounter; and farther evinced that
						Callimachus the field marshal was of that tribe, who behaved himself very bravely, and was the principal cause

						proper seats, or leave the guests to agree upon their own?
						Of the second, Why lovers are inclined to poetry? and
						the question about the tribe Aeantis. The former I call
						properly <foreign lang="greek">sumpotika/</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">table-talk,</hi> but both together I comprehend under the general name of Symposiacs. They are
						promiscuously set down, not in any exact method, but as
						each singly occurred to memory. And let not my readers
						wonder that I dedicate these collections to you, which I
						have received from others or your own mouth; for if all
						learning is not bare remembrance, yet to learn and to remember are very commonly one and the same thing.</p>

						<lb/> WHAT, AS XENOPHON INTIMATES, ARE THE MOST AGREEABLE QUESTIONS AND MOST PLEASANT RAILLERY AT AN ENTERTAINMENT?

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>Now each book being divided into ten questions, that
						shall make the first in this, which Socratical Xenophon
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.230"/>
						
						hath as it were proposed; for he tells us that, Gobryas
						banqueting with Cyrus, amongst other things that he found
						admirable in the Persians, he was surprised to hear them
						ask one another such questions that it was more delightful
						to be interrogated than to be let alone, and pass such jests
						on one another that it was more pleasant to be jested on
						than not. For if some, even whilst they praise, offend,
						why should not their polite and neat facetiousness be admired, whose very raillery is delightful and pleasant to him
						that is the subject of it? Once when you were entertaining
						us at Patrae, you said: I wish I could learn what kind of
						questions those are; for to be skilled in and make right
						use of apposite questions and pleasant raillery, I think is
						no small part of conversation.</p>

                  <p>A considerable one, I replied; but pray observe
						whether Xenophon himself, in his descriptions of Socrates's
						and the Persian entertainments, hath not sufficiently explained them. But if you would have my thoughts,&mdash;first,
						men are pleased to be asked those questions to which they
						have an answer ready; such are those in which the persons
						asked have some skill and competent knowledge; for when
						the enquiry is above their reach, those that can return nothing are troubled, as if requested to give something beyond
						their power; and those that do answer, producing some
						crude and insufficient demonstration, must needs be very
						much concerned, and apt to blunder on the wrong. Now,
						if the answer not only is easy but hath something not
						common, it is more pleasing to them that make it; and
						this happens, when their knowledge is greater than that of
						the vulgar, as suppose they are well skilled in points of
						astrology or logic. For not only in action and serious
						matters, but also in discourse, every one hath a natural
						disposition to be pleased (as Euripides hath it)

                  <p>As for raillery, those that cannot use it cautiously
						with art, and time it well, should never venture at it. For
						as in a slippery place, if you but just touch a man as
						you pass by, you throw him down; so when we are in
						drink, we are in danger of tripping at every little word
						that is not spoken with due address. And we are sometimes more offended with a joke than a plain and scurrilous abuse; for we see the latter often slip from a man
						unwittingly in passion, but consider the former as a thing
						voluntary, proceeding from malice and ill-nature; and
						therefore we are generally more offended at a sharp jeerer
						than a whistling snarler. Such a jeer has indeed something artfully malicious about it, and often seems to be an
						insult devised and thought of beforehand. For instance,
						he that calls thee salt-fish monger plainly and openly abuseth; but he that says, I remember when you wiped your
						nose upon your sleeve, maliciously jeers. Such was Cicero's
						to Octavius, who was thought to be descended from an
						African; for when Cicero spoke something, and Octavius
						said he did not hear him, Cicero rejoined, Strange, for you
						have a hole through your ear. And Melanthius, when he
						was ridiculed by a comedian, said, You pay me now something that you do not owe me. And upon this account
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.234"/>
						
						jeers vex more; for like bearded arrows they stick a long
						while, and gall the wounded sufferer. Their smartness is
						pleasant, and delights the company; and those that are
						pleased with the saying seem to believe the detracting
						speaker. For, according to Theophrastus, a jeer is a figurative reproach for some fault or misdemeanor; and therefore he that hears it supplies the concealed part, as if he
						knew and gave credit to the thing. For he that laughs
						and is tickled at what Theocritus said to one whom he
						suspected of a design upon his purse, and who asked him
						if he went to supper at such a place,&mdash;Yes, he replied, I
						go, but shall likewise lodge there all night,&mdash;doth, as it
						were confirm the accusation, and believe the fellow was a
						thief. Therefore an impertinent jeerer makes the whole
						company seem ill-natured and abusive, as being pleased
						with and consenting to the scurrility of the jeer. It was
						one of the excellent rules in Sparta, that none should be
						bitter in their jests, and the jeered should patiently endure; but if he took offence, the other was to forbear, and
						pursue the frolic no farther. How is it possible therefore
						to determine such raillery as shall delight and please the
						person that is jested on, when to be smart without offence
						is no mean piece of cunning and address?</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="5">
                  <p>First then, such as will vex and gall the conscious
						must please those that are clean, innocent, and not suspected of the matter. Such a joke is Xenophon's, when
						he pleasantly brings in a very ugly ill-looking fellow, and is
						smart upon him for being Sambaulas's minion. Such was
						that of Aufidius Modestus, who, when our friend Quintius
						in an ague complained his hands were cold, replied, Sir,
						you brought them warm from your province; for this made
						Quintius laugh, and extremely pleased him; yet it had
						been a reproach and abuse to a covetous and oppressing
						governor. Thus Socrates, pretending to compare faces
						with the beauteous Critobulus, rallied only, and not abused.
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.235"/>
						
						And Alcibiades again was smart on Socrates, as his rival
						in Agatho's affection. Kings are pleased when jests are
						put upon them as if they were private and poor men.
						Such was the flatterer's to Philip, who chided him: Sir, don't
						I keep you? For those that mention faults of which the
						persons are not really guilty intimate those virtues with
						which they are really adorned. But then it is requisite
						that those virtues should be evident and certainly belong
						to them; otherwise the discourse will breed disturbance
						and suspicion. He that tells a very rich man that he will
						procure him a sum of money,&mdash;a temperate sober man,
						and one that drinks water only, that he is foxed, or hath
						taken a cup too much,&mdash;a hospitable, generous, good-humored man, that he is a niggard and pinch-penny,&mdash;or
						threatens an excellent lawyer to meet him at the bar,&mdash;
						must make the persons smile and please the company.
						Thus Cyrus was very obliging and complaisant, when he
						challenged his play-fellows at those sports in which he
						was sure to be overcome. And Ismenias piping at a sacrifice, when no good omens appeared, the man that hired
						him snatched the pipe, and played very ridiculously himself;
						and when all found fault, he said: To play satisfactorily
						is the gift of Heaven. And Ismenias with a smile replied:
						Whilst I played, the Gods were so well pleased that they
						were careless of the sacrifice; but to be rid of thy noise
						they presently received it.</p>

                  <p>Butt more, those that jocosely put scandalous names

						more than he that plainly and openly commends; for those
						that cover a reproach under fair and respectful words (as
						he that calls an unjust man Aristides, a coward Achilles)

               <div3 type="section" n="7">
                  <p>Again, a complaint that implies thankfulness for a

                  <p>For it had not been half so pleasant to have said, that

               <div3 type="section" n="8">
                  <p>Besides, he that would be civilly facetious must know
						the difference between a vice and a commendable study or

						if twitted with the former, but take it very well if they are

						give me a talent.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="9">
                  <p>In several things about the body too the like caution
						is to be observed. Thus he that is jested on for a flat or
						hooked nose usually laughs at the jest. Thus Cassander's friend was not at all displeased when Theophrastus
						said to him, 'Tis strange, sir, that your eyes don't sing,
						since your nose is so near to give them the tune; and
						Cyrus commanded a long hawk-nosed fellow to marry a
						flat-nosed girl, for then they would very well agree. But
						a jest on any for his stinking breath or filthy nose is irksome; for baldness it may be borne, but for blindness or
						infirmity in the eyes it is intolerable. It is true, Antigonus
						would joke upon himself, and once, receiving a petition
						written in great letters, he said, This a man may read if
						he were stark blind. But he killed Theocritus the Chian
						for saying,&mdash;when one told him that as soon as he appeared before the King's eyes he would be pardoned,&mdash;Sir, then it is impossible for me to be saved. And the
						Byzantine to Pasiades saying, Sir, your eyes are weak,
						replied, You upbraid me with this infirmity, not considering that thy son carries the vengeance of Heaven on his
						back: now Pasiades's son was hunch-backed. And Archippus the popular Athenian was much displeased with
						Melanthius for being smart on his crooked back; for
						Melanthius had said that he did not stand at the head of
						the state (<foreign lang="greek">proesta/nai</foreign>) but bowed down before it (<foreign lang="greek">prokekufe/nai</foreign>).
						It is true, some are not much concerned at such jeers.
						Thus Antigonus's friend, when he had begged a talent and
						was denied, desired a guard, lest somebody should rob him
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.238"/>
						
						of that talent he was now to carry home. Different tempers make men differently affected, and that which troubles
						one is not regarded by another. Epaminondas feasting
						with his fellow-magistrates drank vinegar; and some asking if it was good for his health, he replied, I cannot tell
						that, but I know it makes me remember what I drink at
						home. Therefore it becomes every man that would rally,
						to look into the humors of his company, and take heed to
						converse without offence.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="10">
                  <p>Love, as in most things else, so in this matter causes
						different effects; for some lovers are pleased and some displeased at a merry jest. Therefore in this case a fit time
						must be accurately observed; for as a blast of wind puffs
						out a fire whilst it is weak and little, but when thoroughly
						kindled strengthens and increaseth it; so love, before it is
						evident and confessed, is displeased at a discoverer, but
						when it breaks forth and blazes in everybody's eyes, then
						it is delighted and gathers strength by the frequent blasts
						of joke and raillery. When their beloved is present it will
						gratify them most to pass a jest upon their passion, but to
						fall on any other subject will be counted an abuse. If
						they are remarkably loving to their own wives, or entertain
						a generous affection for a hopeful youth, then are they
						proud, then tickled when jeered for such a love. And
						therefore Arcesilaus, when an amorous man in his school
						laid down this proposition, In my opinion one thing cannot touch another, replied, Sir, you touch this person,
						pointing to a lovely boy that sat near him.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="11">
                  <p>Besides, the company must be considered; for what
						a man will only laugh at when mentioned amongst his
						friends and familiar acquaintance, he will not endure to be
						told of before his wife, father, or tutor, unless perhaps it
						be something that will please those too; as for instance,
						if before a philosopher one should jeer a man for going

						<pb id="v.3.p.239"/>
						
						carefulness and thrift; or in the presence of his wife, for
						being cold to his companions and doating upon her. Thus
						Tigranes, when Cyrus asked him, What will your wife say
						when she hears that you are put to servile offices? replied,
						Sir, she will not hear it, but be present herself and see it.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="12">
                  <p>Again, those jokes are accounted less affronting
						which reflect somewhat also on the man that makes them;
						as when one poor man, base-born fellow, or lover jokes
						upon another. For whatever comes from one in the same
						circumstances looks more like a piece of mirth than a
						designed affront; but otherwise it must needs be irksome
						and distasteful. Upon this account, when a slave whom
						the King had lately feed and enriched behaved himself
						very impertinently in the company of some philosophers,
						asking them, how it came to pass that the broth of beans,
						whether white or black, was always green, Aridices putting another question, why, let the whips be white or not,
						the wales and marks they made were still red, displeased
						him extremely, and made him rise from the table in a
						great rage and discontent. But Amphias the Tarsian, who
						was supposed to be sprung from a gardener, joking upon
						the governor's friend for his obscure and mean birth, and
						presently subjoining, But 'tis true, I sprung from the same
						seed, caused much mirth and laughter. And the harper
						very facetiously put a check to Philip's ignorance and impertinence; for when Philip pretended to correct him, he
						cried out, God forbid, sir, that ever you should be brought
						so low as to understand these things better than I. For
						by this seeming joke he instructed him without giving any
						offence. Therefore some of the comedians seem to lay
						aside their bitterness in every jest that may reflect upon
						themselves; as Aristophanes, when he is merry upon a
						bald-pate; and Cratinus in his play Pytine upon drunkenness and excess.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>IN Eleusis, after the solemn celebration of the sacred
							mysteries, Glaucias the orator entertained us at a feast;
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.241"/>
							
							where, after the rest had done, Xenocles of Delphi, as his
							humor is, began to be smart upon my brother Lamprias for
							his good Boeotian stomach. I in his defence opposing
							Xenocles, who was an Epicurean, said, Pray, sir, do not all
							place the very essence of pleasure in privation of pain and
							suffering? But Lamprias, who prefers the Lyceum before
							the Garden, ought by his practice to confirm Aristotle's
							doctrine; for he affirms that every man hath a better
							stomach in the autumn than in other seasons of the year,
							and gives the reason, which I cannot remember at present.
							So much the better (says Glaucias), for when supper is
							done, we will endeavor to discover it ourselves. That being over, Glaucias and Xenocles drew various reasons from
							the autumnal fruit. One said, that it scoured the body,
							and by this evacuation continually raised new appetites.
							Xenocles affirmed, that ripe fruit had usually a pleasing
							vellicating sapor, and thereby provoked the appetite better
							than sauces or sweetmeats; for sick men of a vitiated
							stomach usually recover it by eating fruit. But Lamprias
							said, that our natural heat, the principal instrument of nutrition, in the midst of summer is scattered and becomes
							rare and weak, but in autumn it unites again and gathers
							strength, being shut in by the ambient cold and contraction
							of the pores. I for my part said: In summer we are more
							thirsty and use more moisture than in other seasons; and
							therefore Nature, observing the same method in all her
							operations, at this change of seasons employs the contrary
							and makes us hungry; and to maintain an equal temper in
							the body, she gives us dry food to countervail the moisture
							taken in the summer. Yet none can deny but that the
							food itself is a partial cause; for not only new fruit, bread,
							or corn, but flesh of the same year, is better tasted than that
							of the former, more forcibly provokes the guests, and enticeth them to eat on.

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Soon after he proposed that perplexed question, that
						plague of the inquisitive, Which was first, the bird or the
						egg? And my friend Sylla, saying that with this little
						question, as with an engine, we shook the great and
						weighty question (whether the world had a beginning),
						declared his dislike of such problems. But Alexander deriding the question as slight and impertinent, my relation
						Firmus said: Well, sir, at present your atoms will do me
						some service; for if we suppose that small things must be
						the principles of greater, it is likely that the egg was before the bird; for an egg amongst sensible things is very
						simple, and the bird is more mixed, and contains a greater
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.243"/>
						
						variety of parts. It is universally true, that a principle is
						before that whose principle it is; now the seed is a principle, and the egg is somewhat more than the seed, and less
						than the bird; for as a disposition or a progress in goodness is something between a tractable mind and a habit of
						virtue, so an egg is as it were a progress of Nature tending
						from the seed to a perfect animal. And as in an animal they
						say the veins and arteries are formed first, upon the same
						account the egg should be before the bird, as the thing
						containing before the thing contained. Thus art first
						makes rude and ill-shapen figures, and afterwards perfects
						every thing with its proper form; and it was for this
						reason that the statuary Polycletus said, Then our work is
						most difficult, when the clay comes to be fashioned by the
						nail. So it is probable that matter, not readily obeying the
						slow motions of contriving Nature, at first frames rude and
						indefinite masses, as the egg, and of these moulded anew,
						and joined in better order, the animal afterward is formed.
						As the canker is first, and then growing dry and cleaving
						lets forth a winged animal, called psyche; so the egg is
						first as it were the subject matter of the generation. For
						it is certain that, in every change, that out of which the
						thing changes must be before the thing changing. Observe how worms and caterpillars are bred in trees from
						the moisture corrupted or concocted; now none can say
						but that the engendering moisture is naturally before all
						these. For (as Plato says) matter is as a mother or nurse
						in respect of the bodies that are formed, and we call that
						matter out of which any thing that is is made. And with
						a smile continued he, I speak to those that are acquainted
						with the mystical and sacred discourse of Orpheus, who
						not only affirms the egg to be before the bird, but makes it
						the first being in the whole world. The other parts, because deep mysteries (as Herodotus would say), we shall
						now pass by; but let us look upon the various kinds of
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.244"/>
						
						animals, and we shall find almost every one beginning
						from an egg,&mdash;fowls and fishes; land animals, as lizards;
						amphibious, as crocodiles; some with two legs, as a
						cock; some without any, as a snake; and some with
						many, as a locust. And therefore in the solemnly feast of
						Bacchus it is very well done to dedicate an egg, as the
						emblem of that which begets and contains every thing
						in itself.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>To this discourse of Firmus, Senecio replied: Sir,
						your last similitude contradicts your first, and you have unwittingly opened the world (instead of the door, as the
						saying is) against yourself. For the world was before all,
						being the most perfect; and it is rational that the perfect
						in Nature should be before the imperfect, as the sound before the maimed, and the whole before the part. For it is
						absurd that there should be a part when there is nothing
						whose part it is; and therefore nobody says the seed's
						man or egg's hen, but the man's seed and hen's egg; because those being after these and formed in them, pay as it
						were a debt to Nature, by bringing forth another. For
						they are not in themselves perfect, and therefore have a
						natural appetite to produce such a thing as that out of
						which they were first formed; and therefore seed is defined as a telling produced that is to be perfected by another
						production. Now nothing can be perfected by or want
						that which as yet is not. Everybody sees that eggs have
						the nature of a concretion or consistence in some animal or
						other, but want those organs, veins, and muscles which animals enjoy. Therefore no story delivers that ever any egg
						was formed immediately from earth; and the poets themselves tell us, that the egg out of which came the Tyndaridae
						fell down from heaven. But even till this time the earth
						produceth some perfect and organized animals, as mice in
						Egypt, and snakes, frogs, and grasshoppers almost everywhere, some external and invigorating principle assisting
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.245"/>
						
						in the production. And in Sicily, where in the servile war
						much blood was shed, and many carcasses rotted on the
						ground, whole swarms of locusts were produced, and
						spoiled the corn over the whole isle. Such spring from
						and are nourished by the earth; and seed being formed in
						them, pleasure and titillation provoke them to mix, upon
						which some lay eggs, and some bring forth their young
						alive; and this evidently proves that animals first sprang
						from earth, and afterwards by copulation, after different
						ways, propagated their several kinds. In short, it is the
						same thing as if you said the womb was before the woman;
						for as the womb is to the egg, the egg is to the chick that
						is formed in it; so that he that inquires how birds should
						be when there were no eggs, might ask as well how men
						and women could be before any organs of generation were
						formed. Parts generally have their subsistence together
						with the whole; particular powers follow particular members, and operations follow those powers, and effects those
						operations. Now the effect of the generative power is the
						seed and egg; so that these must be after the formation of
						the whole. Therefore consider, as there can be no digestion of food before the animal is formed, so there can be
						no seed nor egg; for those, it is likely, are made by some
						digestion and alterations; nor can it be that, before the
						animal is, the superfluous parts of the food of the animal
						should have a being. Besides, though seed may perhaps
						pretend to be a principle, the egg cannot; for it doth not
						subsist first, nor hath it the nature of a whole, for it is imperfect. Therefore we do not affirm that the animal is
						produced without a principle of its being; but we call the
						principle that power which changes, mixes, and tempers
						the matter, so that a living creature is regularly produced;
						but the egg is an after-production, as the blood or milk of
						an animal after the taking in and digestion of the food.
						For we never see an egg formed immediately of mud, for
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.246"/>
						
						it is produced in the bodies of animals alone; but a thousand living creatures rise from the mud. What need of
						many instances? None ever found the spawn or egg of
						an eel; yet if you empty a pit and take out all the mud,
						as soon as other water settles in it, eels likewise are presently produced. Now that must exist first which hath no
						need of any other thing that it may exist, and that after,
						which cannot be without the concurrence of another thing.
						And of this priority is our present discourse. Besides,
						birds build nests before they lay their eggs; and women
						provide cradles, swaddling-clothes, and the like; yet who
						says that the nest is before the egg, or the swaddling-clothes before the infant? For the earth (as Plato says)
						doth not imitate a woman, but a woman, and so likewise
						all other females, the earth. Moreover it is probable that
						the first production out of the earth, which was then vigorous and perfect, was self-sufficient and entire, nor stood
						in need of those secundines, membranes, and vessels, which
						now Nature forms to help the weakness and supply the
						defects of breeders.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>SOSICLES of Coronea having at the Pythian games won
							the prize from all the poets, we gave him an entertainment. And the time for running, cuffing, wrestling, and
							the like drawing on, there was a great talk of the wrestlers; for there were many and very famous men, who came
							to try their skill. Lysimachus, one of the company, a
							procurator of the Amphictyons, said he heard a grammarian lately affirm that wrestling was the most ancient
							exercise of all, as even the very name witnessed; for

							<pb id="v.3.p.247"/>
							
							transferred to them; thus tuning a pipe is called fitting
							it, and playing on it is called striking; both these being
							transferred to it from the harp. Thus all places of exercise they call wrestling schools, wrestling being the oldest
							exercise, and therefore denominating the newer sorts.
							That, said I, is no good argument, for these palaestras or
							wrestling schools are called so from wrestling (<foreign lang="greek">pa/lh</foreign>), not
							because it is the most ancient exercise, but because it is
							the only sort in which they use clay (<foreign lang="greek">phlo/s</foreign>), dust, and oil;
							for in these there is neither racing nor cuffing, but wrestling only, and that part of the pancratium in which they
							struggle on the ground,&mdash;for the pancratium comprises.
							both wrestling and cuffing. Besides, it is unlikely that
							wrestling, being more artificial and methodical than any
							other sort of exercise, should likewise be the most ancient;
							for mere want or necessity, putting us upon new inventions, produces simple and inartificial things first, and such
							as have more of force in them than sleight and skill. This
							ended, Sosicles said: You speak right, and I will confirm
							your discourse from the very name; for, in my opinion,
							<foreign lang="greek">pa/lh</foreign>, wrestling, is derived from <foreign lang="greek">pale/uein</foreign>, i. e. to throw down
							by sleight and artifice. And Philinus said, it seems to me
							to be derived from <foreign lang="greek">palaisth/</foreign>, the palm of the hand, for
							wrestlers use that part most, as cuffers do the <foreign lang="greek">pugmh/</foreign>, fist;
							and hence both these sorts of exercises have their proper
							names, the one <foreign lang="greek">pa/lh</foreign>, the other <foreign lang="greek">pugmh/</foreign>. Besides, since the
							poets use the word <foreign lang="greek">palu/nein</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">katapa/ssein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">sumpa/ssein</foreign>, to
							sprinkle, and this action is most frequent amongst wrestlers, this exercise <foreign lang="greek">pa/lh</foreign> may receive its name from that
							word. But more, consider that racers strive to be distant
							from one another; cuffers, by the judges of the field, are
							not permitted to take hold; and none but wrestlers come
							up close breast to breast, and clasp one another round the
							waist, and most of their turnings, liftings, lockings, bring
							them very close. It is probable therefore that this exercise
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.248"/>
							
							 is called <foreign lang="greek">pa/lh</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">plhsia/zein</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">pe/las gi/gnesqai</foreign>, to come up

                  <p>And Philo subjoined: There is, Crato, a reason for
						this amongst the philosophers, which the gardeners confirm and strengthen. For they say, oil is very hurtful to
						all plants, and any plant dipped in it, like a bee, will soon
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.251"/>
						
						die. Now these trees are of a fat and oily nature, insomuch that they weep pitch and rosin; and, if you cut them
						gore (as it were) appears presently in the wound. Besides,
						a torch made of them sends forth an oily smoke, and the
						brightness of the flame shows it to be fat; and upon this
						account these trees are as great enemies to all other
						kinds of grafts as oil itself. To this Crato added, that
						the bark was a partial cause; for that, being rare and dry,
						could not afford either convenient room or sufficient nourishment to the grafts; but when the bark is moist, it
						quickly joins with those grafts that are let into the body
						of the tree.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Then Soclarus added: This too ought to be considered, that that which receives a graft of another kind ought
						to be easy to be changed, that the graft may prevail, and
						make the sap in the stock fit and natural to itself. Thus
						we break up the ground and soften it, that being thus
						broken it may more easily be wrought upon, and applied
						to what we plant in it; for things that are hard and rigid
						cannot be so quickly wrought upon nor so easily changed.
						Now those trees, being of very light wood, do not mix
						well with the grafts, because they are very hard either to
						be changed or overcome. But more, it is manifest that the
						stock which receives the graft should be instead of a soil
						to it, and a soil should have a breeding faculty; and therefore we choose the most fruitful stocks to graft on, as
						women that are full of milk, when we would put out a
						child to nurse. But everybody knows that the fir, cypress,
						and the like are no great bearers. For as men very fat
						have few children (for, the whole nourishment being employed in the body, there remains no overplus to make
						seed), so these trees, spending all their sap in their
						own stock, flourish indeed and grow great; but as for
						fruit, some bear none at all, some very little, and that too
						slowly ripens; therefore it is no wonder that they will
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.252"/>
						
						not nourish another's fruit, when they are so very sparing
						to their own.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>CHAEREMONIANUS the Trallian, when we were at a very
						noble fish dinner, pointing to a little, long, sharp-headed
						fish, said the echeneis (ship-stopper) was like that, for he
						had often seen it as he sailed in the Sicilian sea, and
						wondered at its strange force; for it stopped the ship when
						under full sail, till one of the seamen perceived it sticking
						to the outside of the ship, and took it off. Some laughed
						at Chaeremonianus for believing such an incredible and
						unlikely story. Others on this occasion talked very much
						of antipathies, and produced a thousand instances of such
						strange effects; for example, the sight of a ram quiets an
						enraged elephant; a viper lies stock-still, if touched with a
						beechen leaf; a wild bull grows tame, if bound with the
						twigs of a fig-tree; amber draws all light things to it, except basil and such as are dipped in oil; and a loadstone
						will not draw a piece of iron that is rubbed with garlic. Now
						all these, as to matter of fact, are very evident; but it is
						hard, if not altogether impossible, to find the cause.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Then said I: This is a mere shift and avoiding of
						the question, rather than a declaration of the cause; but
						if we please to consider, we shall find a great many accidents that are only consequents of the effect to be unjustly esteemed the causes of it; as for instance, if we
						should fancy that by the blossoming of the chaste-tree

							is the cause and not an accident consequential to an internal ulcer. Therefore as those things mentioned are but
							consequents to the effect, though proceeding from one and
							the same cause, so one and the same cause stops the ship,
							and joins the echeneis to it; for the ship continuing dry,
							not yet made heavy by the moisture soaking into the wood,
							it is probable that it glides lightly, and as long as it is
							clean, easily cuts the waves; but when it is thoroughly
							soaked, when weeds, ooze, and filth stick upon its sides,
							the stroke of the ship is more obtuse and weak; and the
							water, coming upon this clammy matter, doth not so easily
							part from it; and this is the reason why they usually scrape
							the sides of their ships. Now it is likely that the echeneis
							in this case, sticking upon the clammy matter, is not thought
							an accidental consequent to this cause, but the very cause
							itself.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AFTER the former discourse, mention was made of those
							sheep that wolves have bitten; for it is commonly said of
							them, that their flesh is very sweet, and their wool breeds
							lice. Our relation Patroclias seemed to be pretty happy
							in his reasoning upon the first part, saying, that the beast
							by biting it did mollify the flesh; for wolves' spirits are so
							hot and fiery, that they soften and digest the hardest
							bones; and for the same reason things bitten by wolves
							rot sooner than others. But concerning the wool we could
							not agree, being not fully resolved whether it breeds those
							lice, or only opens a passage for them, separating the flesh
							by its fretting roughness or proper warmth; and it seemed
							that this power proceeded from the bite of the wolf, which
							alters even the very hair of the creature that it kills. And
							this some particular instances seem to confirm; for we
							know some huntsmen and cooks will kill a beast with one
							stroke, so that it never breathes after, whilst others repeat
							their blows, and scarce do it with a great deal of trouble.
							But (what is more strange) some, as they kill it, infuse
							such a quality that the flesh rots presently and cannot be
							kept sweet above a day; yet others that despatch it as
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.255"/>
							
							soon find no such alteration, but the flesh will keep sweet
							a long while. And that by the manner of killing a great
							alteration is made even in the skins, nails, and hair of a
							beast, Homer seems to witness, when, speaking of a good
							hide, he says,

               <head>Question X.
						<lb/> WHETHER THE ANCIENTS, WHO PROVIDED EVERY ONE HIS MESS, DID BETTER THAN WE, WHO SET MANY TO THE SAME DISH.
						<lb/> PLUTARCH, HAGIAS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>WHEN I was chief magistrate, most of the suppers
						consisted of distinct messes, where every particular guest
						had his portion of the sacrifice allowed him. Some were
						wonderfully well pleased with this order; others blamed it
						as unsociable and ungenteel, and were of the opinion that,
						as soon as I was out of my office, the manner of entertainments ought to be reformed; for, says Hagias, we invite
						one another not barely to eat and drink, but to eat and
						drink together. Now this division into messes takes away
						all society, makes many suppers, and many eaters, but no
						one sups with another; but every man takes his pound of
						beef, as from the market, sets it before himself, and falls
						on. And is it not the same thing to provide a different
						cup and different table for every guest (as the Demophontidae treated Orestes), as now to set each man his loaf of
						bread and mess of meat, and feed him, as it were, out of
						his own proper manger? Only, it is true, we are not (as
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.256"/>
						
						those that treated Orestes were) obliged to be silent and
						not discourse. Besides, to show that all the guests should
						have a share in every thing, we may draw an argument
						from hence;&mdash;the same discourse is common to us all, the
						same songstress sings, the same musician plays to all. So,
						when the same cup is set in the midst, not appropriated to
						any, it is a large spring of good fellowship, and each man
						may take as much as his appetite requires; not like this
						most unjust distribution of bread and meat, which prides
						itself forsooth in being equal to all, though unequal,
						stomachs; for the same portion to a man of a small appetite is too much; to one of a greater, too little. And, sir, as
						he that administers the very same dose of physic to all sorts
						of patients must be very ridiculous; so likewise must that
						entertainer who, inviting a great many guests that can
						neither eat nor drink alike, sets before every one an equal
						mess, and measures what is just and fit by an arithmetical
						not geometrical proportion. When we go to a shop to
						buy, we all use, it is true, one and the same public
						measure; but to an entertainment each man brings his
						own belly, which is satisfied with a portion, not because it
						is equal to that which others have, but because it is sufficient for
						itself. Those entertainments where every one
						had his single mess Homer mentions amongst soldiers and
						in the camp, which we ought not to bring into fashion
						amongst us; but we should rather imitate the good friendship of the ancients, who, to show what reverence they
						had for all kinds of societies, not only honored those that
						lived with them or under the same roof, but also those that
						drank out of the same cup or ate out of  same dish.
						Let us never mind Homer's entertainments; they were
						good for nothing but to starve a man, and the makers of
						them were kings, more stingy and observant than the
						Italian cooks; insomuch that in the midst of a battle,
						whilst they were at handy-blows with their enemies, they
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.257"/>
						
						could exactly reckon up how many glasses each man drank
						at his table. Those that Pindar describes are much better,
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">Where heroes mixed sat round the noble board,</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>because they maintained society and good fellowship; for
							the latter truly mixed and joined friends, but this modern
							custom divides and asperses them as persons who, though
							seemingly very good friends, cannot so much as eat with
							one another out of the same dish.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>To this polite discourse of Hagias they urged me to
						reply. And I said: Hagias, it is true, hath reason to be
						troubled at this unusual disappointment, because having so
						great a belly (for he was an excellent trencher-man) he had
						no larger mess than others; for in a fish eaten in common,
						Democritus says, there are no bones. But that very thing
						is especially apt to bring us a share beyond our own proper
						allowance. For it is equality, as the old woman in Euripides hath it,

                  </p>
                  <p>and entertainments chiefly stand in need of this. The
							necessity is from nature as well as custom, and is not lately
							introduced or founded only on opinion. For when the
							same dish lies in common before all, the man that is slow
							and eats little must be offended at the other that is too
							quick for him, as a slow ship at the swift sailer. Besides,
							snatching, contention, shoving, and the like, are not, in my
							mind, neighborly beginnings of mirth and jollity; but they
							are absurd, doggish, and often end in anger or reproaches,
							not only against one another, but also against the entertainer himself or the carvers of the feast. But as long as
							Moera and Lachesis (<hi rend="italics">division</hi> and <hi rend="italics">distribution</hi>) kept an
							equality in feasts, nothing uncivil or disorderly appeared,
							and they called the feasts <foreign lang="greek">dai=tes</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">distributions,</hi> the entertained
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.258"/>
							
							              <foreign lang="greek">daitumo/nes</foreign>, and the carvers <foreign lang="greek">daitroi/</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">distributers,</hi> from
							dividing and distributing to every man his proper mess.
							The Lacedaemonians had officers called distributers of the
							flesh, no mean men, but the chief of the city; for Lysander
							himself by King Agesilaus was constituted one of these in
							Asia. But when luxury crept into our feasts, distributing was thrown out; for I suppose they had not leisure to
							divide these numerous tarts, cheese-cakes, pies, and other
							delicate varieties; but, surprised with the pleasantness of
							the taste and tired with the variety, they left off cutting it
							into portions, and left all in common. This is confirmed
							from the present practice; for in our religious or public
							feasts, where the food is simple and inartificial, each man
							hath his mess assigned him; so that he that endeavors to
							retrieve the ancient custom will likewise recover thrift
							and almost lost frugality again. But, you object, where
							only property is, community is lost. True indeed, where
							equality is not; for not the possession of what is proper
							and our own, but the taking away of another's and coveting that which is common, is the cause of all injury and
							contention; and the laws, restraining and confining these
							within the bounds of propriety, receive their name from
							their office, being a power distributing equality to every
							one in order to the common good. Thus every one is not
							to be honored by the entertainer with the garland or the
							chiefest place; but if any one brings with him his sweet
							heart or a minstrel-wench, they must be common to him
							and his friends, that all things may be huddled together in
							one mass, as Anaxagoras would have it. Now if propriety
							in these things doth not in the least hinder but that things
							of greater moment, and the only considerable, as discourse
							and civility, may be still common, let us leave off disgracing
							distributions or the lot, the son of Fortune (as Euripides
							hath it), which hath no respect either to riches or honor,
							but which in its inconsiderate wheel now and then raiseth
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.259"/>
							
							up the humble and the poor, and makes him master of
							himself, and, by accustoming the great and rich to endure

                  <p>AT Athens Erato the musician keeping a solemn feast

						some use or desired by natural appetite; for as those that
						are carried to a banquet by some of their invited friends
						(as, for instance, Socrates carried Aristodemus to Agatho's
						table) are as civilly entertained as the bidden guests, but

						their chaplets; but I, perceiving that Ammonius proposed
						this only for discourse and disputation's sake, applying

						have often heard you, what excellent preservatives these
						flowery garlands are against the strength of liquor. But
						here Erato putting in said: What, is it decreed that no
						pleasure must be admitted without profit? And must we
						be angry with our delight, unless hired to endure it? Perhaps we may have reason to be ashamed of ointments and
						purple vests, because so costly and expensive, and to look
						upon them as (in the barbarian's phrase) treacherous gar
						ments and deceitful odors; but these natural smells and
						colors are pure and simple as fruits themselves, and without expense or the curiosity of art. And I appeal to any
						one, whether it is not absurd to receive the pleasant tastes
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.262"/>
						
						Nature gives us, and reject those smells and colors that the
						seasons afford us, because forsooth they blossom with delight, if they have no other external profit or advantage.
						Besides, we have an axiom against you, for if (as you affirm) Nature makes nothing vain, those things that have no
						other use were designed on purpose to please and to delight.
						Besides, observe that to thriving trees Nature hath given
						leaves, for the preservation of the fruit and of the stock
						itself; for those sometimes warming sometimes cooling it,
						the seasons creep on by degrees, and do not assault it with
						all their violence at once. But now the flower, whilst it is
						on the plant, is of no profit at all, unless we use it to delight our nose with the admirable smell, and to please our
						eyes when it opens that inimitable variety of colors. And
						therefore, when the leaves are plucked off, the plants as it
						were suffer injury and grief. There is a kind of an ulcer
						raised, and an unbecoming nakedness attends them; and
						we must not only (as Empedocles says)
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">By all means spare the leaves that grace the palm,</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>but likewise the leaves of all other trees, and not injuriously against Nature robbing them of their leaves, bring
							deformity on them to adorn ourselves. But to pluck the
							flowers doth no injury at all. It is like gathering of grapes
							at the time of vintage; unless plucked when ripe, they
							wither of themselves and fall. And therefore, like the
							barbarians who clothe themselves with the skins more
							commonly than with the wool of sheep, those that wreathe

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Then Trypho taking the discourse said: The ancients were very curious and well acquainted with all these
						things, because plants were the chief ingredients of their
						physic. And of this some signs remain till now; for the
						Tyrians offer to the son of Agenor, and the Magnesians to
						Chiron, the first supposed practitioners of physic, as the
						first fruits, the roots of those plants which have been successful on a patient. And Bacchus was counted a physician not only for finding wine, the most pleasing and most
						potent remedy, but for bringing ivy, the greatest opposite
						imaginable to wine, into reputation, and for teaching his
						drunken followers to wear garlands of it, that by that means
						they might be secured against the violence of a debauch,
						the heat of the liquor being remitted by the coldness of
						the ivy. Besides, the names of several plants sufficiently
						evidence the ancients' curiosity in this matter; for they
						named the walnut-tree <foreign lang="greek">karu/a</foreign>, because it sends forth a heavy
						and drowsy (<foreign lang="greek">karwtiko/n</foreign>) spirit, which affects their heads who
						sleep beneath it; and the daffodil, <foreign lang="greek">na/rkissos</foreign>, because it benumbs the nerves and causes a stupid narcotic heaviness
						in the limbs; and therefore Sophocles calls it the ancient
						garland flower of the great (that is, the earthy) Gods. And
						some say rue was called <foreign lang="greek">ph/ganon</foreign> from its astringent quality; for, by its dryness proceeding from its heat, it fixes
						(<foreign lang="greek">ph/gnusi</foreign>) or coagulates the seed, and is very hurtful to great-bellied women. But those that imagine the herb amethyst
						(<foreign lang="greek">a)me/qustos</foreign>), and the precious stone of the same name, are
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.264"/>
						
						called so because powerful against the force of wine, are
						much mistaken; for both receive their names from their
						color; for its leaf is not of the color of strong wine, but
						resembles that of weak diluted liquor. And indeed I could
						mention a great many which have their names from their
						proper virtues. But the care and experience of the ancients sufficiently appears in those of which they made
						their garlands when they designed to be merry and frolic
						over a glass of wine; for wine, especially when it seizes on
						the head, and strains the body just at the very spring and
						origin of the sense, disturbs the whole man. Now the
						effluvia of flowers are an admirable preservative against
						this, they secure the brain, as it were a citadel, against the
						efforts of drunkenness; for those that are hot open the
						pores and give the fumes free passage to exhale, and those
						that are moderately cold repel and keep down the ascending vapors. Of this last nature are the violet and rose;
						for the odors of both these are prevalent against any ache
						and heaviness in the head. The flowers of privet and
						crocus bring those that have drunk freely into a gentle
						sleep; for they send forth a smooth and gentle effluvia,
						which softly takes off all asperities that arise in the body
						of the drunken; and so all things being quiet and composed, the violence of the noxious humor is abated and
						thrown off. The smells of some flowers being received
						into the brain cleanse the organs and instruments of sense,
						and gently by their heat, without any violence or force, dissolve the humors, and warm and cherish the brain itself,
						which is naturally cold. Upon this account, they called
						those little posies they hung about their necks <foreign lang="greek">u(poqu/mides</foreign>,
						and anointed their breasts with the oils that were squeezed
						from them; and of this Alcaeus is a witness, when he bids
						his friends,
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">

               <head>Question II.
						<lb/> WHETHER IVY IS OF A HOT OR COLD NATURE.
						<lb/> AMMONIUS, TRYPHO, ERATO.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>UPON this discourse, when we all hummed Trypho,
						Ammonius with a smile said: It is not decent by any contradiction to pull in pieces, like a chaplet, this various and
						florid discourse of Trypho's. Yet methinks the ivy is a
						little oddly interwoven, and unjustly said by its cold powers
						to temper the heat of strong wine; for it is rather fiery
						and hot, and its berries steeped in wine make the liquor
						more apt to inebriate and inflame. And from this cause,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.266"/>
						
						as in sticks warped by the fire, proceeds the crookedness
						of the boughs. And snow, that for many days will lie on
						other trees, presently melts from the branches of the ivy,
						and wastes all around, as far as the warmth reaches. But
						the greatest evidence is this. Theophrastus tells us, that
						when Alexander commanded Harpalus to plant some Grecian trees in the Babylonian gardens, and&mdash;because the
						climate is very hot and the sun violent&mdash;such as were leafy,
						thick, and fit to make a shade, the ivy only would not grow;
						though all art and diligence possible was used, it withered
						and died. For being hot itself, it could not agree with the
						fiery nature of the soil; for excess in similar qualities is destructive, and therefore we see every thing as it were affects
						its contrary; a cold plant flourishes in a hot ground, and a
						hot plant is delighted with a cold. Upon which account
						it is that bleak mountains, exposed to cold winds and snow,
						bear firs, pines, and the like, full of pitch, fiery, and excellent to make a torch. But besides, Trypho, trees of a cold
						nature, their little feeble heat not being able to diffuse
						itself but retiring to the heart, shed their leaves; but their
						natural oiliness and warmth preserve the laurel, olive, and
						cypress always green; and the like too in the ivy may be
						observed. And therefore it is not likely our dear friend
						Bacchus, who called wine <foreign lang="greek">me/qu</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">intoxicating</hi>) and himself
						<foreign lang="greek">mequmnai=os</foreign>, should bring ivy into reputation for being a preservative against drunkenness and an enemy to wine. But
						in my opinion, as lovers of wine, when they have not any
						juice of the grape ready, drink ale, mead, cider, or the
						like; thus he that in winter would have a vine-garland on
						his head, finding the vine naked and without leaves, used
						the ivy that is like it; for its boughs are twisted and
						irregular, its leaves moist and disorderly confused, but
						chiefly the berries, like ripening clusters, make an exact
						representation of the vine. But grant the ivy to be a preservative against drunkenness,&mdash;that to please you, Trypho,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.267"/>
						
						 we may call Bacchus a physician,&mdash;still I affirm that
						power to proceed from its heat, which either opens the
						pores or helps to digest the wine.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Upon this Trypho sat silent, studying for an answer.
						Erato addressing himself to us youths, said: Trypho wants
						your assistance; help him in this dispute about the garlands, or be content to sit without any. Ammonius too
						bade us not be afraid, for he would not reply to any of our
						discourses; and Trypho likewise urging me to propose
						something, I said: To demonstrate that the ivy is cold is
						not so proper a task for me as Trypho, for he often useth
						coolers and binders; but that proposition, that wine in
						which ivy berries have been is more inebriating, is not
						true; for that disturbance which it raiseth in those that
						drink it is not so properly called drunkenness as alienation
						of mind or madness, such as hyoscyamus and a thousand
						other things that set men beside themselves usually produce. The crookedness of the bough is no argument at
						all, for such violent and unnatural effects cannot be supposed to proceed from any natural quality or power. Now
						sticks are bent by the fire, because that draws the moisture, and so the crookedness is a violent distortion; but the
						natural heat nourishes and preserves the body. Consider
						therefore, whether it is not the weakness and coldness of
						the body that makes it wind, bend, and creep upon the
						ground; for those qualities check its rise, and depress it
						in its ascent, and render it like a weak traveller, that often
						sits down and then goes on again. Therefore the ivy
						requires something to twine about, and needs a prop;
						for it is not able to sustain and direct its own branches,
						because it wants heat, which naturally tends upward. The
						snow is melted by the wetness of the leaf, for water destroys it easily, passing through the thin contexture, it
						being nothing but a congeries of small bubbles; and therefore in very cold but moist places the snow melts as soon
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.268"/>
						
						as in hot. That it is continually green doth not proceed
						from its heat, for to shed its leaves doth not argue the
						coldness of a tree. Thus the myrtle and maiden-hair,
						though not hot, but confessedly cold, are green all the
						year. Some imagine this comes from the equal and duly
						proportioned mixture of the qualities in the leaf, to which
						Empedocles hath added a certain aptness of pores, through
						which the nourishing juice is orderly transmitted, so that
						there is still supply sufficient. But now it is otherwise in
						trees whose leaves fall, by reason of the wideness of their
						higher and narrowness of their lower pores; for the latter
						do not send juice enough, nor do the former keep it, but
						pour it out as soon as a small stock is received. This may
						be illustrated from the usual watering of our gardens;
						for when the distribution is unequal, the plants that are
						always watered have nourishment enough, seldom wither,
						and look always green. But you further argue, that being
						planted in Babylon it would not grow. It was well done
						of the plant, methinks, being a particular friend and familiar of the Boeotian God, to scorn to live amongst the
						barbarians, or imitate Alexander in following the manners
						of those nations; but it was not its heat but cold that
						was the cause of this aversion, for that could not agree
						with the contrary quality. For one similar quality doth
						not destroy but cherish another. Thus dry ground bears
						thyme, though it is naturally hot. Now at Babylon they
						say the air is so suffocating, so intolerably hot, that many
						of the merchants sleep upon skins full of water, that they
						may lie cool.

						<lb/> WHY WOMEN ARE HARDLY, OLD MEN EASILY, FOXED.
						<lb/> FLORUS, SYLLA.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>FLORUS thought it strange that Aristotle in his discourse
							of Drunkenness, affirming that old men are easily, women
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.269"/>
							
							hardly, overtaken, did not assign the cause, since he seldom
							failed on such occasions. He therefore proposed it to us
							(we were a great many acquaintance met at supper) as a
							fit subject for our enquiry. Sylla began: One part will
							conduce to the discovery of the other; and if we rightly
							hit the cause in relation to the women, the difficulty, as it
							concerns the old men, will be easily despatched; for their
							two natures are quite contrary. Moistness, smoothness,
							and softness belong to the one; and dryness, roughness,
							and hardness are the accidents of the other. As for
							women, I think the principal cause is the moistness of
							their temper; this produceth a softness in the flesh, a shining smoothness, and their usual purgations. Now when
							wine is mixed with a great deal of weak liquor, it is overpowered by that, loses its strength, and becomes flat and
							waterish. Some reason likewise may be drawn from Aristotle himself; for he affirms that those that drink fast, and
							take a large draught without drawing breath, are seldom
							overtaken, because the wine doth not stay long in their
							bodies, but having acquired an impetus by this greedy
							drinking, suddenly runs through; and women are generally observed to drink after that manner. Besides, it is
							probable that their bodies, by reason of the continual defluction of the moisture in order to their usual purgations,
							are very porous, and divided as it were into many little pipes
							and conduits; into which when the wine falls, it is quickly
							conveyed away, and doth not lie and fret the principal
							parts, from whose disturbance drunkenness proceeds. But
							that old men want the natural moisture, even the name
							<foreign lang="greek">ge/rontes</foreign>, in my opinion, intimates; for that name was given
							them not as inclining to the earth (<foreign lang="greek">r(e/ontes ei)s gh=n</foreign>), but as
							being in the habit of their body <foreign lang="greek">gew/deis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">gehroi/</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">earthlike</hi>
							and <hi rend="italics">earthy.</hi> Besides, the stiffness and roughness prove
							the dryness of their nature. Therefore it is probable that,
							when they drink, their body, being grown spongy by the
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.270"/>
							
							dryness of its nature, soaks up the wine, and that lying in
							the vessels it affects the senses and prevents the natural
							motions. For as floods of water glide over the close
							grounds, nor make them slabby, but quickly sink into the
							open and chapped fields; thus wine, being sucked in by
							the dry parts, lies and works in the bodies of old men.
							But besides, it is easy to observe, that age of itself hath
							all the symptoms of drunkenness. These symptoms every
							body knows; shaking of the joints, faltering of the tongue,
							babbling, passion, forgetfulness, and distraction of the
							mind; many of which being incident to old men, even
							whilst they are well and in perfect health, are heightened
							by any little irregularity and accidental debauch. So that
							drunkenness doth not beget in old men any new and proper
							symptoms, but only intend and increase the common ones.
							And an evident sign of this is, that nothing is so like an
							old man as a young man drunk.

                  <p>THUS Sylla said, and Apollonides the marshal subjoined: Sir, what you discoursed of old men I willingly
						admit; but in my opinion you have omitted a considerable
						reason in relation to the women, the coldness of their temper, which quencheth the heat of the strongest wine, and
						makes it lose all its destructive force and fire. This reflection seeming reasonable, Athryilatus the Thasian, a physician, kept us from a hasty conclusion in this matter, by
						saying that some supposed the female sex was not cold, but
						hotter than the male; and others thought wine rather cold
						than hot.</p>

                  <p>When Florus seemed surprised at this discourse,

						Athryliatus continued: Sir, what I mention about wine I
						shall leave to this man to make out (pointing to me, for a
						few days before we had handled the same matter). But
						that women are of a hot constitution, some suppose, may be
						proved, first, from their smoothness, for their heat wastes
						all the superfluous nourishment which breeds hair; secondly from their abundance of blood, which seems to be the
						fountain and source of all the heat that is in the body;&mdash;now this abounds so much in females, that they would be
						all on fire, unless relieved by frequent and sudden evacuations. Thirdly, from a usual practice of the sextons in
						burning the bodies of the (lead, it is evident that females
						are hotter than males; for the beds-men are wont to put
						one female body with ten males upon the same pile, for
						that contains some inflammable and oily parts, and serves
						for fuel to the rest. Besides, if that that is soonest fit for
						generation is hottest, and a maid begins to be furious sooner than a boy, this is a strong proof of the hotness of the
						female sex. But a more convincing proof follows: women
						endure cold better than men, they are not so sensible of
						the sharpness of the weather, and are contented with a
						few clothes.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>And Florus replied: Methinks, sir, from the same
						topics I could draw conclusions against your assertion.
						For, first, they endure cold better, because one similar
						quality doth not so readily act upon another; and then
						again, their seed is not active in generation, but passive
						matter and nourishment to that which the male injects.
						But more, women grow effete sooner than men; that they
						burn better than the males proceeds from their fat, which
						is the coldest part of the body; and young men, or such
						as use exercise, have but little fat. Their monthly purgations do not prove the abundance, but the corruption and
						badness, of their blood; for being the superfluous and undigested part, and having no convenient vessel in the body, it
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.272"/>
						
						flows out, and appears languid and feculent, by reason of
						the weakness of its heat. And the shivering that seizes
						them at the time of their purgations sufficiently proves
						that which flows from them is cold and undigested. And
						who will believe their smoothness to be an effect of heat
						rather than cold, when every body knows that the hottest
						parts of a man's body are the most hairy? For all such
						excrements are thrust out by the heat, which opens and
						makes passages through the skin; but smoothness is a consequent of that closeness of the superficies which proceeds
						from condensing cold. And that the flesh of women is
						closer than that of men, you may be informed by those that
						lie with women that have anointed themselves with oil or
						other perfumes; for though they do not touch the women,
						yet they find themselves perfumed, their bodies by reason
						of their heat and rarety drawing the odor to them. But I
						think we have disputed plausibly and sufficiently of this
						matter....

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>BUT now I would fain know upon what account you
						can imagine that wine is cold. Then, said I, do you believe this to be my opinion? Yes, said he, whose else?
						And I replied: I remember a good while ago I met with a
						discourse of Aristotle's upon this very question. And
						Epicurus, in his Banquet, hath a long discourse, the sum
						of which is that wine of itself is not hot, but that it contains some atoms that cause heat, and others that cause
						cold; now, when it is taken into the body, it loses one sort
						of particles and takes the other out of the body itself, according to the person's nature and constitution; so that some
						when they are drunk are very hot, and others very cold.</p>
                  <pb id="v.3.p.273"/>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>This way of talking, said Florus, leads us by Protagoras directly to Pyrrho; for it is evident that, suppose we
						were to discourse of oil, milk, honey, or the like, we shall
						avoid all enquiry into their particular natures, by saying
						that things are so and so by their mutual mixture with one
						another. But how do you prove that wine is cold? And I,
						being forced to speak extempore, replied: By two arguments. The first I draw from the practice of physicians,
						for when their patients' stomachs grow very weak, they
						prescribe no hot things, and yet give them wine as an excellent remedy. Besides, they stop looseness and immoderate sweating by wine; and this shows that they think it
						more binding and constipating than snow itself. Now if
						it were potentially hot, I should think it as wise a thing
						to apply fire to snow as wine to the stomach.</p>
                  <p>Again, most teach that sleep proceeds from the coolness
							of the parts; and most of the narcotic medicines, as mandrake and opium, are coolers. Those indeed work violently, and forcibly condense, but wine cools by degrees;
							it gently stops the motion, according as it hath more or
							less of such narcotic qualities. Besides, heat is generative; for owing to heat the moisture flows easily, and
							the vital spirit gains intensity and a stimulating force.
							Now the great drinkers are very dull, inactive fellows, no
							women's men at all; they eject nothing strong, vigorous,
							and fit for generation, but are weak and unperforming, by
							reason of the bad digestion and coldness of their seed.
							And it is farther observable that the effects of cold and
							drunkenness upon men's bodies are the same,&mdash;trembling,
							heaviness, paleness, shivering, faltering of tongue, numbness, and cramps. In many, a debauch ends in a dead
							palsy, when the wine stupefies and extinguisheth all the
							heat. And the physicians use this method in curing the
							qualms and diseases gotten by debauch; at night they
							cover them well and keep them warm; and at day they
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.274"/>
							
							anoint and bathe, and give them such food as shall not
							disturb, but by degrees recover the heat which the wine
							hath scattered and driven out of the body. Thus, I
							added, in these appearances we trace obscure qualities
							and powers; but as for drunkenness, it is easily discerned
							what it is. For, in my opinion, as I hinted before, those
							that are drunk are very much like old men; and therefore
							great drinkers grow old soonest, and they are commonly
							bald and gray before their time; and all these accidents
							certainly proceed from want of heat. But mere vinegar
							is of a vinous nature and strength, and nothing quenches
							fire so soon as that; its extreme coldness overcomes and
							kills the flame presently. And of all fruits physicians use
							the vinous as the greatest coolers, as pomegranates and
							apples. Besides, do they not make wine by mixing honey
							with rain-water or snow; for the cold, because those two
							qualities are near akin, if it prevails, changes the luscious
							into a poignant taste? And did not the ancients of all the
							creeping beasts consecrate the snake to Bacchus, and of
							all the plants the ivy, because they were of a cold and
							frozen nature? Now, lest any one should think this is an
							evidence of its heat, that if a man drinks juice of hemlock, a large dose of wine cures him, I shall on the contrary
							affirm that wine and hemlock juice mixed are an incurable
							poison, and kill him that drinks it presently. So that we
							can no more conclude it to be hot because it resists, than
							to be cold because it assists, the poison. For cold is the
							only quality by which hemlock juice works and kills.

						in Epicurus, said, that they had not duly weighed that
						piece; for he did not propose that question at first, and
						then discourse of that matter on purpose; but after supper he desired the young men to take a walk, and then
						discoursed upon it, that he might induce them to continence,
						and persuade them to abate their desires and restrain their
						appetites; showing them that it was very dangerous at all
						times, but especially after they had been eating or making
						merry. But suppose he had proposed this as the chief
						topic for discourse, doth it never become a philosopher to
						enquire which is the convenient and proper time? Ought
						we not to time it well, and direct our embrace by reason?
						Or may such discourses be otherwise allowed, and must
						they be thought unseemly problems to be proposed at
						table? Indeed I am of another mind. It is true, I should
						blame a philosopher that in the middle of the day, in the
						schools, before all sorts of men, should discourse of such
						a subject; but over a glass of wine between friends and
						acquaintance, when it is necessary to propose something
						beside dull serious discourse, why should it be a fault to
						hear or speak any thing that may inform our judgments or
						direct our practice in such matters? And I protest I had
						rather that Zeno had inserted his loose topics in some
						merry discourses and agreeable table-talk, than in such a
						grave, serious piece as his politics.</p>

						and the rest of the company desired Zopyrus to deliver
						Epicurus's sentiment. He said: The particulars I cannot
						remember; but I believe he feared the violent agitations of
						such exercises, because the bodies employed in them are
						so violently disturbed. For it is certain that wine is a very
						great disturber, and puts the body out of its usual temper;
						and therefore, when thus disquieted, if quiet and sleep do
						not compose it but other agitations seize it, it is likely that
						those parts which knit and join the members may be
						loosened, and the whole frame be as it were unsettled from
						its foundation and overthrown. For then likewise the seed
						cannot freely pass, but is confusedly and forcibly thrown
						out, because the liquor hath filled the vessels of the body,
						and stopped its way. Therefore, says Epicurus, we must
						use those sports when the body is at quiet, when the meat
						hath been thoroughly digested, carried about and applied
						to several parts of the body, but before we begin to want
						a fresh supply of food. To this of Epicurus we might
						join an argument taken from physic. At day time, while
						our digestion is performing, we are not so lusty nor eager
						to embrace; and presently after supper to endeavor it is
						dangerous, for the crudity of the stomach, the food being
						yet undigested, may be increased by a disorderly motion
						upon this crudity, and so the mischief be double.</p>

							Epicurus does well, when contrary to all right and equity
							he separates Venus and the Night, though Menander, a
							man well skilled in love matters, says that she likes her
							company better than that of any of the Gods. For, in my
							opinion, night is a very convenient veil, spread over those
							that give themselves to that kind of pleasure; for it is not
							fit that day should be the time, lest modesty should be
							banished from our eyes, effeminacy grow bold, and such
							vigorous impressions on our memories be left, as might still
							possess us with the same fancies and raise new inclinations.
							For the sight (according to Plato) receives a more vigorous
							impression than any other bodily organ, and joining with
							imagination, that lies near it, works presently upon the
							soul, and ever raises a new and fresh desire by those
							images of pleasure which it brings. But the night, hiding
							many and the most furious of the actions, quiets and lulls
							nature, and doth not suffer it to be carried to intemperance
							by the eye. But besides this, how absurd is it, that a man
							returning from an entertainment, merry perhaps and jocund, crowned and perfumed, should cover himself up,
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.278"/>
							
							turn his back to his wife, and go to sleep; and then at

							her apartment to come to him for such a matter; or in the
							morning, as a cock treads his hens. No, sir, the evening
							is the end of our labor, and the morning the beginning.
							Bacchus the Loosener and Terpsichore and Thalia preside
							over the former; and the latter raiseth us up betimes to
							attend on Minerva the Work-mistress, and Mercury the
							merchandiser. And therefore songs, dances, and epithalamiums, merry-meetings, with balls and feasts, and sounds
							of pipes and flutes, are the entertainment of the one; but
							in the other, nothing but the noise of hammers and anvils,
							the scratching of saws, the morning cries of noisy tax-gatherers, citations to court or to attend this or that prince
							and magistrate, are heard.

                  <p>AT Athens on the eleventh day of February (thence
						called <foreign lang="greek">*piqoi/gia</foreign>, (<hi rend="italics">the barrel-opening</hi>), they began to taste their
						new wine; and in old times (as it appears), before they
						drank, they offered some to the Gods, and prayed that that

						Thebans the month is named <foreign lang="greek">*prostath/rios</foreign>, and it is our custom upon the sixth day to sacrifice to our good Genius

						and the liquor that can bear this fermentation is of a strong
						body and will keep well. My father offered the usual sacrifice, and when after supper the young men, my fellow-students, commended the wine, he started this question:
						Why does not new wine inebriate as soon as other? This
						seemed a paradox and incredible to most of us; but Hagias said, that luscious things were cloying and would
						presently satiate, and therefore few could drink enough to
						make them drunk; for when once the thirst is allayed, the
						appetite would be quickly palled by that unpleasant liquor;
						for that a luscious is different from a sweet taste, even the
						poet intimates, when he says,

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>WELL then, said my father, since we have fallen
						upon Aristotle, I will endeavor to propose something of
						my own concerning those that are half drunk; for, in my
						mind, though he was a very acute man, he is not accurate
						enough in such matters. They usually say, I think, that a
						sober man's understanding apprehends things right and
						judges well; the sense of one quite drunk is weak and
						enfeebled; but of them that are half drunk the fancy is
						vigorous and the understanding weakened, and therefore,
						following their own fancies, they judge, but judge ill.
						But pray, sirs, what is your opinion in these matters?</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>This reason, I replied, would satisfy me upon a
						private disquisition; but if you will have my own sentiments, let us first consider, whether this difference doth
						not proceed from the different temper of the body. For
						of those that are only half drunk, the mind alone is disturbed, but the body not being quite overwhelmed is yet
						able to obey its motions; but when it is too much oppressed
						and the wine has overpowered it, it betrays and frustrates
						the motions of the mind, for men in such a condition never
						go so far as action. But those that are half drunk, having
						a body serviceable to the absurd motions of the mind, are
						rather to be thought to have greater ability to comply with
						those they have, than to have worse inclinations than the
						others. Now if, proceeding on another principle, we consider the strength of the wine itself, nothing hinders but
						that this may be different and changeable, according to the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.282"/>
						
						quantity that is drunk. As fire, when moderate, hardens
						a piece of clay, but if very strong, makes it brittle and
						crumble into pieces; and the heat of the spring fires our
						blood with fevers, but as the summer comes on. the disease
						usually abates; what hinders then but that the mind, being naturally raised by the power of the wine, when it is
						come to a pitch, should by pouring on more be weakened
						again, and its force abated? Thus hellebore, before it
						purges, disturbs the body; but if too small a dose be given,
						it disturbs only and purges not at all; and some taking too
						little of an opiate are more restless than before; and some
						taking too much sleep well. Besides, it is probable that
						this disturbance into which those that are half drunk are put,
						when it comes to a pitch, conduces to that decay. For a great
						quantity being taken inflames the body and consumes the
						frenzy of the mind; as a mournful song and melancholy
						music at a funeral raises grief at first and forces tears, but
						as it continues, by little and little it takes away all dismal
						apprehensions and consumes our sorrows. Thus wine,
						after it hath heated and disturbed, calms the mind again
						and quiets the frenzy; and when men are dead drunk,
						their passions are at rest.

						but if strong, dry the flesh; and that from these considerations an answer to the question might be easily deduced.
						For the moon gently warming makes the body moist; but

						moisture from them. Thus Archilochus spoke like a naturalist,

                  <p>When he had done, I said: The rest of the discourse
						I like very well, but I cannot consent when you ascribe
						this effect to the strength and degree of heat, and chiefly
						in the hot seasons; for in winter every one knows that the
						sun warms little, yet in summer it putrefies most. Now
						the contrary should happen, if the gentleness of the heat
						were the cause of putrefaction. And besides, the hotter
						the season is, so much the sooner meat stinks; and therefore this effect is not to be ascribed to the want of heat in
						the moon, but to some particular proper quality in her
						beams. For heat is not different only by degrees; but in
						fires there are some proper qualities very much unlike one
						another, as a thousand obvious instances will prove. Goldsmiths heat their gold in chaff fires; physicians use fires
						of vine-twigs in their distillations; and tamarisk is the
						best fuel for a glass-house. Olive-boughs in a vapor-bath
						warm very well, but hurt other baths: they spoil the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.286"/>
						
						timbers, and weaken the foundation; and therefore the
						most skilful of the public officers forbid those that rent
						the baths to burn olive-tree wood, or throw darnel seed
						into the fire, because the fumes of it dizzy and bring the
						headache to those that bathe. Therefore it is no wonder
						that the moon differs in her qualities from the sun; and
						that the sun should shed some drying, and the moon some
						dissolving, influence upon flesh. And upon this account
						it is that nurses are very cautious of exposing their infants
						to the beams of the moon; for they being full of moisture,
						as green plants, are easily wrested and distorted. And
						everybody knows that those that sleep abroad under the
						beams of the moon are not easily waked, but seem stupid
						and senseless; for the moisture that the moon sheds upon
						them oppresses their faculty and disables their bodies.
						Besides, it is commonly said, that women brought to bed
						when the moon is a fortnight old, have easy labors; and
						for this reason I believe that Diana, which was the same
						with the moon, was called the goddess of childbirth. And

							will be leavened sooner in the full, for then, though the
							leaven is scarce proportioned to the meal, yet it rarefies
							and leavens the whole lump. Now when flesh putrefies,

                  <p>Thus a thousand instances do prove that the light of the
							moon is moist, and carries with it a softening and corrupting quality. Now the brazen nail that is driven through
							the flesh, if, as they say, it keeps the flesh from putrefying,
							doth it by an astringent quality proper to the brass. The
							rust of brass physicians use in astringent medicines, and
							they say those that dig brass ore have been cured of a rheum
							in their eyes, and that the hair upon their eyelids hath
							grown again; for the dust rising from the ore, being insensibly applied to the eyes, stops the rheum and dries up
							the humor. Upon this account, perhaps, Homer calls brass
							<foreign lang="greek">eu)h/nwr</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">nw=roy</foreign>. Aristotle says, that wounds made by a
							brazen dart or a brazen sword are less painful and sooner
							cured than those that are made of iron weapons, because
							brass hath something medicinal in itself, which in the very
							instant is applied to the wound. Now it is manifest that
							astringents are contrary to putrefying, and healing to corrupting qualities. Some perhaps may say, that the nail
							driven through draws all the moisture to itself, for the
							humor still flows to the part that is hurt; and therefore it
							is said that by the nail there always appears some speck
							and tumor; and therefore it is rational that the other parts
							should remain sound, when all the corruption gathers
							about that.</p>

                  <p>Polybius, my Sossius Senecio, advised Scipio Africanus
						never to return from the Forum, where he was conversant
						about the affairs of the city, before he had gained one new
						friend. Where I suppose the word friend is not to be
						taken too nicely, to signify a lasting and unchangeable acquaintance; but, as it vulgarly means, a well-wisher, and as
						Dicearchus takes it, when he says that we should endeavor
						to make all men well-wishers, but only good men friends.
						For friendship is to be acquired by time and virtue; but
						good-will is produced by a familiar intercourse, or by mirth
						and trifling amongst civil and genteel men, especially if
						opportunity assists their natural inclinations to good-nature.
						But consider whether this advice may not be accommodated to an entertainment as well as the Forum; so that we
						should not break up the meeting before we had gained one
						of the company to be a well-wisher and a friend. Other
						occasions draw men into the Forum, but men of sense come
						to an entertainment as well to get new friends as to make
						their old ones merry; indeed to carry away any thing else
						is sordid and uncivil, but to depart with one friend more
						than we had is pleasing and commendable. And so, on
						the contrary, he that doth not aim at this renders the meeting useless and unpleasant to himself, and departs at last,
						having been a partaker of an entertainment with his belly
						but not with his mind. For he that makes one at a feast
						doth not come only to enjoy the meat and drink, but likewise the discourse, mirth, and genteel humor which ends
						at last in friendship and good-will. The wrestlers, that
						they may hold fast and lock better, use dust; and so wine
						mixed with discourse is of extraordinary use to make us
						hold fast of, and fasten upon, a friend. For wine tempered with discourse carries gentle and kind affections out
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.289"/>
						
						of the body into the mind; otherwise, it is scattered
						through the limbs, and serves only to swell and disturb.
						Thus as a marble, by cooling red-hot iron, takes away its
						softness and makes it hard, fit to be wrought and receive
						impression; thus discourse at an entertainment doth not
						permit the men that are engaged to become altogether
						liquid by the wine, but confines and makes their jocund
						and obliging tempers very fit to receive an impression
						from the seal of friendship if dexterously applied.</p>

               <head>Question I.
						<lb/> WHETHER DIFFERENT SORTS OF FOOD, OR ONE SINGLE DISH FED UPON AT ONCE, IS MORE EASILY DIGESTED.
						<lb/> PHILO. PLUTARCH, MARCION.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THE first question of my fourth decade of Table Discourses shall be concerning different sorts of food eaten at
						one meal. When we came to Hyampolis at the feast
						called Elaphebolia, Philo the physician gave us a very
						sumptuous entertainment; and seeing some boys who came
						with Philinus feeding upon dry bread and calling for
						nothing else, he cried out, O Hercules, well I see the
						proverb is verified,
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">They fought midst stones, but could not take up one,</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>and presently went out to fetch them some agreeable food.
							He staid some time, and at last brought them dried figs
							and cheese; upon which I said: It is usually seen that
							those that provide costly and superfluous dainties neglect,
							or are not well furnished with, useful and necessary things.
							I protest, said Philo, I did not mind that Philinus designs
							to breed us a young Sosastrus, who (they say) never all his
							lifetime drank or ate any thing beside milk, although it
							is probable that it was some change in his constitution that
							made him use this sort of diet; but our Chiron here,&mdash;
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.290"/>
							
							quite contrary to the old one that bred Achilles from his
							very birth,&mdash;feeding his son with unbloody food, gives
							people reason to suspect that like a grasshopper he keeps
							him on dew and air. Indeed, said Philinus, I did not know
							that we were to meet with a supper of a hundred beasts,
							such as Aristomenes made for his friends; otherwise I had
							come with some poor and wholesome food about me, as a
							specific against such costly and unwholesome entertainments. For I have often heard that simple diet is not only
							more easily provided, but likewise more easily digested,
							than such variety. At this Marcion said to Philo: Philinus
							hath spoiled your whole provision by deterring the guests
							from eating; but, if you desire it, I will be surety for you,
							that such variety is more easily digested than simple food,
							so that without fear or distrust they may feed heartily.
							Philo desired him to do so.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>When after supper we begged Philinus to discover
						what he had to urge against variety of food, he thus began: I am not the author of this opinion, but our friend
						Philo here is ever now and then telling us, first, that wild
						beasts, feeding on one sort only and simple diet, are much
						more healthy than men are; and that those which are
						kept in pens are much more subject to diseases and crudities, by reason of the prepared variety we usually give
						them. Secondly, no physician is so daring, so venturous
						at new experiments, as to give a feverish patient different
						sorts of food at once. No, simple food, and without
						sauce, as more easy to be digested, is the only diet they
						allow. Now food must be wrought on and altered by our
						natural powers; in dyeing, cloth of the most simple color
						takes the tincture soonest; the most inodorous oil is soonest by perfumes changed into an essence; and simple diet
						is soonest changed, and soonest yields to the digesting
						power. For many and different qualities, having some
						contrariety, when they meet disagree and corrupt one another;
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.291"/>
						
						 as in a city, a mixed rout are not easily reduced
						into one body, nor brought to follow the same concerns;
						for each works according to its own nature, and is very
						hardly brought to side with another's quality. Now this
						is evident in wine; mixed wine inebriates very soon, and
						drunkenness is much like a crudity rising from undigested
						wine; and therefore the drinkers hate mixed liquors, and
						those that do mix them do it privately, as afraid to have
						their design upon the company discovered. Every change
						is disturbing and injurious, and therefore musicians are
						very careful how they strike many strings at once; though
						the mixture and variety of the notes would be the only
						harm that would follow. This I dare say, that belief and
						assent can be sooner procured by disagreeing arguments,
						than concoction by various and different qualities. But
						lest I should seem jocose, waving this, I will return to
						Philo's observations again. We have often heard him declare that it is the quality that makes meat hard to be
						digested; that to mix many things together is hurtful, and
						begets unnatural qualities; and that every man should take
						that which by experience he finds most agreeable to his
						temper.</p>
                  <p>Now if nothing is by its own nature hard to be digested,
							but it is the quantity that disturbs and corrupts, I think
							we have still greater reason to forbear that variety with
							which Philo's cook, as it were in opposition to his master's
							practice, would draw us on to surfeits and diseases. For,
							by the different sorts of food and new ways of dressing, he
							still keeps up the unwearied appetite, and leads it from one
							dish to another, till tasting of every thing we take more
							than is sufficient and enough; as Hypsipyle's foster-child,

							ear, or touch; for it still proposeth new provocatives; but
							in simple pleasures, and such as are confined to one sort,

							variety of dishes; for certainly such changes and turnings
							as must necessarily ensue will force us out of the right
							way of health.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Philinus having ended his discourse, Marcion said:
						In my opinion, not only those that separate profit from
						honesty are obnoxious to Socrates's curse, but those also
						that separate pleasure from health, as if it were its enemy
						and opposite, and not its great friend and promoter. Pain
						we use but seldom and unwillingly, as the most violent
						instrument. But from all things else, none, though he
						would willingly, can remove pleasure. It still attends
						when we eat, sleep, bathe, or anoint, and takes care of and
						nurses the diseased; dissipating all that is hurtful and disagreeable, by applying that which is proper, pleasing, and
						natural. For what pain, what want, what poison so quickly
						and so easily cures a disease as seasonable bathing? A
						glass of wine, when a man wants it, or a dish of palatable
						meat, presently frees us from all disturbing particles, and
						settles nature in its proper state, there being as it were a
						calm and serenity spread over the troubled humors. But
						those remedies that are painful do hardly and only by little
						and little promote the cure, every difficulty pushing on and
						forcing Nature. And therefore let not Philinus blame us,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.293"/>
						
						if we do not make all the sail we can to fly from pleasure,
						but more diligently endeavor to make pleasure and health,
						than other philosophers do to make pleasure and honesty,
						agree. Now, in my opinion, Philinus, you seem to be out
						in your first argument, where you suppose the beasts use
						more simple food and are more healthy than men; neither
						of which is true. The first the goats in Eupolis confute,
						for they extol their pasture as full of variety and all sorts
						of herbs, in this manner,

                           <l>Wild olives, thyme,&mdash;all freely yield their store.</l>

                  <p>These that I have mentioned are very different in taste,
							smell, and other qualities, and he reckons more sorts which
							I have omitted. The second Homer skilfully refutes, when
							he tells us that the plague first began amongst the beasts.
							Besides, the shortness of their lives proves that they are
							very subject to diseases; for there is scarce any irrational
							creature long lived, besides the crow and the chough; and
							those two every one knows do not confine themselves to
							simple food, but eat any thing. Besides, you take no good
							rule to judge what is easy and what is hard of digestion
							from the diet of those that are sick; for labor and exercise,
							and even to chew our meat well, contribute very much to
							digestion, neither of which can agree with a man in a
							fever. Again, that the variety of meats, by reason of the
							different qualities of the particulars, should disagree and
							spoil one another, you have no reason to fear. For if
							Nature chooses from dissimilar bodies what is fit and agree
							able, the diverse nourishment transmits many and sundry
							qualities into the mass and bulk of the body, applying to
							every part that which is meet and fit; so that, as Empedocles words it,
							
							<quote rend="blockquote">

                  <pb id="v.3.p.294"/>
                  <p>and after the mixture is spread through the mass by the
							heat which is in the spirit, the proper parts are separated
							and applied to the proper members. Indeed, it is very
							probable that such bodies as ours, consisting of parts of
							different natures, should be nourished and built up rather
							of various than of simple matter. But if by concoction
							there is an alteration made in the food, this will be more
							easily performed when there are different sorts of meat,
							than when there is only one, in the stomach; for similars
							cannot work upon similars, and the very contrariety in the
							mixture considerably promotes the alteration of the enfeebled qualities. But if, Philinus, you are against all
							mixture, do not chide Philo only for the variety of his
							dishes and sauces, but also for using mixture in his sovereign antidotes, which Erasistratus calls the Gods' hands.
							Convince him of absurdity and vanity, when he mixes
							things vegetable, mineral, and animal, and things from
							sea and land, in one potion; and advise him to let these
							alone, and to confine all physic to barley-broth, gourds, and
							oil mixed with water. But you urge farther, that variety
							enticeth the appetite that hath no command over itself.
							That is, good sir, cleanly, wholesome, sweet, palatable,
							pleasing diet makes us eat and drink more than ordinary.
							Why then, instead of fine flour, do not we thicken our
							broth with coarse bran? And instead of asparagus, why
							do we not dress nettle-tops and thistles; and leaving this
							fragrant and pleasant wine, drink sour harsh liquor that
							gnats have been buzzing about a long while? Because,
							perhaps you may reply, wholesome feeding doth not consist in a perfect avoiding of all that is pleasing, but in
							moderating the appetite in that respect, and making it
							prefer profit before pleasure. But, sir, as a mariner has a
							thousand ways to avoid a stiff gale of wind, but when it is
							clear down and a perfect calm, cannot raise it again; thus
							to correct and restrain our extravagant appetite is no hard
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.295"/>
							
							matter, but when it grows weak and faint, when it fails as
							to its proper objects, then to raise it and make it vigorous
							and active again is, sir, a very difficult and hard task. And
							therefore variety of viands is as much better than simple
							food, which is apt to satisfy by being but of one sort, as it
							is easier to stop Nature when she makes too much speed,
							than to force her on when languishing and faint. Beside,
							what some say, that fulness is more to be avoided than
							emptiness, is not true; but, on the contrary, fulness then
							only hurts when it ends in a surfeit or disease; but emptiness, though it doth no other mischief, is of itself unnatural. And let this suffice as an answer to what you
							proposed. But you who stick to salt and cummin have
							forgot, that variety is sweeter and more desired by the
							appetite, unless too sweet. For, the sight preparing the
							way, it is soon assimilated to the eager receiving body; but
							that which is not desirable Nature either throws off again,
							or keeps it in for mere want. But pray observe this, that
							I do not plead for variety in tarts, cakes, or sauces;&mdash;those
							are vain, insignificant, and superfluous things;&mdash;but even
							Plato allowed variety to those fine citizens of his, setting
							before them onions, olives, leeks, cheese, and all sorts
							of meat and fish, and besides these, allowed them some
							dried fruits.

               <head>Question II.
						<lb/> WHY MUSHROOMS ARE THOUGHT TO BE PRODUCED BY THUNDER, AND WHY IT IS BELIEVED THAT MEN ASLEEP ARE NEVER THUNDERSTRUCK.
						<lb/> AGEMACHUS, PLUTARCH, DOROTHEUS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AT a supper in Elis, Agemachus set before us very
						large mushrooms. And when all admired at them, one
						with a smile said, These are worthy the late thunder,
						as it were deriding those who imagine mushrooms are produced
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.296"/>
						
						 by thunder. Some said that thunder did split the
						earth, using the air as a wedge for that purpose, and that by
						those chinks those that sought after mushrooms were directed where to find them; and thence it grew a common
						opinion, that thunder engenders mushrooms, and not only
						makes them a passage to appear; as if one should imagine
						that a shower of rain breeds snails, and not rather makes
						them creep forth and be seen abroad. Agemachus stood
						up stiffly for the received opinion, and told us, we should
						not disbelieve it only because it was strange, for there are
						a thousand other effects of thunder and lightning and a
						thousand omens deduced from them, whose causes it is
						very hard, if not impossible, to discover; for this laughed-at, this proverbial mushroom doth not escape the thunder
						because it is so little, but because it hath some antipathetical qualities that preserve it from blasting; as likewise a fig-tree, the skin of a sea-calf (as they say), and that of the
						hyena, with which sailors cover the ends of their sails.
						And husbandmen call thunder-showers fertilizing, and
						think them to be so. Indeed, it is absurd to wonder at
						these things, when we see the most incredible things imaginable in thunder, as flame rising out of moist vapors,
						and from soft clouds such astonishing noises. Thus, he
						continued, I prattle, exhorting you to enquire after the
						cause; and I shall accept this as your club for these
						mushrooms.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Then I began: Agemachus himself helps us exceedingly toward this discovery; for nothing at the present seems more probable than that, together with the
						thunder, oftentimes generative waters fall, which receive
						that quality from the heat mixed with them. For the
						piercing pure parts of the fire break away in lightning;
						but the grosser flatulent part, being wrapped up in the cloud,
						changes its nature, taking away the coldness and rendering
						the moisture mild and gentle, and altering and being altered
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.297"/>
						
						with it, warms it so that it is made fit to enter the pores of
						plants, and is easily assimilated to them. Besides, such rain
						gives those things which it waters a peculiar temperature
						and difference of juice. Thus dew makes the grass sweeter
						to the sheep, and the clouds from which a rainbow is reflected make those trees on which they fall fragrant. And
						our priests, distinguishing it by this, call the wood of those
						trees rainbow-struck, imagining that Iris, or the rainbow,
						hath rested on them. Now it is probable that when these
						thunder and lightning showers with a great deal of warmth
						and spirit descend forcibly into the caverns of the earth,
						the ground is moved thereby, and knobs and tumors are
						formed like those produced by heat and noxious humors
						in our bodies, which we call wens or kernels. For a
						mushroom is not like a plant, neither is it produced without rain; it hath no root nor sprouts, it depends on nothing,
						but is a being by itself, having the consistence only of the
						earth, which hath been a little changed and altered. If
						this discourse seems frivolous, I assure you that such are
						most of the effects of thunder and lightning which we
						see; and upon that account men think them to be immediately directed by Heaven, and not depending on natural
						causes.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Dorotheus the rhetorician, one of our company, said:
						You speak right, sir, for not only the vulgar and illiterate,
						but even some of the philosophers, have been of that
						opinion. I remember here in this town lightning broke
						into a house, and did a great many strange things. It let
						the wine out of a vessel, though the earthen vessel remained
						whole; and falling upon a man asleep, it neither hurt him
						nor blasted his clothes, but melted certain pieces of money
						that he had in his pocket, defaced them quite, and made
						them run into a lump. Upon this he went to a philosopher, a Pythagorean, that sojourned in the town, and asked
						the reason; the philosopher directed him to some expiating
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.298"/>
						
						rites, and advised him to consider seriously with himself,
						and go to prayers. And I have been told, that lightning
						falling upon a sentinel at Rome, as he stood to guard the
						temple, burned the latchet of his shoe, and did no other
						harm; and several silver candlesticks lying in wooden
						boxes, the silver was melted while the boxes lay untouched. These stories you may believe or not as you
						please. But that which is most wonderful, and which
						everybody knows, is this,&mdash;the bodies of those that are
						killed by lightning never putrefy. For many neither burn
						nor bury such bodies, but let them lie above ground with a
						fence about them, so that every one may see they remain
						uncorrupted, confuting by this Euripides's Clymene, who

                  <p>And when I put in my advice, saying that it was as
						seasonable to discourse of thunder and lightning amidst
						our cups as it would be in a comedy to bring in engines to
						throw out lightning, the company agreed to set aside all
						other questions relating to the subject, and desired me only
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.299"/>
						
						to proceed on this head, Why are men asleep never blasted
						with lightning? And I, though I knew I should get no
						great credit by proposing a cause whose reason was common to other things, said thus: Lightning is wonderfully
						piercing and subtile, partly because it rises from a very
						pure substance, and partly because by the swiftness of its
						motion it purges itself and throws off all gross earthy particles that are mixed with it. Nothing, says Democritus,
						is blasted with lightning, that cannot resist and stop the
						motion of the pure flame. Thus the close bodies, as brass,
						silver, and the like, which stop it, feel its force and are
						melted, because they resist; whilst rare, thin bodies, and
						such as are full of pores, are passed through and not hurted,
						as clothes or dry wood. It blasts green wood or grass, the
						moisture within them being seized and kindled by the
						flame. Now, if it is true that men asleep are never killed
						by lightning, from what we have proposed, and not from
						any thing else, we must endeavor to draw the cause. Now
						the bodies of those that are awake are stiffer and more
						apt to resist, all the parts being full of spirits; which as it
						were in a harp, distending and screwing up the organs of
						sense, makes the body of the animal firm, close, and compacted. But when men are asleep, the organs are let
						down, and the body becomes rare, lax, and loose; and the
						spirits failing, it hath abundance of pores, through which
						small sounds and smells do flow insensibly. For in that
						case, there is nothing that can resist, and by this resistance
						receive any sensible impression from any objects that are
						presented, much less from such as are so subtile and move
						so swiftly as lightning. Things that are weak Nature
						shields from harm, fencing them about with some hard
						thick covering; but those things that cannot be resisted
						do less harm to the bodies that yield than to those that
						oppose their force. Besides, those that are asleep are not
						startled at the thunder; they have no consternation upon
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.300"/>
						
						them, which kills a great many that are no otherwise hurt,
						and we know that thousands die with the very fear of
						being killed. Even shepherds teach their sheep to run
						together into a flock when it thunders, for whilst they lie
						scattered they die with fear; and we see thousands fall,
						which have no marks of any stroke or fire about them,
						their souls (as it seems), like birds, flying out of their bodies
						at the fright. For many, as Euripides says,
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">A clap hath killed, yet ne'er drew drop of blood.</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>For certainly the hearing is a sense that is soonest and
							most vigorously wrought upon, and the fear that is caused
							by any astonishing noise raiseth the greatest commotion
							and disturbance in the body; from all which men asleep,
							because insensible, are secure. But those that are awake
							are oftentimes killed with fear before they are touched;
							and fear contracts and condenses the body, so that the
							stroke must be strong, because there is so considerable a
							resistance.

                  <p>AT my son Autobulus's marriage, Sossius Senecio from

						more guests are usually invited than to any other. Nay
						even those law-givers that chiefly opposed luxury and profuseness have particularly confined marriage feasts to a set
						number. Indeed, in my opinion, he continued, Hecataeus
						the Abderite, one of the old philosophers, hath said nothing to the purpose in this matter, when he tells us that
						those that marry wives invite a great many to the entertainment, that many may see and be witnesses that they

						being free born take to themselves wives of the same condition. For, on the contrary, the comedians reflect on

						the house with dishes, . . .

						others give, only because I have none of my own to produce, continued he, I begin by declaring that there is no
						such evident or public notice given of any feast as there
						is of one at a marriage. For when we sacrifice to the
						Gods, when we take leave of or receive a friend, a great
						many of our acquaintance need not know it. But a marriage dinner is proclaimed by the loud sound of the wedding song, by the torches and the music, which as Homer

						something more considerable, and that is this; since by
						this marriage two families join in one, the man thinks it
						his duty to be civil and obliging to the woman's friends,
						and the woman's friends think themselves obliged to return
						the same to him and his; and upon this account the company

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AEDEPSUS in Euboea, where the baths are, is a place
						by nature every way fitted for free and gentle pleasures, and
						withal so beautified with stately edifices and dining rooms,

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Several times at these public meetings divers agreeable discourses were raised; and it fell out that once a
						very splendid treat, adorned with variety of dainties, gave
						occasion for enquiries concerning food, whether the land or
						sea yielded better. Here when a great part of the company were highly commending the land, as abounding
						with many choice, nay, an infinite variety of all sorts of
						creatures, Polycrates calling to Symmachus, said to him:
						But you, sir, being an animal bred between two seas, and
						brought up among so many which surround your sacred
						Nicopolis, will not you stand up for Neptune? Yes, I
						will, replied Symmachus, and therefore command you to
						stand by me, who enjoy the most pleasant part of all the
						Achaean Sea. Well, says Polycrates, the beginning of my
						discourse shall be grounded upon custom ; for as of a great
						number of poets we usually give one, who far excels the
						rest, the famous name of poet; so though there be many
						sorts of dainties, yet custom has so prevailed, that the fish
						alone, or above all the rest, is called <foreign lang="greek">o)/yon</foreign>, because it is more
						excellent than all others. For we do not call those gluttonous and great eaters who love beef, as Hercules, who
						after flesh used to eat green figs; nor those that love figs,
						as Plato; nor lastly, those that are for grapes, as Arcesilaus; but those who frequent the fish-market, and soonest
						hear the market-bell. Thus when Demosthenes told Philocrates that the gold he got by treachery was spent upon
						whores and fish, he upbraids him as a gluttonous and lascivious fellow. And Ctesiphon said pat enough, when a
						certain glutton cried aloud in the Senate that he should burst
						asunder: No, by no means let us be baits for your fish!
						And what was his meaning, do you think, who made this
						verse,
						<quote rend="blockquote">You capers gnaw, when you may sturgeon eat?</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what, for God's sake, do those men mean who, inviting

							<pb id="v.3.p.304"/>
							
							we will dine upon the shore? Is it not that they suppose,
							what is certainly true, that a dinner upon the shore is of
							all others most delicious? Not by reason of the waves and
							stones in that place,&mdash;for who upon the sea-coast would
							be content to feed upon a pulse or a caper?&mdash;but because
							their table is furnished with plenty of fresh fish. Add to
							this, that sea-food is dearer than any other. Wherefore
							Cato, inveighing against the luxury of the city, did not
							exceed the bounds of truth, when he said that at Rome a
							fish was sold for more than an ox. For they sell a small
							pot of fish for a price which a hecatomb of sheep with an
							ox would hardly bring. Besides, as the physician is the
							best judge of physic, and the musician of songs; so he is
							able to give the best account of the goodness of meat who
							is the greatest lover of it. For I will not make Pythagoras
							and Xenocrates arbitrators in this case; but Antagoras the
							poet, and Philoxenus the son of Eryxis, and Androcydes
							the painter, of whom it was reported that, when he drew a
							landscape of Scylla, he drew fish in a lively manner swimming round her, because he was a great lover of them.
							So Antigonus the king, surprising Antagoras the poet in
							the habit of a cook, broiling congers in his tent, said to
							him: Dost thou think that Homer was dressing congers
							when he writ Agamemnon's famous exploits? And he as
							smartly replied: Do you think that Agamemnon did so
							many famous exploits when he was enquiring who dressed
							congers in the camp? These arguments, says Polycrates,
							I have urged in behalf of fishmongers, drawing them from
							testimony and custom.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>But, says Symmachus, I will go more seriously to
						work, and more like a logician. For if that may truly be
						said to be a dainty which gives meat the best relish, it will
						evidently follow, that that is the best sort of dainty which
						gets men the best stomach to their meat. Therefore, as
						those philosophers who were called Elpistics (from the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.305"/>
						
						Greek word signifying hope, which above all others they
						cried up) averred that there was nothing in the world
						which concurred more to the preservation of life than
						hope, without whose gracious influence life would be a
						burden and altogether intolerable; in the like manner
						that of all things may be said to get us a stomach to our
						meat, without which all meat would be unpalatable and
						nauseous. And among all those things the earth yields,
						we find no such things as salt, which we can have only
						from the sea. First of all, there would be nothing eatable
						without salt, which mixed with flour seasons bread also.
						Hence it was that Neptune and Ceres had both the same
						temple. Besides, salt is the most pleasant of all relishes.
						For those heroes who, like champions, used themselves to
						a spare diet, banishing from their tables all vain and superfluous delicacies, to such a degree that when they encamped by the Hellespont they abstained from fish, yet for
						all this could not eat flesh without salt; which is a sufficient evidence that salt is the most desirable of all relishes.
						For as colors need light, so tastes need salt, that they may
						affect the sense, unless you would have them very nauseous
						and unpleasant. For, as Heraclitus used to say, a carcass
						is more abominable than dung. Now all flesh is dead, and
						part of a lifeless carcass; but the virtue of salt, being
						added to it, like a soul, gives it a pleasing relish and
						poignancy. Hence it comes to pass that before meat men
						use to take sharp things, and such as have much salt in
						them; for these beguile us into an appetite. And whoever has his stomach sharpened with these sets cheerfully
						and freshly upon all other sorts of meat. But if he begin
						with any other kind of food, all on a sudden his stomach
						grows dull and languid. And therefore salt doth not only
						make meat but drink palatable. For Homer's onion,
						which, he tells us, they were used to eat before they drank,
						was fitter for seamen and boatmen than kings. Things
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.306"/>
						
						moderately salt, by being agreeable to the mouth, make all
						sorts of wine mild and palatable, and water itself of a
						pleasing taste. Besides, salt creates none of those troubles
						which an onion does, but digests all other kinds of meat,
						making them tender and fitter for concoction; so that at
						the same time it is sauce to the palate and physic to the
						body. But all other sea-food, besides this pleasantness, is
						also very innocent; for though it be fleshly, yet it does not
						load the stomach as all other flesh does, but is easily concocted and digested. This Zeno will' avouch for me, and
						Crato too, who confine sick persons to a fish diet, as of all
						others the lightest sort of meat. And it stands with reason,
						that the sea should produce the most nourishing and wholesome food, seeing it yields us the most refined, the purest,
						and therefore the most agreeable air.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>You say right, says Lamprias, but let us think of something else to confirm what you have spoken. I remember
						my old grandfather was used to say in derision of the Jews,
						that they abstained from most lawful flesh; but we will
						say that that is most lawful meat which comes from the sea.
						For we can claim no great right over land creatures, which
						are nourished with the same food, draw the same air, wash
						in and drink the same water, that we do ourselves; and
						when they are slaughtered, they make us ashamed of what
						we are doing, with their hideous cries; and then again,
						by living amongst us, they arrive at some degree of familiarity and intimacy with us. But sea creatures are altogether strangers to us, and are born and brought up as it
						were in another world; neither does their voice, look, or
						any service they have done us plead for their life. For
						this kind of creatures are of no use at all to us, nor is
						there any necessity that we should love them. But that
						place which we inhabit is hell to them, and as soon as ever
						they enter upon it they die.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AFTER these things were spoken, and some in the

						for that is a thing I very much question, whether it was
						that the Jews abstained from swine's flesh because they
						conferred divine honor upon that creature, or because they
						had a natural aversion to it. For whatever we find in
						their own writings seems to be altogether fabulous, except
						they have some more solid reasons which they have no
						mind to discover.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Hence it is, says Callistratus, that I am of an opinion
						that this nation has that creature in some veneration; and
						though it be granted that the hog is an ugly and filthy
						creature, yet it is not quite so vile nor naturally stupid as a
						beetle, griffin, crocodile, or cat, most of which are worshipped as the most sacred things by some priests amongst
						the Egyptians. But the reason why the hog is had in so
						much honor and veneration amongst them is, because, as
						the report goes, that creature breaking up the earth with
						its snout showed the way to tillage, and taught them how
						to use the ploughshare, which instrument for that very
						reason, as some say, was called <hi rend="italics">hynis</hi> from <foreign lang="greek">u(=s</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">a swine.</hi>
						Now the Egyptians inhabiting a country situated low, and
						whose soil is naturally soft, have no need of the plough;
						but after the river Nile hath retired from the grounds it
						overflowed, they presently let all their hogs into the fields,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.308"/>
						
						and they with their feet and snouts break up the ground,
						and cover the sown seed. Nor ought this to seem strange
						to any one, that there are in the world those who abstain
						from swine's flesh upon such an account as this; when it
						is evident that among barbarous nations there are other
						animals had in greater honor and veneration for lesser,
						if not altogether ridiculous, reasons. For the field-mouse
						only for its blindness was worshipped as a God among the
						Egyptians, because they were of an opinion that darkness
						was before light, and that the latter had its birth from mice
						about the fifth generation at the new moon; and moreover
						that the liver of this creature diminishes in the wane of
						the moon. But they consecrate the lion to the sun, because the lioness alone, of all clawed quadrupeds, brings
						forth her young with their eyesight; for they sleep a moment, and when they are asleep their eyes sparkle. Besides, they place gaping lions' heads for the spouts of their
						fountains, because Nilus overflows the Egyptian fields
						when the sign is Leo: they give it out that their bird ibis,
						as soon as hatched, weighs two drachms, which are of the
						same weight with the heart of a new-born infant; and
						that its legs being spread with the bill make an exact
						equilateral triangle. And yet who can find fault with the
						Egyptians for these trifles, when it is left upon record that
						the Pythagoreans worshipped a white cock, and of sea
						creatures abstained especially from the mullet and urtic.
						The Magi that descended from Zoroaster adored the land
						hedgehog above other creatures, but had a deadly spite
						against water-rats, and thought that man was dear in the
						eyes of the Gods who destroyed most of them. But I
						should think that if the Jews had such an antipathy
						against a hog, they would kill it as the magicians do
						mice; when, on the contrary, they are by their religion as
						much prohibited to kill as to eat it. And perhaps there
						may be some reason given for this; for as the ass is worshipped
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.309"/>
						
						 by them as the first discoverer of fountains, so perhaps the hog may be had in like veneration, which first
						taught them to sow and plough. Nay, some say that the
						Jews also abstain from hares, as abominable and unclean.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>They have reason for that, said Lamprias, because a
						hare is so like an ass which they detest;<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The Greek text here is badly mutilated. (G.)</note> for in its color,
						ears, and the sparkling of its eyes, it is so like an ass, that
						I do not know any little creature that represents a great
						one so much as a hare doth an ass; unless in this likewise
						they imitate the Egyptians, and suppose that there is something of divinity in the swiftness of this creature, as also
						in its quickness of sense; for the eyes of hares are so unwearied that they sleep with them open. Besides they
						seem to excel all other creatures in quickness of hearing;
						whence it was that the Egyptians painted the ear of a hare
						amongst their other hieroglyphics, as an emblem of hearing. But the Jews do hate swine's flesh, because all the
						barbarians are naturally fearful of a scab and leprosy,
						which they presume comes by eating such kind of flesh.
						For we may observe that all pigs under the belly are overspread with a leprosy and scab; which may be supposed
						to proceed from an ill disposition of body and corruption
						within, which breaks out through the skin. Besides,
						swine's feeding is commonly so nasty and filthy, that it
						must of necessity cause corruptions and vicious humors;
						for, setting aside those creatures that are bred from and
						live upon dung, there is no other creature that takes so
						much delight to wallow in the mire, and in other unclean
						and stinking places. Hogs' eyes are said to be so flattened
						and fixed upon the ground, that they see nothing above
						them, nor ever look up to the sky, except when forced
						upon their back they turn their eyes to the sun against nature. Therefore this creature, at other times most clamorous, when laid upon his back, is still, as astonished at the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.310"/>
						
						unusual sight of the heavens; while the greatness of the
						fear he is in (as it is supposed) is the cause of his silence.
						And if it be lawful to intermix our discourse with fables,
						it is said that Adonis was slain by a boar. Now Adonis
						is supposed to be the same with Bacchus; and there are a

						the greatest and most holy solemnity of the Jews is exactly
						agreeable to the holy rites of Bacchus; for that which
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.311"/>
						
						they call the Fast they celebrate in the midst of the vintage, furnishing their tables with all sorts of fruits, while
						they sit under tabernacles made of vines and ivy; and
						the day which immediately goes before this they call the
						day of Tabernacles. Within a few days after they celebrate another feast, not darkly but openly, dedicated to
						Bacchus, for they have a feast amongst them called Kradephoria, from carrying palm-trees, and Thyrsophoria, when
						they enter into the temple carrying thyrsi. What they
						do within I know not; but it is very probable that they
						perform the rites of Bacchus. First they have little trumpets, such as the Grecians used to have at their Bacchanalia to call upon their Gods withal. Others go before
						them playing upon harps, which they call Levites, whether
						so named from Lusius or Evius,&mdash;either word agrees with
						Bacchus. And I suppose that their Sabbaths have some
						relation to Bacchus; for even at this day many call the
						Bacchi by the name of Sabbi, and they make use of that
						word at the celebration of Bacchus's orgies. And this
						may be made appear out of Demosthenes and Menander.
						Nor would it be absurd, were any one to say that the name
						Sabbath was imposed upon this feast from the agitation
						and excitement (<foreign lang="greek">so/bhsis</foreign>) which the priests of Bacchus indulged in. The Jews themselves testify no less; for when
						they keep the Sabbath, they invite one another to drink till
						they are drunk; or if they chance to be hindered by some
						more weighty business, it is the fashion at least to taste the
						wine. Some perhaps may surmise that these are mere
						conjectures. But there are other arguments which will
						clearly evince the truth of what I assert. The first may
						be drawn from their High-priest, who on holidays enters
						their temple with his mitre on, arrayed in a skin of a
						hind embroidered with gold, wearing buskins, and a coat
						hanging down to his ankles; besides, he has a great many
						little bells hanging at his garment which make a noise
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.312"/>
						
						as he walks the streets. So in the nightly ceremonies
						of Bacchus (as the fashion is amongst us), they make
						use of musical instruments, and call the God's nurses
						<foreign lang="greek">xalkodrustai</foreign>. High up on the wall of their temple is a representation of the thyrsus and timbrels, which surely can
						belong to no other God than Bacchus. Moreover they are
						forbidden the use of honey in their sacrifices, because they
						suppose that a mixture of honey corrupts and deads the
						wine. And honey was used for sacrificing in former days,
						and with it the ancients were wont to make themselves
						drunk, before the vine was known. And at this day barbarous people who want wine drink metheglin, allaying
						the sweetness of the honey by bitter roots, much of the
						taste of our wine. The Greeks offered to their Gods these
						sober offerings or honey-offerings, as they called them,
						because that honey was of a nature quite contrary to wine.
						But this is no inconsiderable argument that Bacchus was
						worshipped by the Jews, in that, amongst other kinds of
						punishment, that was most remarkably odious by which
						malefactors were forbid the use of wine for so long a time
						as the judge was pleased to prescribe. Those thus punished . . .

                  <p>But formerly, I am sure, you did not lean to nor like their
						opinion, who will not allow the soul to have any proper
						agreeable pleasure, which without respect to the body she
						desires for herself; but define that she lives as a form assistant to the body, is directed by the passions of it, and,
						as that is affected, is either pleased or grieved, or, like a
						looking-glass, only receives the images of those sensible
						impressions made upon the body. This sordid and debas
						ing opinion is especially in this way confuted; for at a
						feast, the genteel well-bred men after supper fall upon
						some topic or another as second course, and cheer one another by their pleasant talk. Now the body hath very little or no share in this; which evidently proves that this is
						a particular banquet for the soul, and that those pleasures
						are peculiar to her, and different from those which pass to
						her through the body and are vitiated thereby. Now, as
						nurses, when they feed children, taste a little of their pap,
						and have but small pleasure therefrom, but when the
						infants are satisfied, leave crying, and go to sleep, then being at their own disposal, they take such meat and drink
						as is agreeable to their own bodies; thus the soul partakes
						of the pleasures that arise from eating and drinking, like
						a nurse, being subservient to the appetites of the body,
						kindly yielding to its necessities and wants, and calming
						its desires; but when that is satisfied and at rest, then being free from her business and servile employment, she
						seeks her own proper pleasures, revels on discourse, problems, stories, curious questions, or subtle resolutions.

						Nay, what shall a man say, when he sees the dull unlearned fellows after supper minding such pleasures as
						have not the least relation to the body? They tell tales,
						propose riddles, or set one another a guessing at names,
						comprised and hid under such and such numbers. Thus
						mimics, drolls, Menander and his actors were admitted into
						banquets, not because they can free the eye from any pain,
						or raise any tickling motion in the flesh; but because the
						soul, being naturally philosophical and a lover of instruction, covets its own proper pleasure and satisfaction, when
						it is free from the trouble of looking after the body.</p>

						meet together, the remembrance of the comedy led us to
						this enquiry,&mdash;Why we are disturbed at the real voices of
						men, either angry, pensive, or afraid, and yet are delighted
						to hear others represent them, and imitate their gestures,
						speeches, and exclamations. Every one in the company gave
						almost the same reason. For they said, he that only represents excels him that really feels, inasmuch as he doth not
						suffer the misfortunes; which we knowing are pleased and
						delighted on that account.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>But I, though it was not properly my talent, said that
						we, being by nature rational and lovers of ingenuity, are
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.315"/>
						
						delighted with and admire every thing that is artificially
						and ingeniously contrived. For as a bee, naturally loving
						sweet things, seeks after and flies to any thing that has any
						mixture of honey in it; so man, naturally loving ingenuity and elegancy, is very much inclined to embrace and
						highly approve every word or action that is seasoned with
						wit and judgment. Thus, if any one offers a child a piece
						of bread, and at the same time a little dog or ox made in
						paste, we shall see the boy run eagerly to the latter; so
						likewise if any one offers him silver in the lump, and another a beast or a cup of the same metal, he will rather
						choose that in which he sees a mixture of art and reason.
						Upon the same account it is that children are much in love
						with riddles, and such fooleries as are difficult and intricate; for whatever is curious and subtle doth attract and
						allure human nature, as antecedently to all instruction
						agreeable and proper to it. And therefore, because he
						that is really affected with grief or anger presents us with
						nothing but the common bare passion, but in the imitation
						some dexterity and persuasiveness appears, we are naturally inclined to be disturbed at the former, whilst the latter delights us. It is unpleasant to see a sick man, or one
						that is at his last gasp; yet with content we can look upon
						the picture of Philoctetes, or the statue of Jocasta, in
						whose face it is commonly said that the workmen mixed
						silver, so that the brass might represent the face and color
						of one ready to faint and yield up the ghost. And this,
						said I, the Cyrenaics may use as a strong argument against
						you Epicureans, that all the sense of pleasure which arises
						from the working of any object on the ear or eye is not in
						those organs, but in the intellect itself. Thus the continual cackling of a hen or cawing of a crow is very ungrateful and disturbing; yet he that imitates those noises well
						pleases the hearers. Thus to behold a consumptive man
						is no delightful spectacle; yet with pleasure we can view
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.316"/>
						
						the pictures and statues of such persons, because the very
						imitating hath something in it very agreeable to the mind,
						which allures and captivates its faculties. For upon what
						account, for God's sake, from what external impression
						upon our organ, should men be moved to admire Parmeno's sow so much as to pass it into a proverb? Yet it is
						reported, that Parmeno being very famous for imitating the
						grunting of a pig, some endeavored to rival and outdo
						him. And when the hearers, being prejudiced, cried out,
						Very well indeed, but nothing comparable to Parmeno's sow;
						one took a pig under his arm and came upon the stage.
						And when, though they heard the very pig, they still continued, This is nothing comparable to Parmeno's sow; he
						threw his pig amongst them, to show that they judged according to opinion and not truth. And hence it is very
						evident, that like motions of the sense do not always raise
						like affections in the mind, when there is not an opinion
						that the thing done was not neatly and ingeniously performed.

						<lb/> THAT THE PRIZE FOR POETS AT THE GAMES WAS ANCIENT.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AT the solemnity of the Pythian Games, there was a consult about taking away all such sports as had lately crept
							in and were not of ancient institution. For after they had
							taken in the tragedian in addition to the three ancient,
							which were as old as the solemnity itself, the Pythian
							piper, the harper, and the singer to the harp, as if a large
							gate were opened, they could not keep out an infinite crowd
							of plays and musical entertainments of all sorts that rushed
							in after him. Which indeed made no unpleasant variety,
							and increased the company, but yet impaired the gravity
							and neatness of the solemnity. Besides it must create a
							great deal of trouble to the umpires, and considerable dissatisfaction
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.317"/>
							
							 to very many, since but few could obtain the
							prize. It was chiefly agreed upon, that the orators and
							poets should be removed; and this determination did not
							proceed from any hatred to learning, but forasmuch as
							such contenders are the most noted and worthiest men of
							all, therefore they reverenced them, and were troubled that,
							when they must judge every one deserving, they could not
							bestow the prize equally upon all. I, being present at this
							consult, dissuaded those who were for removing things from
							their present settled order, and who thought this variety
							as unsuitable to the solemnity as many strings and many
							notes to an instrument. And when at supper, Petraeus
							the president and director of the sports entertaining us,
							the same subject was discoursed on, I defended music, and
							maintained that poetry was no upstart intruder, but that it
							was time out of mind admitted into the sacred games, and
							crowns were given to the best performer. Some straight
							imagined that I intended to produce some old musty stories,
							like the funeral solemnities of Oeolycus the Thessalian or
							of Amphidamas the Chalcidean, in which they say Homer
							and Hesiod contended for the prize. But passing by these
							instances as the common theme of every grammarian, as

							the best speaker,&mdash;omitting all these, I said that Acastus
							at his father Pelias's funeral set a prize for contending
							poets, and Sibylla won it. At this, a great many demanding some authority for this unlikely and incredible relation,
							I happily recollecting myself produced Acesander, who in
							his description of Africa hath this relation; but I must
							confess this is no common book. But Polemo the Athenian's Commentary of the Treasures of the City Delphi I
							suppose most of you have diligently perused, he being a
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.318"/>
							
							very learned man, and diligent in the Greek antiquities.
							In him you shall find that in the Sicyonian treasure there
							was a golden book dedicated to the God, with this inscription: Aristomache, the poetess of Erythraea, dedicated
							this after she had got the prize at the Isthmian games.
							Nor is there any reason, I continued, why we should so
							admire and reverence the Olympic games, as if, like Fate,
							they were unalterable, and never admitted any change
							since the first institution. For the Pythian, it is true, hath
							had three or four musical prizes added; but all the exercises of the body were for the most part the same from
							the beginning. But in the Olympian all beside racing are
							late additions. They instituted some, and abolished them
							again; such were the races of mules, either rode or in a
							chariot, as likewise the crown appointed for boys that were
							victorious in the five contests. And, in short, a thousand
							things in those games are mere novelties. And I fear to
							tell you how at Pisa they had a single combat, where he
							that yielded or was overcome was killed upon the place,
							lest again you may require an author for my story, and I
							may appear ridiculous if amidst my cups I should forget
							the name.

               <head>Question III.
						<lb/> WHY WAS THE PINE COUNTED SACRED TO NEPTUNE AND BACCHUS?
						AND WHY AT FIRST WAS THE CONQUEROR IN THE ISTHMIAN
						GAMES CROWNED WITH A GARLAND OF PINE, AFTERWARDS WITH PARSLEY, AND NOW AGAIN WITH PINE?
						<lb/> LUCANIUS, PRAXITELES.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THIS question was started, why the Isthmian garland
						was made of pine. We were then at supper in Corinth,
						in the time of the Isthmian games, with Lucanius the
						chief priest. Praxiteles the commentator brought this
						fable for a reason; it is said that the body of Melicertes
						was found fixed to a pine-tree by the sea; and not far
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.319"/>
						
						from Megara, there is a place called the Race of a Fair
						Lady, through which the Megarians say that Ino, with her
						son Melicertes in her arms, ran to the sea. And when
						many advanced the common opinion, that the pine-tree
						garland peculiarly belongs to Neptune, and Lucanius added
						that it is sacred to Bacchus too, but yet, for all that, it
						might also be appropriated to the honor of Melicertes, this
						began the question, why the ancients dedicated the pine to
						Neptune and Bacchus. As for my part, it did not seem
						incongruous to me, for both the Gods seem to preside over
						the moist and generative principle; and almost all the
						Greeks sacrifice to Neptune the nourisher of plants, and
						to Bacchus the preserver of trees. Beside, it may be
						said that the pine peculiarly agrees to Neptune, not, as
						Apollodorus thinks, because it grows by the sea-side, or
						because it loves a bleak place (for some give this reason),
						but because it is used in building ships; for the pine
						together with the like trees, as fir and cypress, affords the
						best and the lightest timber, and likewise pitch and rosin,
						without which the compacted planks would be altogether
						unserviceable at sea. To Bacchus they dedicate the pine,
						because it gives a pleasant seasoning to wine, for amongst
						pines they say the sweetest and most delicious grapes grow.
						The cause of this Theophrastus thinks to be the heat of
						the soil; for pines grow most in chalky grounds. Now
						chalk is hot, and therefore must very much conduce to the
						concoction of the wine; as a chalky spring affords the
						lightest and sweetest water; and if chalk is mixed with
						corn, by its heat it makes the grains swell, and considerably
						increases the heap. Besides, it is probable that the vine
						itself is bettered by the pine, for that contains several things
						which are good to preserve wine. All cover the insides of
						wine-casks with pitch, and many mix rosin with wine, as
						the Euboeans in Greece, and in Italy those that live about
						the river Po. From the parts of Gaul about Vienna
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.320"/>
						
						there is a sort of pitched wine brought, which the Romans
						value very much; for such things mixed with it do not
						only give it a good flavor, but make the wine generous,
						taking away by their gentle heat all the crude, watery, and
						undigested particles.</p>

						company, a man well read in all sorts of polite learning,
						cried out: Good Gods! was it not but the other day that
						the Isthmian garland began to be made of pine? And was
						not the crown anciently of twined parsley? I am sure in
						a certain comedy a covetous man is brought in speaking
						thus:

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>I put them in mind that some imagine that <foreign lang="greek">qermo/n</foreign>,
						<hi rend="italics">hot,</hi> is signified by <foreign lang="greek">zwro/teron</foreign>, and that hotter means simply
						faster, as when we command servants to bestir themselves

						dispute is frivolous, since it is raised upon this supposition,
						that if <foreign lang="greek">zwro/teron</foreign> signifies <hi rend="italics">more pure wine,</hi> Achilles's command would be absurd, as Zoilus of Amphipolis imagined.
						For first he did not consider that Achilles saw Phoenix and
						Ulysses to be old men, who are not pleased with diluted
						wine, and upon that account forbade any mixture. Besides,
						having been Chiron's scholar, and from him having learned
						the rules of diet, he considered that weaker and more
						diluted liquors were fittest for those bodies that lay at ease,
						and were not employed in their customary exercise or labor.
						Thus with the other provender he gave his horses smallage,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.323"/>
						
						and this upon very good reason; for horses that lie still
						grow sore in their feet, and smallage is the best remedy in
						the world against that. And you will not find smallage
						or any thing of the same nature given to any other horses
						in the whole Iliad. Thus Achilles, being skilled in
						physic, provided suitable provender for his horses, and
						used the lightest diet himself, as the fittest whilst he lay at
						ease. But those that had been wearied all day in fight he
						did not think convenient to treat like those that had lain at
						ease, but commanded more pure and stronger wine to be
						prepared. Besides, Achilles doth not appear to be naturally addicted to drinking, but he was of a haughty inexorable temper.

                  <p>A DISCOURSE happening at supper concerning those
						that are said to bewitch or have a bewitching eye, most of
						the company looked upon it as a whim, and laughed at it.
						But Metrius Florus, who then gave us a supper, said that
						the strange events wonderfully confirmed the report; and
						because we cannot give a reason for the thing, therefore
						to disbelieve the relation was absurd, since there are a
						thousand things which evidently are, the reasons of which
						we cannot readily assign. And, in short, he that requires
						every thing should be probable destroys all wonder and admiration;
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.328"/>
						
						 and where the cause is not obvious, there we
						begin to doubt, that is, to philosophize. So that they who
						disbelieve all wonderful relations do in some measure take
						away philosophy. The cause why any thing is so, reason
						must find out; but that a thing is so, testimony is a
						sufficient evidence; and we have a thousand instances of
						this sort attested. We know that some men by looking
						upon young children hurt them very much, their weak and
						soft temperature being wrought upon and perverted, whilst
						those that are strong and firm are not so liable to be
						wrought upon. And Phylarchus tells us that the Thibians, the old inhabitants about Pontus, were destructive
						not only to little children, but to some also of riper years;
						for those upon whom they looked or breathed, or to whom
						they spake, would languish and grow sick. And this,
						likely, those of other countries perceived who bought
						slaves there. But perhaps this is not so much to be wondered at, for in touching and handling there is some apparent principle and cause of the effect. And as when you
						mix other birds' wings with the eagles', the plumes waste
						and suddenly consume; so there is no reason to the contrary, but that one man's touch may be good and advantageous, and another's hurtful and destructive. But that
						some, by being barely looked upon, are extremely prejudiced is certain; though the stories are disbelieved, because the reason is hard to be given.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>True, said I, but methinks there is some small track
						to the cause of this effect, if you come to the effluvia
						of bodies. For smell, voice, breath, and the like, are
						effluvia from animal bodies, and material parts that move
						the senses, which are wrought upon by their impulse.
						Now it is very likely that such effluvia must continually
						part from animals, by reason of their heat and motion; for
						by that the spirits are agitated, and the body, being struck
						by those, must continually send forth effluvia. And it
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.329"/>
						
						is probable that these pass chiefly through the eye. For
						the sight, being very vigorous and active, together with the
						spirit upon which it depends, sends forth a strange fiery
						power; so that by it men act and suffer very much, and
						are always proportionably pleased or displeased, according
						as the visible objects are agreeable or not. Love, that
						greatest and most violent passion of the soul, takes its be
						ginning from the eye; so that a lover, when he looks upon
						the fair, flows out, as it were, and seems to mix with them.
						And therefore why should any one, that believes men can
						be affected and prejudiced by the sight, imagine that they
						cannot act and hurt as well? For the mutual looks of
						mature beauties, and that which comes from the eye,
						whether light or a stream of spirits, melt and dissolve
						the lovers with a pleasing pain, which they call the bittersweet of love. For neither by touching or hearing the
						voice of their beloved are they so much wounded and
						wrought upon, as by looking and being looked upon again.
						There is such a communication, such a flame raised by one
						glance, that those must be altogether unacquainted with
						love that wonder at the Median naphtha, that takes fire at a
						distance from the flame. For the glances of a fair one,
						though at a great distance, quickly kindle a fire in the
						lover's breast. Besides everybody knows the remedy for
						the jaundice; if they look upon the bird called charadrios, they are cured. For that animal seems to be of that
						temperature and nature as to receive and draw away the
						disease, that like a stream flows out through the eyes; so
						that the charadrios will not look on one that hath the jaundice; he cannot endure it, but turns away his head and
						shuts his eyes, not envying (as some imagine) the cure he
						performs, but being really hurted by the effluvia of the
						patient. And of all diseases, soreness of the eyes is the
						most infectious; so strong and vigorous is the sight, and
						so easily does it cause infirmities in another.</p>

                  <p>Very right, said Patrocles, and you reason well as
						to changes wrought upon the body; but as to the soul,
						which in some measure exerts the power of witchcraft, how
						can this give any disturbance by the eye? Sir, I replied,
						do not you consider, that the soul, when affected, works
						upon the body? Thoughts of love excite lust, and rage
						often blinds dogs as they fight with wild beasts. Sorrow, covetousness, or jealousy makes us change color,
						and destroys the habit of the body; and envy more than
						any passion, when fixed in the soul, fills the body full of
						ill humors, and makes it pale and ugly; which deformities
						good painters in their pictures of envy endeavor to represent. Now, when men thus perverted by envy fix their
						eyes upon another, and these, being nearest to the soul,
						easily draw the venom from it, and send out as it were
						poisoned darts, it is no wonder, in my mind, if he that is
						looked upon is hurt. Thus the biting of a dog when
						mad is most dangerous ; and then the seed of a man is
						most prolific, when he embraces one that he loves; and in
						general the affections of the mind strengthen and invigorate the powers of the body. And therefore people imagine that those amulets that are preservative against
						witchcraft are likewise good and efficacious against envy;
						the sight by the strangeness of the spectacle being diverted, so that it cannot make so strong an impression
						upon the patient. This, Florus, is what I can say; and

                  <p>At any other time, I replied, I question not but I
						shall give you full satisfaction. But now, sir, after such a
						large pot as you have seen me take, I boldly affirm, that
						all passions which have been fixed in the soul a long time
						raise ill humors in the body, which by continuance growing strong enough to be, as it were, a new nature, being
						excited by any intervening accident, force men, though
						unwilling, to their accustomed passions. Consider the
						timorous, they are afraid even of those things that preserve them. Consider the pettish, they are angry with
						their best and dearest friends. Consider the amorous and
						lascivious, in the height of their fury they dare violate a
						Vestal. For custom is very powerful to draw the temper
						of the body to any thing that is suitable to it; and he that
						is apt to fall will stumble at every thing that lies in his
						way. So that we need not wonder at those that have
						raised in themselves an envious and bewitching habit, if
						according to the peculiarity of their passion they are carried on to suitable effects; for when they are once moved,
						they do that which the nature of the thing, not which
						their will, leads them to. For as a sphere must necessarily move spherically, and a cylinder cylindrically,
						according to the difference of their figures; thus his dis
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.332"/>
						
						position makes an envious man move enviously to all
						things; and it is likely they should chiefly hurt their most
						familiar acquaintance and best beloved. And that fine fellow Eutelidas you mentioned, and the rest that are said to
						overlook themselves, may be easily and upon good rational
						grounds accounted for; for, according to Hippocrates. a
						good habit of body, when at height, is easily perverted,
						and bodies come to their full maturity do not stand at a
						stay there, but fall and waste down to the contrary extreme. And therefore when they are in very good plight,
						and see themselves look much better than they expected,
						they gaze and wonder; but then their body being nigh to
						change, and their habit declining into a worse condition,
						they overlook themselves. And this is done when the effluvia are stopped and reflected by the water rather than
						by any other specular body; for this breathes upon them
						whilst they look upon it, so that the very same particles which would hurt others must hurt themselves. And
						this perchance often happens to young children, and the
						cause of their diseases is falsely attributed to those that
						look upon them.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THIS discourse ended, the next question was about fig-trees, how so luscious and sweet fruit should come from so
							bitter a tree. For the leaf from its roughness is called
							<foreign lang="greek">qri/on</foreign>. The wood of it is full of sap, and as it burns sends
							forth a very biting smoke; and the ashes of it thoroughly
							burnt are so acrimonious, that they make a lye extremely
							detersive. And, which is very strange, all other trees that
							bud and bear fruit put forth blossoms too; but the fig-tree
							never blossoms. And if (as some say) it is never thunderstruck, that likewise may be attributed to the sharp juices
							and bad temper of the stock; for such things are as secure
							from thunder as the skin of a sea calf or hyena. Then said
							the old man: It is no wonder that when all the sweetness is
							separated and employed in making the fruit, that which is
							left should be bitter and unsavory. For as the liver, all the
							gall being gathered in its proper place, is itself very sweet;
							so the fig-tree having parted with its oil and sweet particles
							to the fruit, reserves no portions for itself. For that this
							tree hath some good juice, I gather from what they say of
							rue, which growing under a fig-tree is sweeter than usual,
							and hath a sweeter and more palatable juice, as if it drew
							some sweet particles from the tree which mollified its offensive and corroding qualities; unless perhaps, on the

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Florus bade us not mind the Egyptians, but speak

						But I replied: The Egyptians are not contrary to the Greeks
						in this matter; for the profession of purity and chastity
						forbids getting children, laughter, wine, and many other
						very commendable and lawful things; and perhaps such
						votaries avoid salt, as being, according to some men's

                  <p>What then, said Florus, shall we say that salt is
						termed divine for that reason? Indeed that is very considerable, for men for the most part deify those common
						things that are exceeding useful to their necessities and
						wants, as water, light, the seasons of the year; and the
						earth they do not only think to be divine, but a very God.
						Now salt is as useful as either of these, being a sort of protector to the food as it comes into the body, and making it
						palatable and agreeable to the appetite. But consider
						farther, whether its power of preserving dead bodies from
						rotting a long time be not a divine property, and opposite
						to death; since it preserves part, and will not suffer that
						which is mortal wholly to be destroyed. But as the soul,
						which is our diviner part, connects the limbs of animals,
						and keeps the composure from dissolution; thus salt applied to dead bodies, and imitating the work of the soul,
						stops those parts that were falling to corruption, binds and
						confines them, and so makes them keep their union and
						agreement with one another. And therefore some of the
						Stoics say, that swine's flesh then deserves the name of a
						body, when the soul like salt spreads through it and keeps
						the parts from dissolution. Besides, you know that we
						account lightning to be sacred and divine, because the
						bodies that are thunder-struck do not rot for a long time;
						what wonder is it then, that the ancients called salt as well

						bitches not apt to be hot, give them salt and seasoned
						flesh, to stir up and awaken their sleeping lechery and
						vigor. Besides, the ships that carry salt breed abundance

						the help of the males, only by licking the salt. But it is
						most probable that the salt raiseth an itching in animals,

						bewitching beauty, such as is apt to move and entice,

               <head>Question I.
						<lb/> WHAT IS THE REASON THAT THOSE THAT ARE FASTING ARE MORE THIRSTY THAN HUNGRY?
						<lb/> PLUTARCH AND OTHERS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>I PRESENT you with this Sixth Book of Table Discourses,
							wherein the first thing that cometh to be discussed is an
							enquiry into the reason why those that are fasting are
							more inclinable to drink than to eat. For the assertion
							carries in it a repugnancy to the standing rules of reason;
							forasmuch as the decayed stock of dry nourishment seems
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.340"/>
							
							more naturally to call for its proper supplies. Whereupon
							I told the company, that of those things whereof our bodies
							are composed, heat only&mdash;or, however, above all the rest&mdash;
							stands in continual need of such accessions; for the truth
							of which this may be urged as a convincing argument:
							neither air, water, nor earth requires any matter to feed
							upon, or devours whatsoever lies next it; but fire alone
							doth. Hence it comes to pass that young men, by reason
							of their greater share of natural heat, have commonly
							greater stomachs than old men; whereas on the contrary,
							old men can endure fasting much better, for this only
							reason, because their natural heat is grown weaker and
							decayed. Just so we see it fares with bloodless animals,
							which by reason of the want of heat require very little
							nourishment. Besides, every one of us finds by experience, that bodily exercises, clamors, and whatever other
							actions by violent motion occasion heat, commonly sharpen
							our stomachs and get us a better appetite. Now, as I take
							it, the most natural and principal nourishment of heat is
							moisture, as it evidently appears from flames, which increase by the pouring in of oil, and from ashes, which are
							of the driest things in nature; for after the humidity is
							consumed by the fire, the terrene and grosser parts remain
							without any moisture at all. Add to these, that fire separates and dissolves bodies by extracting that moisture
							which should keep them close and compact. Therefore,
							when we are fasting, the heat first of all forces the moisture out of the relics of the nourishment that remain
							in the body, and then, pursuing the other humid parts,
							preys upon the natural moisture of the flesh itself. Hence
							the body like clay grows dry, wants drink more than meat;
							till the heat, receiving strength and vigor by our drinking,
							excites an appetite for more substantial food.

               <head>Question II.
						<lb/> WHETHER WANT OF NOURISHMENT CAUSETH HUNGER AND THIRST,
						OR THE CHANGE IN THE FIGURE OF THE PORES OR PASSAGES OF THE BODY.
						<lb/> PHILO, PLUTARCH.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AFTER these things were spoke, Philo the physician
						started the first question, asserting that thirst did not arise
						from the want of nourishment, but from the different transfiguration of certain passages. For, says he, this may be
						made evident, partly from what we see happens to those that
						thirst in the night, who, if sleep chance to steal upon them,
						though they did not drink before, are yet rid of their thirst;
						partly from persons in a fever, who, as soon as the disease
						abates or is removed, thirst no more. Nay, a great many
						men, after they have bathed or vomited, perceive presently
						that their thirst is gone; yet none of these add any thing
						to their former moisture, but only the transfiguration of the
						pores causeth a new order and disposition. And this is
						more evident in hunger; for many sick persons, at the
						same time when they have the greatest need of meat, have
						no stomach. Others, after they have filled their bellies,
						have the same stomachs, and their appetites are rather
						increased than abated. There are a great many besides
						who loathe all sorts of diet, yet by taking of a pickled
						olive or caper recover and confirm their lost appetites.
						This doth clearly evince, that hunger proceeds from some
						change in the pores, and not from any want of sustenance,
						forasmuch as such kind of food lessens the defect by adding
						food, but increases the hunger; and the pleasing relish and
						poignancy of such pickles, by binding and straitening the
						mouth of the ventricle, and again by opening and loosening
						of it, beget in it a convenient disposition to receive meat,
						which we call by the name of appetite.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>I must confess this discourse seemed to carry in it
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.342"/>
						
						some shadow of reason and probability; but in the main
						it is directly repugnant to the chief end of nature, to which
						appetite directs every animal. For that makes it desire a
						supply of what they stand in need of, and avoid a defect of
						their proper food. Now to deny that this very thing, which
						principally distinguishes an animate creature from an inanimate, conduces to the preservation and duration of such a
						creature, being that which craves and receives those things
						which the body needs to supply its wants, and, on the contrary, to suppose that such an appetite arises from the
						transfiguration or the greater or lesser size of the pores,
						is an absurdity worthy only of such as have no regard at
						all for Nature. Besides, it is absurd to think that a body
						through the want of natural heat should be chilled, and
						should not in like manner hunger and thirst through the
						want of natural moisture and nourishment. And yet this
						is more absurd, that Nature when overcharged should
						desire to disburden herself, and yet should not require to
						be filled on account of emptiness, but on account of some
						affection or other, I know not what. Moreover, these
						needs and supplies in relation to animals have some resemblance to those we see in husbandry. There are a great
						many like qualities and like provisions on both sides. For
						in a drought we water our grounds, and in case of excessive heat, we frequently make use of moderate coolers;
						and when our fruits are too cold, we endeavor to preserve
						and cherish them, by covering and making fences about
						them. And for such things as are out of the reach of
						human power, we implore the assistance of the Gods, that
						is, to send us softening dews, sunshines qualified with
						moderate winds; that so Nature, being always desirous of
						a due mixture, may have her wants supplied. And for
						this reason I presume it was that nourishment is called
						<foreign lang="greek">trofh/</foreign> (from <foreign lang="greek">throu=n</foreign>), because it watches and preserves Nature.
						Now Nature is preserved in plants, which are destitute of
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.343"/>
						
						sense, by the favorable influence of the circumambient air
						(as Empedocles says), moistening them in such a measure
						as is most agreeable to their nature. But as for us men,
						our appetites prompt us on to the chase and pursuance of
						whatsoever is wanting to our natural temperament.</p>
                  <p>Now let us pass to the examination of the truth of the
							arguments that seem to favor the contrary opinion. And
							for the first, I suppose that those meats that are palatable
							and of a quick and sharp taste do not beget in us an appetite, but rather bite and fret those parts that receive the
							nourishment, as we find that scratching the skin causes
							itching. And supposing we should grant that this affection
							or disposition is the very thing which we call the appetite,
							it is probable that, by the operation of such kind of food
							as this, the nourishment may be made small, and so much
							of it as is convenient for Nature severed from the rest, so
							that the indigency proceeds not from the transmutation,
							but front the evacuation and purgation of the passages.
							For sharp, tart, and salt things grate the inward matter,
							and by dispersing of it cause digestion, so that by the concoctions of the old there may arise an appetite for new.
							Nor does the cessation of thirst after a bath spring from
							the different position of the passages, but from a new supply of moisture received into the flesh, and conveyed from
							thence to them also. And vomiting, by throwing off whatever is disagreeable to Nature, puts her in a capacity of
							enjoying what is most suitable for her. For thirst does
							not call for a superfluity of moisture, but only for so much
							as sufficeth Nature; and therefore, though a man had
							plenty of disagreeable and unnatural moisture, yet he wants
							still, for that stops the course of the natural, which Nature
							is desirous of, and hinders a due mixture and temperament,
							till it be cast out and the passages receive what is most
							proper and convenient for them. Moreover, a fever forces
							all the moisture downward; and the middle parts being
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.344"/>
							
							in a flame, it all retires thither, and there is shut up
							and forcibly detained. And therefore it is usual with a
							great many to vomit, by reason of the density of the inward parts squeezing out the moisture, and likewise to
							thirst, by reason of the poor and dry state the rest of the
							body is in. But after the violence of the distemper is once
							abated, and the raging heat hath left the middle parts, the
							moisture begins to disperse itself again; and according to
							its natural motion, by a speedy conveyance into all the
							parts, it refreshes the entrails, softens and makes tender
							the dry and parched flesh. Very often also it causes sweat,
							and then the defect which occasioned thirst ceases; for the
							moisture leaving that part of the body wherein it was
							forcibly detained, and out of which it hardly made an
							escape, retires to the place where it is wanted. For as it
							fares with a garden wherein there is a large well,&mdash;if nobody draw thereof and water it, the herbs must needs
							wither and die,&mdash;so it fares with a body; if all the moisture be contracted into one part, it is no wonder if the rest
							be in want and dry, till it is diffused again over the other
							limbs. Just so it happens to persons in a fever, after the
							heat of the disease is over, and likewise to those who go
							to sleep thirsty. For in these, sleep draws the moisture
							out of the middle parts, and equally distributes it amongst
							the rest, satisfying them all. But, I pray, what kind of
							transfiguration of the passages is this which causes hunger
							and thirst? For my part, I know no other distinction of
							the passages but in respect of their number, or that some
							of them are shut, others open. As for those that are shut,
							they can neither receive meat nor drink; and as for those
							that are open, they make an empty space, which is nothing
							but a want of that which Nature requires. Thus, sir,
							when men dye cloth, the liquor in which they dip it hath
							very sharp and abstersive particles; which, consuming and
							scouring off all the matter that filled the pores, make the
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.345"/>
							
							cloth more apt to receive the dye, because its pores are
							empty and want something to fill them up.

               <head>Question III.
						<lb/> WHAT IS THE REASON THAT HUNGER IS ALLAYED BY DRINKING, BUT THIRST INCREASED BY EATING?
						<lb/> THE HOST, PLUTARCH, AND OTHERS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AFTER we had gone thus far, the master of the feast
						told the company that the former points were reasonably
						well discussed; and waiving at present the discourse concerning the evacuation and repletion of the pores, he requested us to fall upon another question, that is, how it
						comes to pass that hunger is staid by drinking, when, on
						the contrary, thirst is more violent after eating. Those who
						assign the reason to be in the pores seem with a great
						deal of ease and probability, though not with so much
						truth, to explain the thing. For seeing the pores in all
						bodies are of different sorts and sizes, the more capacious
						receive both dry and humid nourishment, the lesser take
						in drink, not meat; but the vacuity of the former causes
						hunger, of the latter thirst. Hence it is that men that
						thirst are never the better after they have eaten, the pores
						by reason of their straitness denying admittance to grosser
						nourishment, and the want of suitable supply still remaining. But after hungry men have drunk, the moisture
						enters the greater pores, fills the empty spaces, and in
						part assuages the violence of the hunger.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Of this effect, said I, I do not in the least doubt, but
						I do not approve of the reason they give for it. For if
						any one should admit these pores (which some are so unreasonably fond of) to be in the flesh, he must needs make
						it a very soft, loose, flabby substance; and that the same
						parts do not receive the meat and drink, but that they run
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.346"/>
						
						through different canals and strainers in them, seems to
						me to be a very strange and unaccountable opinion.</p>
                  <p>For the moisture mixes with the dry food, and by the
							assistance of the natural heat and spirits cuts the nourishment far smaller than any cleaver or chopping-knife, to
							the end that every part of it may be exactly fitted to each
							part of the body, not applied, as they would have it, to
							little vessels and pores, but united and incorporated with
							the whole substance. And unless the thing were explained after this manner, the hardest knot in the question would still remain unsolved. For a man that has a
							thirst upon him, supposing he eats and doth not drink, is
							so far from quenching, that he does highly increase it.
							This point is yet untouched. But mark, said I, whether
							the positions on my side be clear and evident or not. In
							the first place, we take it for granted that moisture is
							wasted and destroyed by dryness, that the drier parts of the
							nourishment, qualified and softened by moisture, are diffused and fly away in vapors. Secondly, we must by no
							means suppose that all hunger is a total privation of dry,
							and thirst of humid nutriment, but only a moderate one,
							and such as is sufficient to cause the one or the other; for
							whoever are wholly deprived of either of these, they
							neither hunger nor thirst, but die instantly. These things
							being laid down as a foundation, it will be no hard matter
							to find out the cause. Thirst is increased by eating for
							this reason, because that meat by its natural siccity contracts and destroys all that small quantity of moisture
							which remained scattered here and there through the
							body; just as it happens in things obvious to our senses;
							we see the earth, dust, and the like presently suck in the
							moisture that is mixed with them. Now, on the contrary,
							drink must of necessity assuage hunger; for the moisture
							watering and diffusing itself through the dry and parched
							relics of the meat we ate last, by turning them into thin
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.347"/>
							
							juices, conveys them through the whole body, and succors the
							indigent parts. And therefore with very good reason Erasistratus called moisture the vehicle of the meat; for as soon
							as this is mixed with things which by reason of their dryness,
							or some other quality, are slow and heavy, it raises them
							up and carries them aloft. Moreover, several men, when
							they have drunk nothing at all, but only washed themselves, all on a sudden are freed from a violent hunger, because the extrinsic moisture entering the pores makes the
							meat within more succulent and of a more nourishing
							nature, so that the heat and fury of the hunger declines
							and abates; and therefore a great many of those who have
							a mind to starve themselves to death live a long time only
							by drinking water; that is, as long as the siccity does not
							quite consume whatever may be united to and nourish the
							body.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>ONE of the strangers at the table, who took wonderful great delight in drinking of cold water, had some

						they had hung in the well a bucket full of the same water,
						so that it could not touch the sides of the well, and there
						let it remain all night: the next day, when it was brought
						to table, it was colder than the water that was new-drawn. Now this gentleman was an indifferent good
						scholar, and therefore told the company he had learned
						this from Aristotle, who gives the reason of it. The reason which he assigned was this. All water, when it hath
						been once hot, is afterwards more cold; as that which is
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.348"/>
						
						prepared for kings, when it hath boiled a good while upon
						the fire, is afterwards put into a vessel set round with snow,
						and so made cooler; just as we find our bodies more cool
						after we have bathed, because the body, after a short relaxation from heat, is rarefied and more porous, and therefore
						so much the more fitted to receive a larger quantity of air,
						which causes the alteration. Therefore the water, when it
						is drawn out of the well, being first warmed in the air,

						to say, that the same thing is affected by the same thing
						with contrary qualities, no difference at all intervening.
						While the gentleman held his peace, as not knowing what
						to say; there is no cause, said I, that we should raise any
						scruple concerning the nature of the air, forasmuch as
						we are ascertained by sense that it is cold, especially in
						the bottom of a well; and therefore we can never imagine
						that it should make the water hot. But I should rather
						judge this to be the reason: the cold air, though it cannot cool the great quantity of water which is in the well,
						yet can easily cool each part of it, separate from the
						whole.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>I SUPPOSE you may remember what Aristotle says in his
							problems, of little stones and pieces of iron, how it hath
							been observed by some that being thrown into the water
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.349"/>
							
							they temper and cool it. This is no more than barely asserted by him; but we will go farther and enquire into
							the reason of it, the discovery of which will be a matter
							of difficulty. Yes, says I, it will so, and it is much if we
							hit upon it; for do but consider, first of all, do not you
							suppose that the air which comes in from without cools
							the water? But now air has a great deal more power and
							force, when it beats against stones and pieces of iron.
							For they do not, like brazen and earthen vessels, suffer it
							to pass through; but, by reason of their solid bulk, beat
							it back and reflect it into the water, so that upon all parts
							the cold works very strongly. And hence it comes to pass
							that rivers in the winter are colder than the sea, because
							the cold air has a power over them, which by reason of its
							depth it has not over the sea, where it is scattered without
							any reflection. But it is probable that for another reason
							thinner waters may be made colder by the air than thicker,
							because they are not so strong to resist its force. Now
							whetstones and pebbles make the water thinner by drawing to them all the mud and other grosser substances that
							be mixed with it, that so by taking the 'strength from it it
							may the more easily be wrought upon by the cold. But
							besides, lead is naturally cold, as that which, being dissolved in vinegar, makes the coldest of all poisons, called
							white-lead; and stones, by reason of their density, raise
							cold in the bottom of the water. For every stone is nothing else but a congealed lump of frozen earth, though
							some more or less than others; and therefore it is no absurdity to say that stones and lead, by reflecting the air,
							increase the coldness of the water.

							we rather say the clothes are hot, because they cause heat,
							than cold, because they cause cold? Nay, if we must be
							tried by sense, it will be found that they are more cold than
							hot. For at the first putting on of a coat it is cold, and
							so is our bed when we lie down; but afterwards they grow
							hot with the heat of our bodies, because they both keep
							in the heat and keep out the cold. Indeed, feverish persons and others that have a violent heat upon them often
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.351"/>
							
							change their clothes, because they perceive that fresh ones
							at the first putting on are much colder; but within a very
							little time their bodies make them as hot as the others. In
							like manner, as a garment heated makes us hot, so a covering cooled keeps snow cold. Now that which causes this
							cold is the continual emanations of a subtile spirit the snow
							has in it, which spirit, as long as it remains in the snow,
							keeps it compact and close; but, after once it is gone, the
							snow melts and dissolves into water, and instantly loses its
							whiteness, occasioned by a mixture of this spirit with a
							frothy moisture. Therefore at the same time, by the help
							of these clothes, the cold is kept in, and the external air
							is shut out, lest it should thaw the concrete body of the

							not yet been at the fuller's is this, because that in such
							cloth the hair and coarse flocks keep it off from pressing
							too hard upon the snow, and bruising it. So chaff lying
							lightly upon it does not dissolve the body of the snow, besides the chaff lies close and shuts out the warm air, and
							keeps in the natural cold of the snow. Now that snow
							melts by the evaporating of this spirit, we are ascertained
							by sense; for when snow melts it raises a vapor.

                  <p>NIGER, a citizen of ours, was lately come from school,
						after he had spent some time under the discipline of a renowned philosopher, but had learned nothing but those

						others, especially his habit of reproving and of carping at
						whatever upon any occasion chanced to be spoke in company. And therefore, when we were at supper one time
						at Aristio's, not content to assume to himself a liberty to
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.352"/>
						
						rail at all the rest of the preparations as too profuse and
						extravagant, he had a pique at the wine too, and said that
						it ought not to be brought to table strained, but that, observing Hesiod's rule, we ought to drink it new out of the
						vessel, while it has its natural strength and force. Moreover, he added that this way of purging wine takes the
						strength from it, and robs it of its natural heat, which,
						when wine is poured out of one vessel into another, evaporates and dies. Besides he would needs persuade us that
						it showed too much of a vain curiosity, effeminacy, and
						luxury, to convert what is wholesome into that which is
						palatable. For as the riotous, not the temperate, use to
						cut cocks and geld pigs, to make their flesh tender and delicious, even against Nature; just so (if we may use a
						metaphor, says he) those that strain wine geld and emasculate it, whilst their squeamish stomachs will neither suffer them to drink pure wine, nor their intemperance to
						drink moderately. Therefore they make use of this expedient, to the end that it may render the desire they have
						of drinking plentifully more excusable. So they take all
						the strength from the wine, leaving the palatableness still;
						as we use to deal with those with whose constitution cold
						water does not agree, to boil it for them. For they certainly take off all the strength from the wine, by straining
						of it. And this is a great argument, that the wine deads,
						grows flat, and loses its virtue, when it is separated from
						the lees, as from its root and stock; for the ancients for
						very good reason called wine lees, as we use to signify a
						man by his head or soul, as the principal part of him. So
						in Greek, grape-gatherers are said <foreign lang="greek">truga=n</foreign>, the word being
						derived from <foreign lang="greek">tru/c</foreign>, which signifies <hi rend="italics">lees;</hi> and Homer in one
						place calls the fruit of the wine <foreign lang="greek">diatru/gion</foreign>, and the wine itself high-colored and red,&mdash;not pale and yellow, such as
						Aristio gives us to supper, after all goodness is purged out
						of it.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Then Aristio smiling presently replied: Sir, the wine
						I bring to table does not look so pale and lifeless as you
						would have it; but it appears at first sight to be mild
						and well qualified. But for your part, you would glut
						yourself with night wine, which raises melancholy vapors;
						and upon this account you cry out against purgation, which,
						by carrying off whatever might cause melancholy or load
						men's stomachs, and make them drunk or sick, makes it
						mild and pleasant to those that drink it, such as heroes
						(as Homer tells us) were formerly wont to drink. And it
						was not dark-colored wine which he called <foreign lang="greek">ai)=qoy</foreign>, but clear
						and transparent; for otherwise he would never have called
						brass <foreign lang="greek">ai)=qoy</foreign>, after he had given it the epithets man-exalting
						and resplendent. Therefore as the wise Anacharsis, discommending some things that the Grecians enjoined, commended their coals, because they leave the smoke without
						doors, and bring the fire into the house; so you judicious
						men might blame me for some other reason than this. But
						what hurt, I pray, have I done to the wine, by taking from
						it a turbulent and noisome quality, and giving it a better
						taste, though a paler color? Nor have I brought you wine
						to the table which, like a sword, hath lost its edge and
						vigorous relish, but such as is only purged of its dregs and
						filth. But you will say that wine not strained hath a great
						deal more strength. Why so, my friend? One that is
						frantic and distracted has more strength than a man in his
						wits; but when, by the help of hellebore or some other
						fit diet, he is come to himself, that rage and frenzy leave
						him and quite vanish, and the true use of his reason and
						health of body presently comes into its place. In like
						manner, purging of wine takes from it all the strength that
						inflames and enrages the mind, and gives it instead thereof
						a mild and wholesome temper; and I think there is a great
						deal of difference between gaudiness and cleanliness. For
						women, while they paint, perfume, and adorn themselves

						with jewels and purple robes, are accounted gaudy and
						profuse; yet nobody will find fault with them for washing

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>THERE is a certain sacrifice of very ancient institution,
						which the chief magistrate or archon performs always in
						the common-hall, and every private person in his own
						house. 'Tis called the driving out of bulimy; for they whip
						out of doors some one of their servants with a bunch of
						willow rods, repeating these words, Get out of doors,
						bulimy; and enter riches and health. Therefore in my
						year there was a great concourse of people present at the
						sacrifice; and, after all the rights and ceremonies of the
						sacrifice were over, when we had seated ourselves again at
						the table, there was an enquiry made first of all into the
						signification of the word bulimy, then into the meaning of
						the words which are repeated when the servant is turned
						out of doors. But the principal dispute was concerning
						the nature of it, and all its circumstances. First, as for
						the word bulimy, it was agreed upon by all to denote a
						great and public famine, especially among us who use the
						Aeolic dialect, putting <foreign lang="greek">p</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">b</foreign>. For it was not called by
						the ancients <foreign lang="greek">bou/limos</foreign> but <foreign lang="greek">pou/limos</foreign>, that is, <foreign lang="greek">polu\s limo/s</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">much
							hunger.</hi> We concluded that it was not the same with the
						disease called Bubrostis, by an argument fetched out of
						Metrodorus's Ionics. For the said Metrodorus informs us
						that the Smyrnaeans, who were once Aeolians, sacrificed to
						Bubrostis a black bull cut into pieces with the skin on, and
						so burnt it. Now, forasmuch as every species of hunger
						resembles a disease, but more particularly bulimy, which
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.356"/>
						
						is occasioned by an unnatural disposition of the body, these
						two differ as riches and poverty, health and sickness. But
						as the word <hi rend="italics">nauseate</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">nautia=n</foreign>) first took its name from men
						who were stomach-sick in a ship, and afterwards custom
						prevailed so far that the word was applied to all persons
						that were any way in like sort affected; so the word
						bulimy, rising at first from hence, was at last extended to
						a more large and comprehensive signification. What has
						been hitherto said was a general club of the opinions of
						all those who were at table.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>But after we began to enquire after the cause of this
						disease, the first thing that puzzled us was to find out the
						reason why bulimy seizes upon those that travel in the
						snow. As Brutus, one time marching from Dyrrachium to
						Apollonia in a deep snow, was endangered of his life by
						bulimy, whilst none of those that carried the provisions for
						the army followed him; just when the man was ready to
						faint and die, some of his soldiers were forced to run to
						the walls of the enemies' city, and beg a piece of bread of
						the sentinels, by the eating of which he was presently refreshed; for which cause, after Brutus had made himself
						master of the city, he treated all the inhabitants very
						mercifully. Asses and horses are frequently troubled with
						bulimy, especially when they are loaden with dry figs and
						apples; and, which is yet more strange, of all things that

						a consumption as invades the principle of respiration, I can
						no way imagine. I rather think, says he, that abundance
						of heat penned up in the body consumes the nourishment,
						and that failing, the fire as it were goes out. Here it
						comes to pass, that men troubled with this bulimy, when
						they are ready to starve with hunger, if they eat never so
						little meat, are presently refreshed. The reason is, because
						meat digested is like fuel for the heat to feed upon.</p>

						of the word <foreign lang="greek">bou/limos</foreign> without any reason at all; as <foreign lang="greek">pi/nein</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">to

						which concurring with heat causes a faintness. Therefore
						as things that have a good smell recall the spirits of those
						that are faint, so bread affects those that are almost overcome with a bulimy; not that they have any need of food
						(for the least piece of it restores them their strength), but
						the bread calls back their vigor and languishing spirits.
						Now that bulimy is not hunger but a faintness, is manifest
						from all laboring beasts, which are seized with it very
						often through the smell of dry figs and apples; for a smell
						does not cause any want of food, but rather a pain and
						agitation in the stomach.</p>

                  <p>These things seemed to be reasonably well urged;
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.358"/>
						
						and yet we thought that much might be said in the defence
						of the contrary opinion, and that it was possible enough
						to maintain that bulimy ariseth not from condensation
						but rarefication of the stomach. For the spirit which flows
						from the snow is nothing but the sharp point and finest
						scale of the congealed substance, endued with a virtue of
						cutting and dividing not only the flesh, but also silver and
						brazen vessels; for we see that these are not able to keep
						in the snow, for it dissolves and evaporates, and glazes
						over the outmost superficies of the vessels with a thin dew,
						not unlike to ice, which this spirit leaves as it secretly
						passes through the pores. Therefore this piercing spirit,
						like a flame, seizing upon those that travel in the snow,
						seems to burn their outsides, and like fire to enter and
						penetrate the flesh. Hence it is that the flesh is more
						rarefied, and the heat is extinguished by the cold spirit that
						lies upon the superficies of the body; therefore the body
						evaporates a dewy thin sweat, which melts away and
						decays the strength. Now if a man should sit still at such
						a time, there would not much heat fly out of his body.
						But when the motion of the body doth quickly heat the
						nourishment, and that heat bursts through the thin skin,
						there must necessarily be a great loss of strength. Now
						we know by experience, that cold hath a virtue not only to
						condense but also to loosen bodies; for in extreme cold
						winters pieces of lead are found to sweat. And when we
						see that bulimy happens where there is no hunger, we
						may conclude that at that time the body is rather in a fluid
						than condensed state. The reason that bodies are rarefied
						in winter is because of the subtility of the spirit; especially
						when the moving and tiring of the body excites the heat,
						which, as soon as it is subtilized and agitated, flies apace,
						and spreads itself through the whole body. Lastly, it is
						very possible that apples and dry figs exhale some such
						thing as this, which rarefies and attenuates the heat of the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.359"/>
						
						beasts; for different things have a natural tendency as well
						to weaken as to refresh different creatures.

						mirror; for there is nothing rough in it to hinder the reflection, but by reason of its humidity it reflects to the eyes
						the least particle of light from every part of it. As, on
						the contrary, milk, of all other liquids, does not return our
						images, because it hath too many terrene and gross parts
						mixed with it; again, oil of all liquids makes the least
						noise when moved, for it is perfectly humid. When other
						liquids are moved or poured out, their hard and grosser
						parts fall and dash one against another, and so make a
						noise by reason of their roughness. Moreover, oil only is
						pure and unmixed; for it is of all other liquids most compact, nor has it any empty spaces and pores between the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.360"/>
						
						dry and earthy parts, to receive what chances to fall upon
						it. Besides, because of the similitude of parts, it is closely
						joined together, and unfit to be joined to any thing else.
						When oil froths, it does not let any wind in, by reason of
						the contiguity and subtility of its parts; and this is also
						the cause why fire is nourished by it. For fire feeds upon
						nothing but what is moist, for nothing is combustible but
						what is so; for when the fire is kindled, the air turns to
						smoke, and the terrene and grosser parts remain in the
						ashes. Fire preys only upon the moisture, which is its natural nourishment. Indeed water, wine, and other liquors,
						having abundance of earthy and heavy parts in them, by
						falling into fire part it, and by their roughness and weight
						smother and extinguish it. But oil, because purely liquid,
						by reason of its subtility, is overcome by the fire, and so
						changed into flame.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>It is the greatest argument that can be of its humidity, that the least quantity of it spreads itself a great
						way; for so small a drop of honey, water, or any other
						liquid does not extend itself so far, but very often, by
						reason of the dry mixed parts, is presently wasted. Because oil is ductile and soft, men are wont to make use of
						it for anointing their bodies; for it runs along and spreads
						itself through all the parts, and sticks so firmly to them
						that it is not easily washed off. We find by experience,
						that a garment wet with water is presently dried again;
						but it is no easy matter to wash out the spots and stains
						of oil, for it enters deep, because of its most subtile and
						humid nature. Hence it is that Aristotle says, the drops
						of diluted wine are the hardest to be got out of clothes,
						because they are most subtile, and run farther into the
						pores of the cloth.

						<lb/> ARISTIO, PLUTARCH, OTHERS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AT supper we were commending Aristio's cook, who,
							amongst other dishes that he had dressed very curiously,
							brought a cock to table just killed as a sacrifice to Hercules, as tender as though it had been killed a day or two
							before. When Aristio told us that this was no wonder,
							&mdash;seeing such a thing might be very easily done, if the
							cock, as soon as he was killed, was hung upon a fig-tree,
							&mdash;we began to enquire into the reason of what he asserted. Indeed, I must confess, our eye assures us that a
							fig-tree sends out a fierce and strong spirit; which is yet
							more evident, from what we have heard said of bulls.
							That is, a bull, after he is tied to a fig-tree, though never
							so mad before, grows presently tame, and will suffer you
							to touch him, and on a sudden all his rage and fury cool
							and die. But the chiefest cause that works this change is
							the sharp acrimonious quality of the tree. For of all
							trees this is the fullest of sap, and so are its figs, wood,
							and bark; and hence it comes to pass, that the smoke of
							fig-wood is most offensive to the eyes; and when it is
							burned, its ashes make the best lye to scour withal. But
							all these effects proceed from heat. Now there are some
							that say, when the sap of this tree thrown into milk curds
							it, that this effect does not arise from the irregular figures
							of the parts of the milk, which the sap unites and (as it
							were) glues into one body, the smooth and globose parts
							being squeezed out, but that by its heat it loosens the unstable and watery parts of the liquid body. And we may
							use as an argument the unprofitableness of the sap of this
							tree, which, though it is very sweet, yet makes the worst
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.362"/>
							
							liquor in the world. For it is not the inequality in the
							parts that affects the smooth part, but what is cold and
							raw is contracted by heat. And salt helps to produce
							the same effect; for it is hot, and works in opposition to
							the uniting of the parts just mentioned, causing rather a
							dissolution; for to it, above all other things, Nature has
							given a dissolving faculty. Therefore the fig-tree sends
							forth a hot and sharp spirit, which cuts and boils the flesh
							of the bird. The very same thing may be effected by
							placing the flesh upon a heap of corn, or near nitre; the
							heat will produce the same that the fig-tree did. Now it
							may be made manifest that wheat is naturally hot, in that
							wine, put into a hogshead and placed among wheat, is
							presently consumed.</p>

							be ignorant of that of which Plato the philosopher was.
							Though Alcaeus may be defended; for it is probable that
							the lungs, lying near the stomach, may participate of the
							steam of the liquor, and be drenched with it. But the
							philosopher, expressly delivering that most part of our
							drink passeth through the lungs, hath precluded all ways
							of excuse to those that would be willing to defend him.
							For it is a very great and complicated ignorance; for first,
							it being necessary that our liquid and dry food should be
							mixed, it is very probable that the stomach is the vessel
							for them both, which throws out the dry food after it is
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.364"/>
							
							grown soft and moist into the guts. Besides, the lungs
							being a dense and compacted body, how is it possible that,
							when we sup gruel or the like, the thicker parts should

							Erasistratus rationally made against Plato. Besides, when
							he considered for what end every part of the body was
							made, and what use Nature designed in their contrivance,
							it was easy to perceive that the epiglottis was framed on
							purpose that when we drink the wind-pipe should be shut,
							and nothing be suffered to fall upon the lungs. For if
							any thing by chance gets down that way, we are troubled
							with retching and coughing till it is thrown up again.
							And this epiglottis being framed so that it may fall on
							either side, whilst we speak it shuts the weasand, but when
							we eat or drink it falls upon the wind-pipe, and so secures
							the passage for our breath. Besides, we know that those
							who drink by little and little are looser than those who
							drink greedily and large draughts; for in the latter the

							stays, and by its stay is mixed with and moistens the meat
							thoroughly. Now this could not be, if in the very drinking the liquid was separated from the food; but the effect

                  </p>
                  <p>shows that he saw better and clearer than Erasistratus.
							For he saw that the lungs have cavities and pores, through
							which the liquids pass. For the breath in expiration hath
							no need of pores, but that the liquids and those things
							which pass with them might go through, it is made like a
							strainer and full of pores. Besides, sir, as to the influence
							of gruel which you proposed, the lungs can discharge themselves of the thicker parts together with the thin, as well
							as the stomach. For our stomach is not, as some fancy,
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.366"/>
							
							smooth and slippery, but full of asperities, in which it is
							probable that the thin and small particles are lodged, and
							so not taken quite down. But neither this nor the other
							can we positively affirm; for the curious contrivance of
							Nature in her operations is too hard to be explained; nor
							can we be particularly exact upon those instruments (I
							mean the spirit and the heat) which she makes use of in
							her works. But besides those we have mentioned to confirm Plato's opinion, let us produce Philistion of Locri, a
							very ancient and famous physician, and Hippocrates too,
							with his pupil Dioxippus; for they thought of no other
							passage but that which Plato mentions. Dioxippus knew
							very well that precious talk of the epiglottis, but says,
							that when we feed, the moist parts are about that separated from the dry, and the first are carried down the windpipe, the other down the weasand; and that the windpipe
							receives no parts of the food, but the stomach, together
							with the dry parts, receives some portion of the liquids.
							And this is probable, for the epiglottis lies over the windpipe, as a fence and strainer, that the drink may get in by
							little and little, lest descending in a large full stream, it
							stop the breath and endanger the life. And therefore
							birds have no epiglottis, because they do not sup or lap
							when they drink, but take up a little in their beak, and let
							it run gently down their windpipe.</p>
                  <p>These testimonies I think are enough; and reason confirms Plato's opinion by arguments drawn first from sense.
							For when the windpipe is wounded, no drink will go down;
							but as if the pipe were broken it runs out, though the
							weasand be whole and unhurt. And all know that in the
							inflammation of the lungs the patient is troubled with extreme thirst; the heat or dryness or some other cause,
							together with the inflammation, making the appetite intense. But a stronger evidence than all these follows.
							Those creatures that have very small lungs, or none at all,
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.367"/>
							
							neither want nor desire drink, because to some parts there
							belongs a natural appetite to drink, and those that want
							those parts have no need to drink, nor any appetite to be
							supplied by it. But more, the bladder would seem unnecessary; for, if the weasand receives both meat and drink
							and conveys it to the belly, the superfluous parts of the
							liquids would not want a proper passage, one common one
							would suffice as a canal for both that were conveyed to the
							same vessel by the same passage. But now the bladder is
							distinct from the guts, because the drink goes from the
							lungs, and the meat from the stomach; they being separated as we take them down. And this is the reason that
							in our water nothing can be found that either in smell or
							color resembles dry food. But if the drink were mixed
							with the dry meat in the belly, it must be impregnant with
							its qualities, and not come forth so simple and untinged.
							Besides, a stone is never found in the stomach, though it
							is likely that the moisture should be coagulated there as
							well as in the bladder, if all the liquor were conveyed
							through the weasand into the belly. But it is probable that
							the weasand robs the windpipe of a sufficient quantity of
							liquor as it is going down, and useth it to soften and concoct the meat. And therefore its excrement is never purely
							liquid; and the lungs, disposing of the moisture, as of the
							breath, to all the parts that want it, deposit the superfluous position in the bladder. And I am sure that this is a
							much more probable opinion than the other. But which
							is the truth cannot perhaps be discovered, and therefore it
							is not fit so peremptorily to find fault with the most acute
							and most famed philosopher, especially when the matter is
							so obscure, and the Platonists can produce such considerable reasons for their opinion.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>WE had always some difficulty started about <foreign lang="greek">kerasbo/los</foreign>

						certain that some, thinking that those seeds which fall on
						the oxen's horns bear fruit which is very hard, did by a
						metaphor call a stiff untractable fellow by these names),
						but what was the cause that seeds falling on the oxen's
						horns should bear hard fruit. I had often desired my
						friends to search no farther, most of all fearing the discourse of Theophrastus, in which he has collected many
						of those particulars whose causes we cannot discover.
						Such are the hen's purifying herself with straw after she
						has laid, the seal's swallowing her rennet when she is
						caught, the deer's burying his cast horns, and the goat's
						stopping the whole herd by holding a branch of sea-holly
						in his mouth; and among the rest he reckoned this is a
						thing of which we are certain, but whose cause it is very
						difficult to find. But once at supper at Delphi, some of
						my companions&mdash;as if we were not only better counsellors when our bellies are full (as one hath it), but wine
						would make us brisker in our enquiries and bolder in our
						resolutions&mdash;desired me to speak somewhat to that problem.</p>

                  <p>I refused, though I had some excellent men on my

						they had gathered both from husbandry and hunting; for
						instance, that those officers that are appointed to watch the

						blood or a woman's rags; that a wild fig being bound
						to a garden fig-tree will keep the fruit from falling, and
						promote their ripening; that deer when they are taken
						shed salt tears, and boars sweet. But if you have a mind
						to such questions, Euthydemus will presently desire you to
						give an account of smallage and cummin; one of the

                  <p>This last Florus thought to be an idle foolery; but

						a solution of the other proposed difficulties.</p>
                  <p>In my opinion it is cold that causes this hardness in corn
							and pulse, by contracting and constipating their parts till
							the substance becomes close and extremely rigid; while
							heat is a dissolving and softening quality. Therefore those
							that cite this verse against Homer,
							<quote rend="blockquote">The season, not the field, bears fruit,</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>do not justly reprehend him. For fields that are warm by
							nature, the air being likewise temperate, bear more mellow
							fruit than others. And therefore those seeds that fall immediately on the earth out of the sower's hand, and are
							covered presently, and cherished by being covered, partake
							more of the moisture and heat that is in the earth. But
							those that strike against the oxen's horns do not enjoy
							what Hesiod calls the best position, but seem to be scattered rather than sown; and therefore the cold either destroys them quite, or else, lighting upon them as they lie
							naked; condenseth their moisture, and makes them hard
							and woody. Thus stones that lie under ground and plant-animals have softer parts than those that lie above; and
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.370"/>
							
							therefore stone-cutters bury the stones they would work, as
							if they designed to have them prepared and softened by the
							heat; but those that lie above ground are by the cold made
							hard, rigid, and very hurtful to the tools. And if corn
							lies long upon the floor, the grains become much harder
							than that which is presently carried away. And sometimes too a cold wind blowing whilst they winnow spoils
							the corn, as it hath happened at Philippi in Macedonia;
							and the chaff secures the grains whilst on the floor. For
							is it any wonder that husbandmen affirm, one ridge will
							bear soft and fruitful, and the very next to it hard and unfruitful corn? Or&mdash;which is stranger&mdash;that in the same
							bean-cod some beans are of this sort, some of the other, as
							more or less wind and moisture falls upon this or that?

               <head>Question III.
						<lb/> WHY THE MIDDLE OF WINE, THE TOP OF OIL, AND THE BOTTOM OF HONEY IS BEST.
						<lb/> ALEXION, PLUTARCH, OTHERS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>MY father-in-law Alexion laughed at Hesiod, for advising us to drink freely when the barrel is newly broached
						or almost out, but moderately when it is about the middle,
						since there is the best wine. For who, said he, doth not
						know, that the middle of wine, the top of oil, and the
						bottom of honey is the best? Yet he bids us spare the
						middle, and stay till worse wine runs, when the barrel is
						almost out. This said, the company minded Hesiod no
						more, but began to enquire into the cause of this difference.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>We were not at all puzzled about the honey, everybody almost knowing that that which is lightest is so because it is rare, and that the heaviest parts are dense and
						compact, and by reason of their weight settle below the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.371"/>
						
						others. So, if you turn over the vessel, each in a little
						time will recover its proper place, the heavier subsiding,
						and the lighter rising above the rest. And as for the
						wine, probable solutions presently appeared; for its
						strength consisting in heat, it is reasonable that it should
						be contained chiefly in the middle, and there best preserved; for the lower parts the lees spoil, and the upper
						are impaired by the neighboring air. For that the air will
						impair wine no man doubts, and therefore we usually bury
						or cover our barrels, that as little air as can be might come
						near them. Besides (which is an evident sign) a barrel
						when full is not spoiled so soon as when it is half empty;
						because a great deal of air getting into the empty space
						troubles and disturbs  liquor, whereas the wine that is
						in the full cask is preserved and defended by itself, not
						admitting much of the external air, which is apt to injure
						and corrupt it.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>But the oil puzzled us most. One of the company
						thought that the bottom of the oil was worst, because it
						was foul and troubled with the lees; and that the top was
						not really better than the rest, but only seemed so, because
						it was farthest removed from those corrupting particles.
						Others thought the thickness of the liquor to be the reason, which thickness keeps it from mixing with other humids, unless blended together and shaken violently; and
						therefore it will not mix with air, but keeps it off by its
						smoothness and close contexture, so that it hath no power
						to corrupt it. But Aristotle seems to be against this opinion, who hath observed that oil grows sweeter by being
						kept in vessels not exactly filled, and afterwards ascribes
						this melioration to the air; for more air, and therefore more
						powerful to produce the effect, flows into a vessel not well
						filled.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>Well then! said I, the same quality in the air may
						spoil wine, and better oil. For long keeping improves
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.372"/>
						
						wine, but spoils oil. Now the air keeps oil from growing
						old; for that which is cooled continues fresh and new, but
						that which is kept close up, having no way to exhale its
						corrupting parts, presently decays, and grows old. Therefore it is probable that the air coming upon the superficies
						of the oil keepeth it fresh and new. And this is the reason that the top of wine is worst, and of oil best; because
						age betters the one, and spoils the other.

               <head>Question IV.
						<lb/> WHAT WAS THE REASON OF THAT CUSTOM OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS TO REMOVE THE TABLE BEFORE ALL THE MEAT WAS EATEN, AND NOT TO PUT OUT THE LAMP?
						<lb/> FLORUS, EUSTROPHUS, CAESERNIUS, LUCIUS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>FLORUS, who loved the ancient customs, would not
						let the table be removed quite empty, but always left some
						meat upon it; declaring likewise that his father and grandfather were not only curious in this matter, but would never
						suffer the lamp after supper to be put out,&mdash;a thing about
						which the ancient Romans were very precise,&mdash;while
						those of the present day extinguish it immediately after
						supper, that they may lose no oil. Eustrophus the Athenian being present said: What could they get by that, unless they knew the cunning trick of our Polycharmus, who,
						after long deliberation how to find out a way to prevent the
						servants' stealing of the oil, at last with a great deal of
						difficulty happened upon this: As soon as you have put
						out the lamp, fill it up, and the next morning look carefully whether it remains full. Then Florus with a smile
						replied: Well, since we are agreed about that, let us enquire for what reason the ancients were so careful about
						their tables and their lamps.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>First, about the lamps. And his son-in-law Caesernius
						was of opinion that the ancients abominated all extinction
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.373"/>
						
						of fire, because of the relation it had to the sacred and
						eternal flame. Fire, like man, may be destroyed two ways,
						either when it is violently quenched, or when it naturally
						decays. The sacred fire was secured against both ways,
						being always watched and continually supplied; but the
						common fire they permitted to go out of itself, not forcing
						or violently extinguishing it, but not supplying it with
						nourishment, like a useless beast, that they might not feed
						it to no purpose.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Lucius, Florus's son, subjoined, that all the rest of the
						discourse was very good, but that they did not reverence
						and take care of this holy fire because they thought it
						better or more venerable than other fire; but, as amongst
						the Egyptians some worship the whole species of dogs,
						wolves, or crocodiles, yet keep but one wolf, dog, or crocodile (for all could not be kept), so the particular care which
						the ancients took of the sacred fire was only a sign of the
						respect they had for all fires. For nothing bears such a
						resemblance to an animal as fire. It is moved and nourished by itself, and by its brightness, like the soul, discovers
						and makes every thing apparent; but in its quenching it
						principally shows some power that seems to proceed from
						our vital principle, for it makes a noise and resists, like
						an animal dying or violently slaughtered. And can you
						(looking upon me) offer any better reason?</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>I can find fault, replied I, with no part of the discourse, yet I would subjoin, that this custom is an instruction for kindness and good-will. For it is not lawful for
						any one that hath eaten sufficiently to destroy the remainder
						of the food; nor for him that hath supplied his necessities
						from the fountain to stop it up; nor for him that hath
						made use of any marks, either by sea or land, to ruin or
						deface them; but every one ought to leave those things
						that may be useful to those persons that afterwards may
						have need of them. Therefore it is not fit, out of a saving
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.374"/>
						
						covetous humor, to put out a lamp as soon as we need it
						not; but we ought to preserve and let it burn for the use
						of those that perhaps want its light. Thus, it would be
						very generous to lend our ears and eyes, nay, if possible,
						our reason and fortitude, to others, whilst we are idle
						or asleep. Besides, consider whether to stir up men to
						gratitude these minute observances were practised. The
						ancients did not act absurdly when they highly reverenced
						an oak. The Athenians called one fig-tree sacred, and forbade any one to cut down an olive. For such observances
						do not (as some fancy) make men prone to superstition,
						but persuade us to be communicative and grateful to one
						another, by being accustomed to pay this respect to these
						senseless and inanimate creatures. Upon the same reason
						Hesiod, methinks, adviseth well, who would not have any
						meat or broth set on the table out of those pots out of which
						there had been no portion offered, but ordered the first-fruits to be given to the fire, as a reward for the service it
						did in preparing it. And the Romans, dealing well with
						the lamps, did not take away the nourishment they had
						once given, but permitted them to live and shine by it.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="5">
                  <p>When I had said thus, Eustrophus subjoined: This
						gives us some light into that query about the table; for
						they thought that they ought to leave some portion of the
						supper for the servants and waiters, for those are not so
						well pleased with a supper provided for them apart, as with
						the relics of their master's table. And upon this account,
						they say, the Persian king did not only send portions from
						his own table to his friends, captains, and gentlemen of
						his bed-chamber, but had always what was provided for
						his servants and his dogs served up to his own table; that
						as far as possible all those creatures whose service was
						useful might seem to be his guests and companions. For,
						by such feeding in common and participation, the wildest
						of beasts might be made tame and gentle.</p>
                  <pb id="v.3.p.375"/>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="6">
                  <p>Then I with a smile said: But, sir, that fish there,
						that according to the proverb is laid up, why do not we
						bring out into play together with Pythagoras's choenix,
						which he forbids any man to sit upon, thereby teaching us
						that we ought to leave something of what we have before
						us for another time, and on the present day be mindful of
						the morrow? We Boeotians use to have that saying frequently in our mouths, <q direct="unspecified"> Leave something for the Medes,</q>
						ever since the Medes overran and spoiled Phocis and the
						marches of Boeotia; but still, and upon all occasions, we
						ought to have that ready, <q direct="unspecified"> Leave something for the guests
							that may come.</q> And therefore I must needs find fault
						with that always empty and starving table of Achilles; for,
						when Ajax and Ulysses came ambassadors to him, he had
						nothing ready, but was forced out of hand to dress a fresh
						supper. And when he would entertain Priam, he again
						bestirs himself, kills a white ewe, joints and dresses it, and
						in that work spent a great part of the night. But Eumaeus
						(a wise scholar of a wise master) had no trouble upon him
						when Telemachus came home, but presently desired him
						to sit down, and feasted him, setting before him dishes of
						boiled meat,

                  <p>But if this seems trifling, and a small matter, I am sure it

               <div3 type="section" n="7">
                  <p>Lucius subjoining said, that he had heard his grandmother say, that the table was sacred, and nothing that is
						sacred ought to be empty. Besides, continued he, in my
						opinion, the table hath some resemblance of the earth; for,
						besides nourishing us, it is round and stable, and is fitly
						called by some Vesta (<foreign lang="greek">(*esti/a</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">i(/sthmi'</foreign>). Therefore as we

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AT the Pythian games Callistratus, procurator of the

						that music was more intoxicating than wine to those that
						wantonly and unskilfully use it. For they were not content to sit still and applaud and clap, but many at last

						that those belong peculiarly to man, and of other pleasures beasts have a share. For I am certain that a great
						many irrational creatures are delighted with music, as
						deer with pipes; and to mares, whilst they are horsing,
						they play a tune called <foreign lang="greek">i(ppo/qoros</foreign>. And Pindar says, that his

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Upon this discourse of Callistratus, my father Lamprias, seeing the musicians grow bolder, said: That is not
						the reason, sir, and, in my opinion, the ancients were much
						out when they named Bacchus the son of Forgetfulness.
						They ought to have called him his father; for it seems he
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.378"/>
						
						hath made you forget that some of those faults which are
						committed about pleasures proceed from a loose intemperate inclination, and others from heedlessness or ignorance.
						Where the ill effect is very plain, there intemperate inclination captivates reason, and forces men to sin; but
						where the just reward of intemperance is not directly and
						presently inflicted, there ignorance of the danger and heedlessness make men easily wrought on and secure. Therefore those that are vicious, either in eating, drinking, or
						venery, which diseases, wasting of estates, and evil reports
						usually attend, we call intemperate. For instance, Theodectes, who having sore eyes, when his mistress came to
						see him, said,
						<quote rend="blockquote">All hail, delightful light;</quote>

                  <p>Now those that take all care possible to secure themselves

							we do not in like manner call loose and intemperate, since

							not taken which hath all its other gates secured by bars,
							portcullises, and chains, if the enemies are already entered through one and have taken possession; or fancy
							ourselves invincible against the assaults of pleasure, because stews will not provoke us, when the music-meeting
							or theatre prevails. For in one case as much as the other
							we resign up our souls to the impetuousness of pleasures,
							which pouring in those potions of songs, cadences, and
							tunes, more powerful and bewitching than the best mixtures of the skilful cook or perfumer, conquer and corrupt
							us; and in the mean time, by our own confession, as it
							were, the fault is chiefly ours. Now, as Pindar saith, nothing that the earth and sea hath provided for our tables can
							be justly blamed, nor doth it change; but neither our
							meat nor broth, nor this excellent wine which we drink,
							hath raised such a noisy tumultuous pleasure as those
							songs and tunes did, which not only filled the house with
							clapping and shouting, but perhaps the whole town. Therefore we ought principally to secure ourselves against such
							delights, because they are more powerful than others; as
							not being terminated in the body, like those which allure
							the touch, taste, or smelling, but affecting the very intellectual and judging faculties. Besides, from most other
							delights, though reason doth not free us, yet other passions
							very commonly divert us. Sparing niggardliness will keep
							a glutton from dainty fish, and covetousness will confine a
							lecher from a costly whore. As in one of Menander's

                  </p>
                  <p>For to pay interest for money is a severe punishment that

							entertainer, but by some others of the guests, a question
							was started, from whom that custom began. Some thought
							from Socrates, who persuaded Aristodemus, who was not
							invited, to go along with him to Agatho's, where there
							happened a pretty jest. For Socrates by accident staying
							somewhat behind, Aristodemus went in first; and this
							seemed very fitting, for, the sun shining on their backs,
							the shadow ought to go before the body. Afterwards it
							was thought necessary at all entertainments, especially of
							great men, when the inviter did not know their favorites
							and acquaintance, to desire the invited to bring his company, appointing such a set number, lest they should be
							put to the same shifts which he was put to who invited
							King Philip to his country-house. The king came with a
							numerous attendance, but the provision was not equal to
							the company. Therefore, seeing his entertainer much cast
							down, he sent some about to tell his friends privately, that
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.382"/>
							
							they should keep one corner of their bellies for a great
							cake that was to come. And they, expecting this, fed

                  <p>When I had talked thus waggishly to the company,
						Florus had a mind to talk gravely concerning these

						following Hesiod's advice,
						<quote rend="blockquote">Invite a friend to feast,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Works and Days, 342.</note>

                  <p>or at least we should have our acquaintance and familiars
							to participate of our entertainments, mirth, and discourse
							over a glass of wine; but now, as ferry-men permit their
							passengers to bring in what fardel they please, so we permit others to fill our entertainments with any persons, let
							them be good companions or not. And I should wonder
							that any man of breeding being so (that is, not at all) invited, should go; since, for the most part, he must be
							unacquainted with the entertainer, or if he was acquainted,
							was not thought worthy to be bidden. Nay, he should be
							more ashamed to go to such a one, if he considers that it
							will look like an upbraiding of his unkindness, and yet a
							rude intruding into his company against his will. Besides,
							to go before or after the guest that invites him must look
							unhandsomely, nor is it creditable to go and stand in need
							of witnesses to assure the guests that he doth not come as
							a principally invited person, but such a one's shadow.
							Beside, to attend others bathing or anointing, to observe
							his hour, whether he goes early or late, is servile and
							gnathonical (for there never was such an excellent fellow as
							Gnatho to feed at another man's table). Besides, if there

							intruder? For whether he is free or not, he lies open to
							the exception of the company. Besides, the very meanness and vileness of the name is no small evil to those
							who do not resent but can quietly endure to be called
							and answer to the name of shadows. For, by enduring
							such base names, men are insensibly customed and drawn
							on to base actions. Therefore, when I make an invitation,
							since it is hard to break the custom of a place, I give my

               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>A short silence followed this discourse; then Florus
						began thus: This last thing you mentioned, sir, is a greater
						difficulty than the other. For it is necessary when we
						invite our friends to give them liberty to choose their own
						shadows, as was before hinted; for to entertain them without their friends is not very obliging, nor is it very easy to
						know whom the person we invite would be most pleased
						with. Then said I to him: Consider therefore whether
						those that give their friends this license to invite do not at
						the same time give the invited license to accept the invitation and come to the entertainment. For it is not fit either
						to permit or to desire another to do that which is not
						decent to be done, or to urge and persuade to that which
						no man ought to be persuaded or to consent to do. When
						we entertain a great man or stranger, there we cannot
						invite or choose his company, but must receive those that
						come along with him. But when we treat a friend, it will
						be more acceptable if we ourselves invite all, as knowing
						his acquaintance and familiars; for it tickles him extremely
						to see that others take notice that he hath chiefly a respect
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.384"/>
						
						for such and such, loves their company most, and is well
						pleased when they are honored and invited as well as he.
						Yet sometimes we must deal with our friend as petitioners
						do when they make addresses to a God; they offer vows to
						all that belong to the same altar and the same shrine,
						though they make no particular mention of their names.
						For no dainties, wine, or ointment can incline a man to
						merriment, as much as a pleasant agreeable companion.
						For as it is rude and ungenteel to enquire and ask what
						sort of meat, wine, or ointment the person whom we are
						to entertain loves best; so it is never disobliging or absurd
						to desire him who hath a great many acquaintance to bring
						those along with him whose company he likes most, and
						in whose conversation he can take the greatest pleasure.
						For it is not so irksome and tedious to sail in the same
						ship, to dwell in the same house, or be a judge upon the
						same bench, with a person whom we do not like, as to be
						at the same table with him; and the contrary is equally
						pleasant. An entertainment is a communion of serious or
						merry discourse or actions; and therefore, to make a merry
						company, we should not pick up any person at a venture,
						but take only such as are known to one another and
						sociable. Cooks, it is true, mix sour and sweet juices,
						rough and oily, to make their sauces; but there never was
						an agreeable table or pleasant entertainment where the
						guests were not all of a piece, and all of the same humor.
						Now, as the Peripatetics say, the first mover in nature
						moves only and is not moved, and the last moved is moved
						only but does not move, and between these there is that
						which moves and is moved by others; so there is the same
						analogy between those three sorts of persons that make
						up a company,&mdash;there is the simple inviter, the simple
						invited, the invited that invites another. We have spoken
						already concerning the inviter, and it will not be improper,
						in my opinion, to deliver my sentiments about the other
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.385"/>
						
						two. He that is invited and invites others, should, in my
						opinion, be sparing in the number that he brings. He
						should not, as if he were to forage in an enemy's country,
						carry all he can with him; or, like those who go to possess
						a new-found land, by the excessive number of his own
						friends, incommode or exclude the friends of the inviter,
						so that the inviter must be in the same case with those that
						set forth suppers to Hecate and the Gods who avert evil,
						of which neither they nor any of their family partake,
						except of the smoke and trouble. It is true they only
						speak in waggery that say,
						<quote rend="blockquote">

                  </p>
                  <p>But the same thing really happens to him who entertains
							ill-bred guests or friends, who with a great many shadows,
							as it were harpies, tear and devour his provision. Besides,
							he should not take anybody that he may meet along with him
							to another's entertainment, but chiefly the entertainer's acquaintance, as it were contending with him and preventing
							him in the invitation. But if that cannot be effected, let
							him carry such of his own friends as the entertainer would
							choose himself; to a civil modest man, some of complaisant
							humor; to a learned man, ingenious persons; to a man
							that hath borne office, some of the same rank; and, in short,
							such whose acquaintance he hath formerly sought and
							would be now glad of. For it will be extremely pleasing
							and obliging to bring such into company together; but one
							who brings to a feast men who have no conformity at all
							with the feast-maker, but who are perfect aliens and
							strangers to him,&mdash;as hard drinkers to a sober man,&mdash;
							gluttons and sumptuous persons to a temperate thrifty
							entertainer,&mdash;or to a young, merry, boon companion,
							grave old philosophers solemnly talking through their
							beards,&mdash;will be very disobliging, and turn all the intended mirth into an unpleasant sourness. The entertained
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.386"/>
							
							 should be as obliging to the entertainer as the entertainer to the entertained; and then he will be most obliging, when not only he himself, but all those that come by
							his means, are pleasant and agreeable.</p>
                  <p>The last of the three which remains to be spoken of is
							he that is invited by one man to another's feast. Now he
							that disdains and is much offended at the name of a shadow
							will appear to be afraid of a mere shadow. But in this
							matter there is need of a great deal of caution, for it is not
							creditable readily to go along with every one and to everybody. But first you must consider who it is that invites;
							for if he is not a very familiar friend, but a rich or great
							man, such who, as if upon a stage, wants a large or splendid retinue, or such who thinks that he puts a great obligation upon you and does you a great deal of honor by this
							invitation, you must presently deny. But if he is your
							friend and particular acquaintance, you must not yield upon
							the first motion: but if there seems a necessity for some
							conversation which cannot be put off till another time, or
							if he is lately come from a journey or designs to go on
							one, and out of mere good-will and affection seems desirous
							of your company, and doth not desire to carry a great
							many strangers but only some few friends along with
							him; or, besides all this, if he designs to bring you thus
							invited acquainted with the principal inviter, who is very
							worthy of your acquaintance, then consent and go. For
							as to ill-humored persons, the more they seize and take
							hold of us like thorns, we should endeavor to free ourselves from them or leap over them the more. If he that
							invites is a civil and well-bred person, yet doth not design
							to carry you to one of the same temper, you must refuse,
							lest you should take poison in honey, that is, get the acquaintance of a bad man by an honest friend. It is absurd
							to go to one you do not know, and with whom you never
							had any familiarity, unless, as I said before, the person be
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.387"/>
							
							an extraordinary man, and, by a civil waiting upon him at
							another man's invitation, you design to begin an acquaintance with him. And those friends you should chiefly go
							to as shadows, who would come to you again in the same
							quality. To Philip the jester, indeed, he seemed more
							ridiculous that came to a feast of his own accord than he
							that was invited; but to well-bred and civil friends it is
							more obliging for men of the same temper to come at the
							nick of time with other friends, when uninvited and unexpected; at once pleasing both to those that invite and
							those that entertain. But chiefly you must avoid going to
							rulers, rich or great men, lest you incur the deserved
							censure of being impudent, saucy, rude, and unseasonably
							ambitious.

               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>AT Chaeronea, Diogenianus the Pergamenian being
							present, we had a long discourse at an entertainment about
							music; and we had a great deal of trouble to hold out
							against a great bearded sophister of the Stoic sect, who
							quoted Plato as blaming a company that admitted flute-girls
							and were not able to entertain one another with discourse.
							And Philip the Prusian, of the same sect, said: Those
							guests of Agatho, whose discourse was more sweet than
							the sound of any pipe in the world, were no good authority
							in this case; for it was no wonder that in their company
							the flute-girl was not regarded; but it is strange that, in
							the midst of the entertainment, the extreme pleasantness
							of the discourse had not made them forget their meat and
							drink. Yet Xenophon thought it not indecent to bring in
							to Socrates, Antisthenes, and the like the jester Philip; as
							Homer doth an onion to make the wine relish. And Plato
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.388"/>
							
							brought in Aristophanes's discourse of love, as a comedy,
							into his entertainment; and at the last, as it were drawing
							all the curtains, he shows a scene of the greatest variety
							imaginable,&mdash;Alcibiades drunk, frolicking, and crowned.
							Then follows that pleasant raillery between him and Socrates concerning Agatho, and the encomium of Socrates;
							and when such discourse was going on, good Gods! had it
							not been allowable, if Apollo himself had come in with his
							harp ready, to desire the God to forbear till the argument
							was out? These men, having such a pleasant way of discoursing, used these arts and insinuating methods, and
							graced their entertainments by facetious raillery. But shall
							we, being mixed with tradesmen and merchants, and some
							(as it now and then happens) ignorants and rustics, banish
							out of our entertainments this ravishing delight, or fly the
							musicians, as if they were Sirens, as soon as we see them
							coming? Clitomachus the wrestler, rising and getting
							away when any one talked of love, was much wondered
							at; and should not a philosopher that banisheth music
							from a feast, and is afraid of a musician, and bids his linkboy presently light his link and be gone, be laughed at,
							since he seems to abominate the most innocent pleasures,
							as beetles do ointment? For, if at any time, certainly over
							a glass of wine, music should be allowed, and then chiefly
							the harmonious God should have the direction of our
							souls; so that Euripides, though I like him very well in
							other things, shall never persuade me that music, as he
							would have it, should be applied to melancholy and grief.
							For there sober and serious reason, like a physician, should
							take care of the diseased men; but those pleasures should
							be mixed with Bacchus, and serve to increase our mirth
							and frolic. Therefore it was a pleasant saying of that
							Spartan at Athens, who, when some new tragedians were
							to contend for the prize, seeing the preparations of the
							masters of the dances, the hurry and busy diligence of the
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.389"/>
							
							instructors, said, the city was certainly mad which sported
							with so much pains. He that designs to sport should
							sport, and not buy his ease and pleasure with great expense, or the loss of that time which might be useful to
							other things; but whilst he is feasting and free from business, those should be enjoyed. And it is advisable to try
							amidst our mirth, whether any profit is to be gotten from
							our delights.

                  <p>WHEN Philip had ended, I hindered the sophister
						from returning an answer to the discourse, and said: Let
						us rather enquire, Diogenianus, since there are a great
						many sorts of music, which is fittest for an entertainment.
						And let us beg this learned man's judgment in this case;
						for since he is not prejudiced or apt to be biassed by any
						sort, there is no danger that he should prefer that which is
						pleasantest before that which is best. Diogenianus joining with me in this request, he presently began. All
						other sorts I banish to the theatre and play-house, and can
						only allow that which hath been lately admitted into the
						entertainments at Rome, and with which everybody is not
						yet acquainted. You know, continued he, that some of
						Plato's dialogues are purely narrative, and some dramatic.
						The easiest of this latter sort they teach their children to
						speak by heart; causing them to imitate the actions of
						those persons they represent, and to form their voice and
						affections to be agreeable to the words. This all the grave
						and well-bred men exceedingly approve; but soft and effeminate fellows, whose ears ignorance and ill-breeding
						hath corrupted, and who, as Aristoxenus phraseth it, are
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.390"/>
						
						ready to vomit when they hear excellent harmony, reject
						it; and no wonder, when effeminacy prevails.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Philip, perceiving some of the company uneasy at
						this discourse, said: Pray spare us, sir, and be not so severe upon us ; for we were the first that found fault with
						that custom when it first began to be countenanced in
						Rome, and reprehended those who thought Plato fit to entertain us whilst we were making merry, and who would
						hear his dialogues whilst they were eating cates and scattering perfumes. When Sappho's songs or Anacreon's
						verses are pronounced, I protest I then think it decent to
						set aside my cup. But should I proceed, perhaps you
						would think me much in earnest, and designing to oppose
						you, and therefore, together with this cup which I present
						my friend, I leave it to him to wash your salt ear with
						fresh discourse.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Then Diogenianus, taking the cup, said: Methinks
						this is very sober discourse, which makes me believe that
						the wine doth not please you, since I see no effect of it;
						so that I fear I ought to be corrected. Indeed many sorts
						of music are to be rejected; first, tragedy, as having nothing familiar enough for an entertainment, and being a representation of actions attended with grief and extremity
						of passion. I reject the sort of dancing which is called
						Pyladean from Pylades, because it is full of pomp, very
						pathetical, and requires a great many persons; but if we
						would admit any of those sorts that deserve those encomiums which Socrates mentions in his discourse about dancing, I like that sort called Bathyllean, which requires not
						so high a motion, but hath something of the nature of the
						Cordax, and resembles the motion of an Echo, a Pan, or a
						Satyr frolicking with love. Old comedy is not fit for men
						that are making merry, by reason of the irregularities that
						appear in it; for that vehemency which they use in the
						parabasis is loud and indecent, and the liberty they take to
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.391"/>
						
						scoff and abuse is very surfeiting, too open, and full of
						filthy words and lewd expressions. Besides, as at great
						men's tables every man hath a servant waiting at his elbow,
						so each of his guests would need a grammarian to sit by
						him, and explain who is Laespodias in Eupolis, Cinesias
						in Plato, and Lampo in Cratinus, and who is each person
						that is jeered in the play. Concerning new comedy there
						is no need of any long discourse. It is so fitted, so interwoven with entertainments, that it is easier to have a regular feast without wine, than without Menander. Its phrase
						is sweet and familiar, the humor innocent and easy, so that
						there is nothing for men whilst sober to despise, or when
						merry to be troubled at. The sentiments are so natural
						and unstudied, that midst wine, as it were in fire, they
						soften and bend the rigidest temper to be pliable and easy.
						And the mixture of gravity and jests seems to be contrived for nothing so aptly as for the pleasure and profit of
						those that are frolicking and making merry. The love-scenes in Menander are convenient for those who have
						already taken their cups, and who in a short time must
						retire home to their wives; for in all his plays there is no
						love of boys mentioned, and all rapes committed on virgins
						end decently in marriages at last. As for misses, if they
						are impudent and jilting, they are bobbed, the young gallants turning sober, and repenting of their lewd courses.
						But if they are kind and constant, either their true parents
						are discovered, or a time is determined for the intrigue,
						which brings them at last to obliging modesty and civil
						kindness. These things to men busied about other matters
						may seem scarce worth taking notice of; but whilst they
						are making merry, it is no wonder that the pleasantness
						and smoothness of the parts should work a neat conformity and elegance in the hearers, and make their manners
						like the pattern they have from those genteel characters.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>Diogenianus, either designedly or for want of breath,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.392"/>
						
						ended thus. And when the sophister came upon him again,
						and contended that some of Aristophanes's verses should
						be recited, Philip speaking to me said: Diogenianus hath
						had his wish in praising his beloved Menander, and seems
						not to care for any of the rest. There are a great many
						sorts which we have not at all considered, concerning
						which I should be very glad to have your opinion; and
						the prize for carvers we will set up to-morrow, when we
						are sober, if Diogenianus and this stranger think fit. Of
						representations, said I, some are mythical, and some are
						farces; neither of these are fit for an entertainment; the
						first by reason of their length and cost, and the latter
						being so full of filthy discourse and lewd actions, that they
						are not fit to be seen by the foot-boys that wait on civil
						masters. Yet the rabble, even with their wives and young
						sons, sit quietly to be spectators of such representations as
						are apt to disturb the soul more than the greatest debauch
						in drink. The harp ever since Homer's time was well acquainted with feasts and entertainments, and therefore it
						is not fitting to dissolve such an ancient friendship and acquaintance; but we should only desire the harpers to forbear their sad notes and melancholy tunes, and play only
						those that are delighting, and fit for such as are making
						merry. The pipe, if we would, we cannot reject, for the
						libation in the beginning of the entertainment requires that
						as well as the garland. Then it insinuates and passeth
						through the ears, spreading even to the very soul a pleasant sound, which produceth serenity and calmness; so
						that, if the wine hath not quite dissolved or driven away
						all vexing solicitous anxiety, this, by the softness and delightful agreeableness of its sound, smooths and calms the
						spirits, if so be that it keeps within due bounds, and doth
						not elevate too much, and, by its numerous surprising divisions, raise an ecstasy in the soul which wine hath weakened and made easy to be perverted. For as brutes do
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.393"/>
						
						not understand a rational discourse, yet lie down or rise up
						at the sound of a shell or whistle, or of a chirp or clap; so
						the brutish part of the soul, which is incapable either of
						understanding or obeying reason, men conquer by songs
						and tunes, and by music reduce it to tolerable order. But
						to speak freely what I think, no pipe nor harp simply
						played upon, and without a song with it, can be very fit for
						an entertainment. For we should still accustom ourselves
						to take our chiefest pleasure from discourse, and spend our
						leisure time in profitable talk, and use tunes and airs as a
						sauce for the discourse, and not singly by themselves, to
						please the unreasonable delicacy of our palate. For as
						nobody is against pleasure that ariseth from sauce or wine
						going in with our necessary food, but Socrates flouts and
						refuseth to admit that superfluous and vain pleasure which
						we take in perfumes and odors at a feast; thus the sound
						of a pipe or harp, when singly applied to our ears, we utterly reject, but if it accompanies words, and together
						with an ode feasts and delights our reason, we gladly introduce it. And we believe the famed Marsyas was punished by Apollo for pretending, when he had nothing but
						his single pipe, and his muzzle to secure his lips, to contend with the harp and song of the God. Let us only take
						care that, when we have such guests as are able to cheer
						one another with philosophy and good discourse, we do
						not introduce any thing that may rather prove an uneasy
						hindrance to the conversation than promote it. For not
						only are those fools, who, as Euripides says, having safety
						at home and in their own power, yet would hire some from
						abroad; but those too who, having pleasantness enough
						within, are eager after some external pastimes to comfort
						and delight them. That extraordinary piece of honor
						which the Persian king showed Antalcidas the Spartan
						seemed rude and uncivil, when he dipped a garland composed of crocus and roses in ointment, and sent it him to
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.394"/>
						
						wear, by that dipping putting a slight upon and spoiling
						the natural sweetness and beauty of the flowers. He
						doth as bad, who having a Muse in his own breast, and all
						the pleasantness that would fit an entertainment, will have
						pipes and harps play, and by that external adventitious
						noise destroy all the sweetness that was proper and his
						own. But in short, all ear-delights are fittest then, when
						the company begins to be disturbed, fall out, and quarrel, for then they may prevent raillery and reproach, and
						stop the dispute that is running on to sophistical and unpleasant wrangling, and bridle all babbling declamatory
						altercations, so that the company maybe freed of noise and
						quietly composed.

						<pb id="v.3.p.396"/>
						
						by a glass of wine, make the mind irresolute and inconstant. Therefore as a bed is more convenient for a man
						whilst making merry than a chair, because it contains the
						whole body and keeps it from all disturbing motion, so it
						is best to have the soul perfectly at quiet; or, if that cannot be, we must give it, as to children that will be doing,
						not a sword or spear, but a rattle or ball,&mdash;in this following the example of the God himself, who puts into the
						hands of those that are making merry a ferula, the lightest
						and softest of all weapons, that, when they are most apt to
						strike, they may hurt least. Over a glass of wine men
						should make only ridiculous slips, and not such as may
						prove tragical, lamentable, or of any considerable concern.
						Besides, in serious debates, it is chiefly to be considered,
						that persons of mean understanding and unacquainted with
						business should be guided by the wise and experienced;
						but wine destroys this order. Insomuch that Plato says,
						wine is called <foreign lang="greek">oi)=nos</foreign>, because it makes those that drink it
						think that they have wit (<foreign lang="greek">oi)/esqai nou=n e)/xen</foreign>); for none over a
						glass of wine thinks himself so noble, beauteous, or rich
						(though he fancies himself all these), as wise; and therefore wine is babbling, full of talk, and of a dictating humor;
						so that we are rather for being heard than hearing, for
						leading than being led. But a thousand such objections
						may be raised, for they are very obvious. But let us hear
						which of the company, either old or young, can allege any
						thing for the contrary opinion.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Then said my brother cunningly: And do you imagine that any, upon a sudden, can produce any probable
						reasons? And Nicostratus replying, Yes, no doubt, there
						being so many learned men and good drinkers in company;
						he with a smile continued: Do you think, sir, you are fit
						to treat of these matters, when wine hath disabled you to
						discourse politics and state affairs? Or is not this all the
						same as to think that a man in his liquor doth not see
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.397"/>
						
						very well nor understand those that talk and discourse with
						him, yet hears the music and the pipers very well? For
						as it is likely that useful and profitable things draw and
						affect the sense more than fine and gaudy; so likewise they
						do the mind. And I shall not wonder that the nice philosophical speculation should escape a man who hath drunk
						freely; but yet, I think, if he were called to political debates, his wisdom would become more strong and vigorous.
						Thus Philip at Chaeronea, being well heated, talked very
						foolishly, and was the sport of the whole company; but as
						soon as they began to discourse of a truce and peace, he
						composed his countenance, contracted his brows, and dismissing all vain, empty, and dissolute thoughts, gave an
						excellent, wise, and sober answer to the Athenians. To
						drink freely is different from being drunk, and those that
						drink till they grow foolish ought to retire to bed. But as
						for those that drink freely and are otherwise men of sense,
						why should we fear that they will fail in their understanding or lose their skill, when we see that musicians play
						as well at a feast as in a theatre? For when skill and art
						are in the soul, they make the body correct and proper in
						its operations, and obedient to the motions of the mind.
						Besides, wine inspirits some men, and raises a confidence
						and assurance in them, but not such as is haughty and
						odious, but pleasing and agreeable. Thus they say that
						Aeschylus wrote his tragedies over a bottle; and that all
						his plays (though Gorgias thought that one of them, the
						Seven against Thebes, was full of Mars) were Bacchus's.
						For wine (according to Plato), heating the soul together
						with the body, makes the body pliable, quick, and active,
						and opens the passages; while the fancies draw in discourse
						with boldness and daring.</p>
                  <p>For some have a good natural invention, yet whilst they
							are sober are too diffident and too close, but midst their
							wine, like frankincense, exhale and open at the heat. Besides,
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.398"/>
							
							 wine expels all fear, which is the greatest hindrance
							to all consultations, and quencheth many other degenerate
							and lazy passions; it opens the rancor and malice, as it
							were, the two-leaved doors of the soul, and displays the
							whole disposition and qualities of any person in his discourse. Freedom of speech, and, through that, truth it
							principally produceth; which once wanting, neither quickness of wit nor experience availeth any thing; and many
							proposing that which comes next rather hit the matter,
							than if they warily and designedly conceal their present
							sentiments. Therefore there is no reason to fear that wine
							will stir up our affections; for it never stirs up the bad,
							unless in the worst men, whose judgment is never sober.
							But as Theophrastus used to call the barbers' shops wineless entertainments; so there is a kind of an uncouth wineless drunkenness always excited either by anger, malice,
							emulation, or clownishness in the souls of the unlearned.
							Now wine, blunting rather than sharpening many of these
							passions, doth not make them sots and foolish, but simple
							and guileless ; not negligent of what is profitable, but desirous of what is good and honest. Now those that think craft
							to be cunning, and vanity or closeness to be wisdom, have
							reason to think those that over a glass of wine plainly and
							ingenuously deliver their opinions to be fools. But on the
							contrary, the ancients called the God the Freer and Loosener, and thought him considerable in divination; not, as
							Euripides says, because he makes men raging mad, but because he looseth and frees the soul from all base distrustfull fear, and puts them in a condition to speak truth fully
							and freely to one another.</p>

                  <p>THOSE, my Sossius Senecio, who throw philosophy out of
						entertainments do worse than those who take away a light.
						For the candle being removed, the temperate and sober
						guests will not become worse than they were before, being
						more concerned to reverence than to see one another. But
						if dulness and disregard to good learning wait upon the
						wine, Minerva's golden lamp itself could not make the
						entertainment pleasing and agreeable. For a company to
						sit silent and only cram themselves is, in good truth, swinish
						and almost impossible. But he that permits men to talk,
						yet doth not allow set and profitable discourses, is much
						more ridiculous than he who thinks that his guests should
						eat and drink, yet gives them foul wine, unsavory and
						nastily prepared meat. For no meat nor drink which is
						not prepared as it ought to be is so hurtful and unpleasant
						as discourse which is carried round in company insignificantly and out of season. The philosophers, when
						they would give drunkenness a vile name, call it doting by
						wine. Now doting is to use vain and trifling discourse;
						and when such babbling is accompanied by wine, it usually
						ends in most disagreeable and rude contumely and reproach.
						It is a good custom therefore of our women, who in their
						feasts called Agrionia seek after Bacchus as if he were
						run away, but in a little time give over the search, and cry
						that he is fled to the Muses and lurks with them; and
						some time after, when supper is done, put riddles and hard
						questions to one another. For this mystery teaches us,
						that midst our entertainments we should use learned and
						philosophical discourse, and such as hath a Muse in it;

                  <p>ON the sixth day of May we celebrated Socrates's

						Ion, said he, was happy in his expression, when he said

						things very much like her; and that she seemed to have
						some order and design, not only in placing the nativities of
						these two philosophers so near together, but in setting first
						the birthday of the most famous of the two, who was also
						the teacher of the other. I had a great deal to say to the
						company concerning some notable things that fell out on
						the same day, as concerning the time of Euripides's birth
						and death; for he was born the same day that the Greeks
						beat Xerxes by sea at Salamis, and died the same day that
						Dionysius the elder, the Sicilian tyrant, was born,&mdash;Fortune
						(as Timaeus hath it) at the same time taking out of the
						world a representer, and bringing into it a real actor, of
						tragedies. Besides, we remembered that Alexander the
						king and Diogenes the Cynic died upon the same day.
						And all agreed that Attalus the king died on his own birthday. And some said, that Pompey the great was killed in
						Egypt on his birthday, or, as others will have it, a day
						before. We remember Pindar also, who, being born at
						the time of the Pythian games, made afterwards a great
						many excellent hymns in honor of Apollo.</p>

							For that implies a change and passion; as Alexander imagined, when he said that he knew himself to be mortal
							as often as he lay with a woman or slept. For sleep is a
							relaxation of the body, occasioned by the weakness of our
							nature; and all generation is a corruptive parting with
							some of our own substance. But yet I take heart again,

							things; not as if he parted with any seed, but as if by his
							power he implanted a generative principle in matter, which

						<lb/> WHAT IS PLATO'S MEANING, WHEN HE SAYS THAT GOD ALWAYS PLAYS THE GEOMETER?
						<lb/> DIOGENIANUS, TYNDARES, FLORUS, AUTOBULUS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>SILENCE following this discourse, Diogenianus began
						and said: Since our discourse is about the Gods, shall we,
						especially on his own birthday, admit Plato to the conference, and enquire upon what account he says (supposing it
						to be his sentence) that God always plays the geometer?
						I said that this sentence was not plainly set down in any of
						his books; yet there are good arguments that it is his, and
						it is very much like his expression. Tyndares presently
						subjoining said: Perhaps, Diogenianus, you imagine that
						this sentence intimates some curious and difficult speculation, and not that which he hath so often mentioned, when
						he praiseth geometry as a science that takes off men from
						sensible objects, and makes them apply themselves to the
						intelligible and eternal Nature, the contemplation of which
						is the end of philosophy, as a view of the mysteries of
						initiation into holy rites. For the nail of pain and
						pleasure, that fastens the soul to the body, seems to do
						us the greatest mischief, by making sensible things more
						powerful over us than intelligible, and by forcing the understanding
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.403"/>
						
						 to determine rather according to passion than
						reason. For the understanding, being accustomed by the
						vehemency of pain or pleasure to be intent on the mutable
						and uncertain body, as if it really and truly were, grows
						blind as to that which really is, and loses that instrument
						and light of the soul, which is worth a thousand bodies,
						and by which alone the Deity can be discovered. Now in
						all sciences, as in plain and smooth mirrors, some marks
						and images of the truth of intelligible objects appear, but
						in geometry chiefly; which, according to Philo, is the chief
						and principal of all, and doth bring back and turn the
						understanding, as it were, purged and gently loosened from
						sense. And therefore Plato himself dislikes Eudoxus,
						Archytas, and Menaechmus for endeavoring to bring down
						the doubling the cube to mechanical operations; for by
						this means all that was good in geometry would be lost
						and corrupted, it falling back again to sensible things, and
						not rising upward and considering immaterial and immortal
						images, in which God being versed is always God.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>After Tyndares, Florus, a companion of his, who always jocosely pretended to be his admirer, said thus: Sir,
						we are obliged to you for making your discourse not proper
						to yourself, but common to us all; for you have made
						it possible to refute it by demonstrating that geometry is
						not necessary to the Gods, but to us. Now the Deity doth
						not stand in need of science, as an instrument to withdraw
						his intellect from things engendered and to turn it to the
						real things; for these are all in him, with him, and about
						him. But pray consider whether Plato, though you do
						not apprehend it, doth not intimate something that is
						proper and peculiar to you, mixing Lycurgus with Socrates, as much as Dicaearchus thought he did Pythagoras.
						For Lycurgus, I suppose you know, banished out of Sparta
						all arithmetical proportion, as being democratical and
						favoring the crowd; -but introduced the geometrical, as
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.404"/>
						
						agreeable to an oligarchy and kingly government that rules
						by law; for the former gives an equal share to every one
						according to number, but the other gives according to the
						proportion of the deserts. It doth not huddle all things
						together, but in it there is a fair discretion of good and
						bad, every one having what is fit for him, not by lot or
						weight, but according as he is virtuous or vicious. The
						same proportion, my dear Tyndares, God introduceth,
						which is called <foreign lang="greek">di/kh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign>, and which teacheth us to
						account that which is just equal, and not that which is
						equal just. For that equality which many affect, being
						often the greatest injustice, God, as much as possible, takes
						away; and useth that proportion which respects every man's
						deserts, geometrically defining it according to law and
						reason.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>This exposition we applauded; and Tyndares, saying
						he envied him, desired Autobulus to engage Florus and
						confute his discourse. That he refused to do, but produced another opinion of his own. Geometry, said he,
						considers nothing else but the accidents and properties of
						the extremities or limits of bodies; neither did God make
						the world any other way than by terminating matter, which
						was infinite before. Not that matter was really infinite
						as to either magnitude or multitude; but the ancients used
						to call that infinite which by reason of its confusion and
						disorder is undetermined and unconfined. Now the terms
						of every thing that is formed or figured are the form and
						figure of that thing, without which the thing would be
						formless and unfigured. Now numbers and proportions
						being applied to matter, it is circumscribed and as it were
						bound up by lines, and through lines by surfaces and profundities; and so were settled the first species and differences of bodies, as foundations from which to raise the
						four elements, fire, air, water, and earth. For it was impossible that, out of an unsteady and confused matter, the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.405"/>
						
						equality of the sides, the likeness of the angles, and the
						exact proportion of octahedrons, icosahedrons, pyramids,
						and cubes should be deduced, unless by some power that
						terminated and shaped every particle of matter. Therefore, terms being fixed to that which was undetermined or
						infinite before, the whole became and still continues agreeable in all parts, and excellently terminated and mixed;
						the matter indeed always affecting an indeterminate state,
						and flying all geometrical confinement, but proportion terminating and circumscribing it, and dividing it into several
						differences and forms, out of which all things that arise

						you despise yourselves (I continued) and altogether look
						for some external explication, attend to an exposition upon
						this sentence, which your masters very much approve.
						Amongst the most geometrical theorems, or rather problems, this is one: Two figures being given, to construct a
						third, which shall be equal to one and similar to the other.
						And it is reported that Pythagoras, upon the discovery of
						this problem, offered a sacrifice to the Gods; for this is a
						much more exquisite theorem than that which lays down,
						that the square of the hypothenuse in a right-angled triangle is equal to the squares of the two sides. Right,
						said Diogenianus, but what is this to the present question?
						You will easily understand, I replied, if you call to mind
						how Timaeus divides that which gave the world its beginning into three parts. One of which is justly called God,
						the other matter, and the third form. That which is called
						matter is the most confused subject, the form the most
						beautiful pattern, and God the best of causes. Now this
						cause, as far as possible, would leave nothing infinite and
						indeterminate, but adorn Nature with number, measure,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.406"/>
						
						and proportion, making one thing of all the subjects
						together, equal to the matter, and similar to the form.
						Therefore proposing to himself this problem, he made
						and still makes a third, and always preserves it equal to
						the matter, and like the form; and that is the world.
						And this world, being in continual changes and alterations
						because of the natural necessity of body, is helped and
						preserved by the father and maker of all things, who by
						proportion terminates the substance according to the pattern. Wherefore in its measure and circuit this universal
						world is more beautiful than that which is merely similar
						to it....

						<lb/> WHY NOISES ARE BETTER HEARD IN THE NIGHT THAN THE DAY.
						<lb/> AMMONIUS, BOETHUS, PLUTARCH, THRASYLLUS, ARISTODEMUS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>WHEN we supped with Ammonius at Athens, who
						was then the third time captain of the city-bands, there
						was a great noise about the house, some without doors
						calling, Captain! Captain! After he had sent his officers
						to quiet the tumult, and had dispersed the crowd, we began
						to enquire what was the reason that those that are within
						doors hear those that are without, but those that are without cannot hear those that are within as well. And Ammonius said, that Aristotle had given a reason for that
						already; for the sound of those within, being carried
						without into a large tract of air, grows weaker presently
						and is lost; but that which comes in from without is not
						subject to the like casualty, but is kept close, and is therefore more easy to be heard. But that seemed a more difficult question, Why sounds seem greater in the night than
						in the day, and yet altogether as clear. For my own part
						(continued he) I think Providence hath very wisely contrived that our hearing should be quickest when our sight
						can do us very little or no service; for the air of the <q direct="unspecified">blind
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.407"/>
							
							and solitary Night,</q> as Empedocles calls it, being dark, supplies in the ears that defect of sense which it makes in
						the eyes. But since of natural effects we should endeavor
						to find the causes, and to discover what are the material
						and mechanical principles of things is the proper task
						of a natural philosopher, who shall first assist us with a
						rational account hereof?</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Boethus began, and said: When I was a novice in
						letters, I then made use of geometrical postulates, and
						assumed as undoubted truths some undemonstrated suppositions; and now I shall make use of some propositions
						which Epicurus hath demonstrated already. Bodies move
						in a vacuum, and there are a great many spaces interspersed among the atoms of the air. Now when the air
						being rarefied is more extended, so as to fill the empty
						space, there are but few vacuities scattered and interspersed among the particles of matter; but when the atoms
						of air are condensed and laid close together, they leave a
						vast empty space, convenient and sufficient for other bodies
						to pass through. Now the coldness of the night makes
						such a constipation. Heat opens and separates the parts
						of condensed bodies. Therefore bodies that boil, grow
						soft, or melt, require a greater space than before; but on
						the contrary, the parts of the body that are condensed or
						freeze are contracted closer to one another, and leave those
						vessels and places from which they retired partly empty.
						Now the voice, meeting and striking against a great many
						bodies in its way, is either altogether lost or scattered, and
						very much and very frequently hindered in its passage;
						but when it hath a plain and smooth way through an
						empty space, and comes to the ear uninterrupted, the passage is so sudden, that it preserves its articulate distinctness, as well as the words it carries. You may observe
						that empty vessels, when knocked, answer presently, send
						out a noise to a great distance, and oftentimes the sound
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.408"/>
						
						whirled round in the hollow breaks out with a considerable
						force; whilst a vessel that is filled either with a liquid or a
						solid body will not answer to a stroke, because the sound
						hath no room or passage to come through. And among
						solid bodies themselves, gold and stone, because they want
						pores, can hardly be made to sound; and when a noise is
						made by a stroke upon them, it is very flat, and presently
						lost. But brass is sounding, it being a porous, rare, and
						light metal, not consisting of parts closely compacted, but
						being mixed with a yielding and uncompacted substance,
						which gives free passage to other motions, and kindly receiving the sound sends it forward; till some touching the
						instrument do, as it were, seize on it in the way, and stop
						the hollow; for then, by reason of the hindering force, it
						stops and goes no farther. And this, in my opinion, is the
						reason why the night is more sonorous, and the day less;
						since in the day, the heat rarefying the air makes the empty
						spaces between the particles to be very little. But, pray,
						let none argue against the suppositions I first assumed.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>And I (Ammonius bidding me oppose him) said: Sir,
						your suppositions which require a vacuum to be granted I
						shall admit; but you err in supposing that a vacuum is
						conducive either to the preservation or conveyance of
						sound. For that which cannot be touched, acted upon, or
						struck is peculiarly favorable to silence. But sound is a
						stroke of a sounding body; and a sounding body is that
						which is homogeneous and uniform, easy to be moved,
						light, smooth, and, by reason of its tenseness and continuity, obedient to the stroke; and such is the air. Water,
						earth, and fire, are of themselves soundless; but each of
						them makes a noise when air falls upon or gets into it.
						And brass hath in it no vacuum; but being mixed with
						a smooth and gentle air it answers to a stroke, and is
						sounding. If the eye may be judge, iron must be reckoned
						to have a great many vacuities, and to be porous like a
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.409"/>
						
						honey-comb, yet it is the dullest, and sounds worse than
						any other metal.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is no need to trouble the night to contract and condense its air, that in other parts we may leave
							vacuities and wide spaces; as if the air would hinder and
							corrupt the substance of the sounds, whose very substance,
							form, and power itself is. Besides, if your reason held,
							misty and extreme cold nights would be more sonorous
							than those which are temperate and clear, because then
							the atoms in our atmosphere are constipated, and the spaces
							which they left remain empty; and, what is more obvious,
							a cold day should be more sonorous than a warm summer's
							night; neither of which is true. Therefore, laying aside
							that explication, I produce Anaxagoras, who teacheth that
							the sun makes a tremulous motion in the air, as is evident
							from those little motes which are seen tossed up and down
							and flying in the sunbeams. These (says he), being in the
							day-time whisked about by the heat, and making a humming noise, lessen or drown other sounds; but at night
							their motion, and consequently their noise, ceaseth.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>When I had thus said, Ammonius began: Perhaps
						it will look like a ridiculous attempt in us, to endeavor to
						confute Democritus and correct Anaxagoras. Yet we must
						not allow that humming noise to Anaxagoras's little motes,
						for it is neither probable nor necessary. But their tremulous and whirling motion in the sunbeams is oftentimes
						sufficient to disturb and break a sound. For the air (as
						hath been already said), being itself the body and substance
						of sound, if it be quiet and undisturbed, gives a straight,
						easy, and continuous way to the particles or the motions
						which make the sound. Thus sounds are best heard in
						calm still weather; and the contrary is seen in tempestuous
						weather, as Simonides hath it:&mdash;

                  <p>THE Isthmian games being celebrated, when Sospis
						was the second time director of the solemnity, we avoided
						other entertainments,&mdash;he treating a great many strangers,
						and often all his fellow-citizens,&mdash;but once, when he entertained his nearest and most learned friends at his own
						house, I was one of the company. After the first course,
						one coming to Herodes the rhetorician brought a palm and
						a wreathed crown, which one of his acquaintance, who
						had won the prize for an encomiastic exercise, sent him.
						This Herodes received very kindly, and sent it back again,
						but added that he could not tell the reason why, since each
						of the games gave a particular garland, yet all of them
						bestowed the palm. For those do not satisfy me (said he)
						who say that the equality of the leaves is the reason, which
						growing out one against another seem to resemble some
						striving for the prize, and that victory is called <foreign lang="greek">ni/kh</foreign> from
						<foreign lang="greek">mh\ ei)/kein</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">not to yield.</hi> For a great many other trees, which
						almost by measure and weight divide the nourishment to
						their leaves growing opposite to one another, show a decent
						order and wonderful equality. They seem to speak more
						probably who say the ancients were pleased with the beauty and figure of the tree. Thus Homer compares Nausicaa
						to a palm-branch. For you all know very well, that some
						threw roses at the victors, and some pomegranates and
						apples, to honor and reward them. But now the palm
						hath nothing evidently more taking than many other things,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.412"/>
						
						since here in Greece it bears no fruit that is good to eat, it
						not ripening and growing mature enough. But if, as in
						Syria and Egypt, it bore a fruit that is the most pleasant to
						the eyes of any thing in the world, and the sweetest to the
						taste, then I must confess nothing could compare with it,
						And the Persian monarch (as the story goes), being extremely taken with Nicolaus the Peripatetic philosopher,
						who was a very sweet-humored man, tall and slender, and
						of a ruddy complexion, called the greatest and fairest dates
						Nicolai.</p>

                  <p>This discourse of Herodes seemed to give occasion for
						a query about Nicolaus, which would be as pleasant as the
						former. Therefore, said Sospis, let every one carefully
						give his sentiments of the matter in hand. I begin, and
						think that, as far as possible, the honor of the victor
						should remain fresh and immortal. Now a palm-tree
						is the longest lived of any, as this line of Orpheus testifies:
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">They lived like branches of a leafy palm.</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this almost alone enjoys the privilege (though it is
							said to belong to many beside) of having always fresh and
							the same leaves. For neither the laurel nor the olive nor the
							myrtle, nor any other of those trees called evergreen, is always seen with the very same leaves; but as the old fall,
							new ones grow. So cities continue the same, where new
							parts succeed those that decay. But the palm, never
							shedding a leaf, is continually adorned with the same
							green. And this power of the tree, I believe, men think
							agreeable to, and fit to represent, the strength of victory.</p>

						as belonging to Amphictyon. For there they first, in honor of the God, crowned the victors with laurel and palm,
						as consecrating to the God, not the laurel or olive, but the
						palm. So Nicias did, who defrayed the charges of the
						solemnity in the name of the Athenians at Delos; the Athenians themselves at Delphi; and before these, Cypselus
						the Corinthian. For this God is a lover of games, and

						leads the way), keep close to our subject, the palm-tree,

						Babylonians celebrate this tree, as being useful to them
						three hundred and sixty several ways. But to us Greeks
						it is of very little use, but its want of fruit makes it proper
						for contenders in the games. For being the fairest,
						greatest, and best proportioned of all sorts of trees, it
						bears no fruit amongst us; but by reason of its strong constitution it spends all its nourishment (like an athlete)
						upon its body, and so has very little, and that very bad, remaining for seed. Beside all this, it hath something peculiar, which cannot be attributed to any other tree. The
						branch of a palm, if you put a weight upon it, doth not
						yield and bend downwards, but turns the contrary way, as
						if it resisted the pressing force. The like is to be observed in these exercises. For those who, through weakness or cowardice, yield to them, their adversaries oppress;

               <head>Question V.
						<lb/> WHY THOSE THAT SAIL UPON THE NILE TAKE UP THE WATER THEY ARE TO USE BEFORE DAY.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>ONE demanded a reason why the sailors take up the
							water for their occasions out of the river Nile by night, and
							not by day. Some thought they feared the sun, which
							heating the water would make it more liable to putrefaction. For every thing that is heated or warmed becomes
							more easy to be changed, having already suffered when its
							proper quality was remitted. And cold constipating the
							parts seems to preserve every thing in its natural state,
							and water especially. For that the cold of water is naturally constringent is evident from snow, which keeps flesh
							from corrupting a long time. And heat, as it destroys the
							proper quality of other things, so of honey, for it being
							boiled is itself corrupted, though when raw it preserves
							other bodies from corruption. And that this is the cause,
							I have a very considerable evidence from standing pools;
							for in winter they are as wholesome as other water, but in
							summer they grow bad and noxious. Therefore the night
							seeming in some measure to resemble the winter, and the
							day the summer, they think the water that is taken up at
							night is less subject to be vitiated and changed.</p>
                  <p>To these seemingly probable reasons another was added,
							which confirmed the ingenuity of the sailors by a very
							natural proof. For some said that they took up their
							water by night because then it was clear and undisturbed;
							but at daytime, when a great many fetched water together,
							and many boats were sailing and many beasts swimming
							upon the Nile, it grew thick and muddy, and in that
							condition it was more subject to corruption. For mixed
							bodies are more easily corrupted than simple and unmixed; for from mixture proceeds disagreement of the
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.416"/>
							
							parts, from that disagreement a change, and corruption is
							nothing else but a certain change; and therefore painters
							call the mixing of their colors <foreign lang="greek">fqora/s</foreign>, <hi rend="italics">corrupting;</hi> and Homer expresseth dyeing by <foreign lang="greek">mih=nai</foreign> (to <hi rend="italics">stain</hi> or <hi rend="italics">contaminate</hi>).
							Commonly we call any thing that is simple and unmixed
							incorruptible and immortal. Now earth being mixed with
							water soonest corrupts its proper qualities, and makes it
							unfit for drinking; and therefore standing water stinks
							soonest, being continually filled with particles of earth,
							whilst running waters preserve themselves by either leaving behind or throwing off the earth that falls into them.
							And Hesiod justly commends
							
							<quote rend="blockquote">The water of a pure and constant spring.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Works and Days, 595.</note>
                     </quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>For that water is wholesome which is not corrupted, and
							that is not corrupted which is pure and unmixed. And
							this opinion is very much confirmed from the difference of
							earths; for those springs that run through a mountainous,
							rocky ground are stronger than those which are cut through
							plains or marshes, because they do not take off much earth.
							Now the Nile running through a soft country, like the
							blood mingled with the flesh, is filled with sweet juices
							that are strong and very nourishing; yet it is thick and
							muddy, and becomes more so if disturbed. For motion
							mixeth the earthly particles with the liquid, which, because
							they are heavier, fall to the bottom as soon as the water is
							still and undisturbed. Therefore the sailors take up the
							water they are to use at night, by that means likewise
							preventing the sun, which always exhales and consumes
							the subtler and lighter particles of the liquid.

						<foreign lang="greek">trexe/deipnos</foreign> signified one that was too late for supper; because,
						when he found himself tardy, he mended his pace, and
						made more than common haste. And he told us a jest of

                  <p>And I said, that Polycharmus, a leading orator at

						<lb/> CONCERNING PYTHAGORAS'S SYMBOLS, IN WHICH HE FORBIDS US TO
						RECEIVE A SWALLOW INTO OUR HOUSE, AND BIDS US AS SOON AS WE ARE RISEN TO RUFFLE THE BEDCLOTHES.
						<lb/> SYLLA, LUCIUS, PLUTARCH, PHILINUS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>SYLLA the Carthaginian, upon my return to Rome
						after a long absence, gave me a welcoming supper, as the
						Romans call it, and invited some few other friends, and
						among the rest, one Lucius an Etrurian, the scholar of
						Moderatus the Pythagorean. He seeing my friend Philinus
						ate no flesh, began (as the opportunity was fair) to talk of
						Phythagoras; and affirmed that he was a Tuscan, not because his father, as others have said, was one, but because
						he himself was born, bred, and taught in Tuscany. To
						confirm this, he brought considerable arguments from such
						symbols as these:&mdash;As soon as you are risen, ruffle the
						bedclothes; leave not the print of the pot in the ashes;
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.420"/>
						
						receive not a swallow into your house; never step over a
						besom; nor keep in your house creatures that have hooked
						claws. For these precepts of the. Pythagoreans the Tuscans only, as he said, carefully observe.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Lucius having thus said, that precept about the swallow seemed to be most unaccountable, it being a harmless
						and kind animal; and therefore it seemed strange that that
						should be forbid the house, as well as the hooked-clawed
						animals, which are ravenous, wild, and bloody. Nor did
						Lucius himself approve that only interpretation of the
						ancients, who say, this symbol aims directly at backbiters
						and tale-bearing whisperers. For the swallow whispers
						not at all; it chatters indeed, and is noisy, but not more
						than a pie, a partridge, or a hen. What then, said Sylla,
						is it upon the old fabulous account of killing her son, that
						they deny the swallow entertainment, by that means showing their dislike to those passions which (as the story goes)
						made Tereus and Procne and Philomel act and suffer such
						wicked and abominable things? And even to this day they
						call the birds Daulides. And Gorgias the sophister, when
						a swallow muted upon him, looked upon her and said,
						Philomel, this was not well done. Or perhaps this is all
						groundless; for the nightingale, though concerned in the
						same tragedy, we willingly receive.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Perhaps, sir, said I, what you have alleged may be
						some reason; but pray consider whether first they do not
						hate the swallow upon the same account that they abhor
						hook-clawed animals. For the swallow feeds on flesh; and
						grasshoppers, which are sacred and musical, they chiefly
						devour and prey upon. And, as Aristotle observes, they
						fly near the surface of the earth to pick up the little animals. Besides, that alone of all house-animals makes no
						return for her entertainment. The stork, though she is
						neither covered, fed, nor defended by us, yet pays for the
						place where she builds, going about and killing the efts,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.421"/>
						
						snakes, and other venomous creatures. But the swallow,
						though she receives all those several kindnesses from us,
						yet, as soon as her young are fledged, flies away faithless
						and ungrateful; and (which is the worst of all) of all
						house-animals, the fly and the swallow only never grow
						tame, suffer a man to touch them, keep company with or
						learn of him. And the fly is so shy because often hunted
						and driven away; but the swallow naturally hates man,
						suspects, and dares not trust any that would tame her.
						And therefore,&mdash;if we must not look on the outside of
						these things, but opening them view the representations
						of some things in others,-Pythagoras, setting the swallow
						for an example of a wandering, unthankful man, adviseth
						us not to take those who come to us for their own need
						and upon occasion into our familiarity, and let them partake of the most sacred things, our house and fire.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>This discourse of mine gave the company encouragement to proceed, so they attempted other symbols, and
						gave moral interpretations of them. Philinus said, that
						the precept of blotting out the print of the pot instructed
						us not to leave any plain mark of anger, but, as soon as
						ever the passion hath done boiling, to lay aside all thoughts
						of malice and revenge. That symbol which adviseth us to
						ruffle the bedclothes seemed to some to have no secret
						meaning, but to be in itself very evident; for it is not
						decent that the impression and (as it were) stamped image
						should be left to be seen by others, in the place where a
						man hath lain with his wife. But Sylla thought the symbol was rather intended to prevent men's sleeping in the
						daytime, all the conveniences for sleeping being taken
						away in the morning as soon as we are up. For night is
						the time for sleep, and in the day we should rise and follow our affairs, and not suffer so much as the print of our
						body in the bed, since a man asleep is of no more use
						than one dead. And this interpretation seems to be confirmed
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.422"/>
						
						 by that other precept, in which the Pythagoreans
						advise their followers not to take off any man's burthen
						from him, but to lay on more, as not countenancing sloth
						and laziness in any.

               <head>Question VIII.
						<lb/> WHY THE PYTHAGOREANS COMMAND FISH NOT TO BE EATEN, MORE STRICTLY THAN OTHER ANIMALS.
						<lb/> EMPEDOCLES, SYLLA, LUCIUS, TYNDARES, NESTOR.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>OUR former discourse Lucius neither reprehended
						nor approved, but, sitting silent and musing, gave us the
						hearing. Then Empedocles addressing his discourse to
						Sylla, said: If our friend Lucius is displeased with the
						discourse, it is time for us to leave off; but if these are
						some of their mysteries which ought to be concealed, yet
						I think this may be lawfully divulged, that they more cautiously abstain from fish than from other animals. For
						this is said of the ancient Pythagoreans; and even now I
						have met with Alexicrates's scholars, who will eat and kill
						and even sacrifice some of the other animals, but will never
						taste fish. Tyndares the Spartan said, they spared fish
						because they had so great a regard for silence, and they
						called fish <foreign lang="greek">e)/llopas</foreign>, because they had their voice <hi rend="italics">shut up</hi>
						(<foreign lang="greek">i)llome/nhn</foreign>); and my namesake Empedocles advised one who
						left the school of Pythagoras to shut up his mind,... and
						they thought silence to be divine, since the Gods without
						any voice discover their meaning to the wise by their works.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>Then Lucius gravely and composedly saying, that perhaps the true reason was obscure and not to be divulged,
						yet they had liberty to venture upon probable conjectures,
						Theon the grammarian began thus: To demonstrate that
						Pythagoras was a Tuscan is a great and no easy task.
						But it is confessed that he conversed a long time with the
						wise men of Egypt, and imitated a great many of the rites
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.423"/>
						
						and institutions of the priests, for instance, that about
						beans. For Herodotus delivers, that the Egyptians neither
						set nor eat beans, nay, cannot endure to see them; and we
						all know, that even now the priests eat no fish; and the
						stricter sort eat no salt, and refuse all meat that is seasoned
						with it. Various reasons are given for this; but the
						only true reason is hatred to the sea, as being a disagreeable, or rather naturally a destructive element to man.
						For they do not imagine that the Gods, as the Stoics did
						that the stars, were nourished by it. But, on the contrary,
						they think that the father and preserver of their country,
						whom they call the deflux of Osiris, is lost in it; and when
						they bewail him as born on the left hand, and destroyed
						in the right-hand parts, they intimate to us the ending and
						corruption of their Nile by the sea. Therefore they do
						not believe that its water is wholesome, or that any creature produced or nourished in it can be clean or wholesome food for man, since it breathes not the common air,
						and feeds not on the same food with him. And the air
						that nourisheth and preserves all other things is destructive
						to them, as if their production and life were unnecessary
						and against Nature; nor should we wonder that they think
						animals bred in the sea to be disagreeable to their bodies,
						and not fit to mix with their blood and spirits, since when
						they meet a pilot they will not speak to him, because he
						gets his living by the sea.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Sylla commended this discourse, and added concerning the Pythagoreans, that they then chiefly tasted flesh
						when they sacrificed to the Gods. Now no fish is ever
						offered in sacrifice. I, after they had done, said that many,
						both philosophers and unlearned, considering with how
						many good things it furnisheth and makes our life more
						comfortable, take the sea's part against the Egyptians.
						But that the Pythagoreans should abstain from fish because
						they are not of the same kind, is ridiculous and absurd;
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.424"/>
						
						nay, to butcher and feed on other animals, because they
						bear a nearer relation to us, would be a most inhuman and
						Cyclopean return. And they say that Pythagoras bought
						a draught of fishes, and presently commanded the fishers
						to let them all out of the net; and this shows that he did
						not hate or not mind fishes, as things of another kind and
						destructive to man, but that they were his dearly beloved
						creatures, since he paid a ransom for their freedom.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the tenderness and humanity of those philosophers suggest a quite contrary reason, and I am apt to
							believe that they spare fishes to instruct men, or to accustom themselves to acts of justice; for other creatures generally give men cause to afflict them, but fishes neither do
							nor are capable of doing us harm. And it is easy to show,
							both from the writings and religion of the ancients, that
							they thought it a great sin not only to eat but to kill an
							animal that did them no harm. But afterwards, being
							necessitated by the spreading multitude of men, and commanded (as they say) by the Delphic oracle to prevent the
							total decay of corn and fruit, they began to sacrifice, yet
							they were so disturbed and concerned at the action, that
							they called it <foreign lang="greek">e)/rdein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">r(e/zein</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">to do</hi>), as if they did some
							strange thing in killing an animal; and they are very careful not to kill the beast before the wine has been thrown
							upon his head and he nods in token of consent. So very
							cautious are they of injustice. And not to mention other
							considerations, were no chickens (for instance) or hares
							killed, in a short time they would so increase that there
							could be no living. And now it would be a very hard
							matter to put down the eating of flesh, which necessity
							first introduced, since pleasure and luxury hath espoused
							it. But the water animals neither consuming any part of
							our air or water, or devouring the fruit, but as it were encompassed by another world, and having their own proper
							bounds, which it is death for them to pass, they afford our
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.425"/>
							
							belly no pretence at all for their destruction; and therefore
							to catch or be greedy after fish is plain deliciousness and
							luxury, which upon no just reason disturb the sea and dive
							into the deep. For we cannot call the mullet corn-destroying, the trout grape-eating, nor the barbel or sea-pike
							seed-gathering, as we do some land-animals, signifying
							their hurtfulness by these epithets. Nay, those little mischiefs which we complain of in these house-creatures, a
							weasel or fly, none can justly lay upon the greatest fish.
							Therefore the Pythagoreans, confining themselves not only
							by the law which forbids them to injure men, but also by
							Nature, which commands them to do violence to nothing,
							fed on fish very little, or rather not at all. But suppose
							there were no injustice in this case, yet to delight in fish
							would argue daintiness and luxury; because they are such
							costly and unnecessary diet. Therefore Homer doth not
							only make the Greeks eat no fish whilst encamped near
							the Hellespont, but he mentions not any sea-provision that
							the dissolute Phaeacians or luxurious wooers had, though
							both islanders. And Ulysses's mates, though they sailed
							over so much sea, as long as they had any provision left,
							never let down a hook or net.

							strange air, water, or food never tasted by the ancients,
							should descend to us out of other worlds or intermundane
							spaces. For we contract diseases from those very things
							which preserve our life; since there are no peculiar seeds
							of diseases, but the disagreement of their juices to our
							bodies, or our excess in using them, disturbs nature.
							These disturbances have still the very same differences,
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.428"/>
							
							though now and then called by new names. For names
							depend on custom, but the passions on Nature; and these
							being constant and those variable, this mistake has arisen.
							As, in the parts of a speech and the syntax of the words,
							it is possible for some new sort of barbarism or solecism
							suddenly to arise; so the temperature of the body hath
							certain deviations and corruptions into which it may fall,
							those things which are against and hurtful to Nature being
							in some sort contained in Nature herself. The mythographers are in this particular very ingenious, for they say
							that monstrous uncouth animals were produced in the time
							of the Giants' war, the moon being out of its course, and
							not rising where it used to do. And those who think
							Nature produces new diseases like monsters, and yet give
							neither likely nor unlikely reasons of the change, err, as I
							imagine, my dear Philo, in taking a less or a greater degree
							of the same disease to be a different disease. The intension or increase of a thing makes it more or greater, but
							does not make the subject of another kind. Thus the
							elephantiasis, being an intense scabbiness, is not a new
							kind; nor is the water-dread distinguished from other
							melancholic and stomachical affections but by the degree.
							And I wonder we did not observe that Homer was acquainted with this disease, for it is evident that he calls a
							dog rabid from the very same rage with which when men
							are possessed they are said to be mad.</p>

                  <p>Against this discourse of Diogenianus Philo himself
						made some objections, and desired me to be the old physicians' patron; who must be branded with inadvertency
						and ignorance, unless it appears that those diseases began
						since their time. First then Diogenianus, methinks, very
						precariously desires us to think that the intenseness or remissness of degrees is not a real difference, and does not
						alter the kind. For, were this true, then we should hold
						that downright vinegar is not different from pricked wine,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.429"/>
						
						nor a bitter from a rough taste, darnel from wheat, nor
						garden-mint from wild mint. For it is evident that these
						differences are only the degrees of the same qualities, in
						some being more intense, in some more remiss. So we
						should not venture to affirm that flame is different from a
						white spirit, daylight from flame, hoar-frost from dew, or
						hail from rain; but that the former have only more intense
						qualities than the latter. Besides, we should say that
						blindness is of the same kind with short-sightedness, violent vomiting (or cholera) with weakness of the stomach,
						and that they differ only in degree. Though what they
						say is nothing to the purpose; for if they admit the increase in intensity and vehemency, but declare that this
						came but now of late,&mdash;the novelty appearing in the
						quantity rather than the quality,&mdash;the same difficulties
						which they urged against the other opinion oppress them.
						Sophocles says very well concerning those things which

                  <p>And it is probable that not all diseases, as in a race, the
							barrier being let down, started together; but that one
							rising after another, at some certain time, had its beginning
							and showed itself. It is rational to conclude (continued I)
							that all diseases that rise from want, heat, or cold bear the
							same date with our bodies; but afterwards over-eating,
							luxury, and surfeiting, encouraged by ease and plenty,
							raised bad and superfluous juices, and those brought various new diseases, and their perpetual complications and
							mixtures still create more new. Whatever is natural is
							determined and in order; for Nature is order, or the work
							of order. Disorder, like Pindar's sand, cannot be comprised by number, and that which is beside Nature is
							straight called indeterminate and infinite. Thus truth is
							simple, and but one; but falsities innumerable. The exactness
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.430"/>
							
							 of motions and harmony are definite, but the errors
							either in playing upon the harp, singing, or dancing, who
							can comprehend? Indeed Phrynichus the tragedian says

                  </p>
                  <p>And Chrysippus says that the various complications of ten
							single axioms amount to 1,000,000. But Hipparchus hath
							confuted that account, showing that the affirmative contains 101,049 complicated propositions, and the negative
							310.952. And Xenocrates says, the number of syllables
							which the letters will make is 100,200,000. How then
							is it strange that the body, having so many different
							powers in itself, and getting new qualities every day from
							its meat and drink, and using those motions and alterations
							which are not always in the same time nor in the same
							order, should upon the various complications of all these
							be affected with new diseases? Such was the plague at
							Athens described by Thucydides, who conjectures that it
							was new because that birds and beasts of prey would not
							touch the dead carcasses. Those that fell sick about the
							Red Sea, if we believe Agatharcides, besides other strange
							and unheard diseases, had little serpents in their legs and
							arms, which did eat their way out, but when touched
							shrunk in again, and raised intolerable inflammations in
							the muscles; and yet this kind of plague, as likewise many
							others, never afflicted any beside, either before or since.
							One, after a long stoppage of urine, voided a knotty
							barley straw. And we know that Ephebus, with whom
							we lodged at Athens, threw out, together with a great deal
							of seed, a little hairy, many-footed, nimble animal. And
							Aristotle tells us, that Timon's nurse in Cilicia every year
							for two months lay in a cave, without any vital operation
							besides breathing. And in the Menonian books it is
							delivered as a symptom of a diseased liver carefully to
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.431"/>
							
							observe and hunt after mice and rats, which we see now
							nowhere practised.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us not wonder if something happens which
							never was before, or if something doth not appear among
							us with which the ancients were acquainted; for the cause
							of those accidents is the nature of our body, whose temperature is subject to be changed. Therefore, if Diogenianus will not introduce a new kind of water or air, we,
							having no need of it, are very well content. Yet we know
							some of Democritus's scholars affirm that, other worlds
							being dissolved, some strange effluvia fall into ours, and
							are the principle of new plagues and uncommon diseases.
							But let us not now take notice of the corruption of some
							parts of this world by earthquake, droughts, and floods,
							by which both the vapors and fountains rising out of the
							earth must be necessarily corrupted. Yet we must not
							pass by that change which must be wrought in the body
							by our meat, drink, and other exercises in our course of
							life. For many things which the ancients did not feed on
							are now accounted dainties; for instance mead and swine's
							paunch. Heretofore too, as I have heard, they hated the
							brain of animals so much, that they abominated the very
							name of it; as when Homer says, <q direct="unspecified">I value him at a brain's<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plutarch seems to give this meaning to the Homeric phrase <foreign lang="greek">e)nkaro\s ai)/sh|</foreign> (II.

								worth.</q> And even now we know some old men, that will
							not taste cucumber, melon, orange, or pepper. Now by
							these meats and drinks it is probable that the juices of our
							bodies are much altered, and their temperature changed,
							new qualities arising from this new sort of diet. And the
							change of order in our feeding having a great influence on
							the alteration of our bodies, the cold courses, as they were
							called formerly, consisting of oysters, sea-urchins, salads, and
							the like, being (in Plato's phrase) transferred <q direct="unspecified">from tail to
								mouth,</q> now make the first course, whereas they were
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.432"/>
							
							formerly the last. Besides, the glass which we usually take
							before supper is very considerable in this case; for the
							ancients never drank so much as water before they ate,
							but now we drink freely before we sit down, and fall to
							our meat with a full and heated body, using sharp sauces
							and pickles to provoke appetite, and then we fall greedily
							on the other meat. But nothing conduceth more to alterations and new diseases in the body than our various baths;
							for here the flesh, like iron in the fire, grows soft and loose,
							and is presently constipated and hardened by the cold.
							For, in my opinion, if any of the last age had looked into
							our baths, he might have justly said,
							
							<quote rend="blockquote">There burning Phlegethon meets Acheron.</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they used such mild gentle baths, that Alexander the
							Great being feverish slept in one. And the Gauls' wives
							carry their pots of pulse to eat with their children whilst

							and distress; and the air which we draw is a mixture of
							air and water, disturbs the whole body, tosses and displaces
							every atom, till we quench the fiery particles and allay
							their heat. Therefore, Diogenianus, you see that this account requires no new strange causes, no intermundane
							spaces; but the single alteration of our diet is enough to
							raise new diseases and abolish old.

						<lb/> WHY WE GIVE LEAST CREDIT TO DREAMS IN AUTUMN.
						<lb/> FLORUS, PLUTARCH, PLUTARCH'S SONS, FAVORINUS.</head>
               <div3 type="section" n="1">
                  <p>FLORUS reading Aristotle's physical problems, which
						were brought to him to Thermopylae, was himself (as
						philosophical wits used to be) filled with a great many
						doubts, and communicated them to others; thereby confirming Aristotle's saying, that much learning raises many
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.433"/>
						
						doubts. Other topics made our walks every day very
						pleasant, but the common saying concerning dreams,&mdash;
						that those in autumn are the vainest,&mdash;I know not how,
						whilst Favorinus was engaged in other matters, was started
						after supper. Your friends and my sons thought Aristotle
						had given sufficient satisfaction in this point, and that no
						other cause was to be sought after or allowed but that
						which he mentions, the fruit. For the fruit, being new
						and flatulent, raises many disturbing vapors in the body;
						for it is not likely that only wine ferments, or new oil only
						makes a noise in the lamp, the heat agitating its vapor;
						but new corn and all sorts of fruit are plump and distended,
						till the unconcocted flatulent vapor is broke away. And
						that some sorts of food disturb dreams, they said, was
						evident from beans and the polypus's head, from which
						those who would divine by their dreams are commanded
						to abstain.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="2">
                  <p>But Favorinus himself, though in all other things he
						admires Aristotle exceedingly and thinks the Peripatetic
						philosophy to be most probable, yet in this case resolved
						to scour up an old musty opinion of Democritus. He first
						laid down that known principle of his, that images pass
						through the pores into the inmost parts of the body, and
						being carried upward cause dreams; and that these images
						fly from every thing, vessels, garments, plants, but especially from animals, because of their heat and the motion
						of their spirits; and that these images not only carry the
						outward shape and likeness of the bodies (as Epicurus
						thinks, following Democritus so far and no farther), but
						the very designs, motions, and passions of the soul; and
						with those entering into the bodies, as if they were living
						things, discover to those that receive them the thoughts
						and inclinations of the persons from whom they come, if
						so be that they preserve their frame and order entire. And
						that is especially preserved when the air is calm and clear,
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.434"/>
						
						their passage then being quick and undisturbed. Now the
						autumnal air, when trees shed their leaves, being very uneven and disturbed, ruffles and disorders the images, and,
						hindering them in their passage, makes them weak and
						ineffectual; when, on the contrary, if they rise from warm
						and vigorous subjects, and are presently applied, the
						notices which they give and the impressions they make
						are clear and evident.</p>
               </div3>
               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>Then with a smile looking upon Autobulus, he continued: But, sir, I perceive you design to have an airy
						skirmish with these images, and try the goodness of this
						old opinion, as you would a picture, by your touch. And
						Autobulus replied: Pray, sir, do not endeavor to cheat us
						any longer; for we know very well that you, designing to
						make Aristotle's opinion appear the better, have used this
						of Democritus only as its shade. Therefore I shall pass
						by that, and impugn Aristotle's opinion, which unjustly
						lays the blame on the new fruit. For both the summer
						and the early autumn bear testimony in its favor, when, as
						Antimachus says, the fruit is most fresh and juicy; for
						then, though we eat the new fruit, yet our dreams are less
						vain than at other times. And the months when the
						leaves fall, being next to winter, so concoct the corn and
						remaining fruit, that they grow shrivelled and less, and
						lose all their brisk agitating spirit. As for new wine, those
						that drink it soonest forbear till February, which is after
						winter; and the day on which we begin we call the day of
						the Good Genius, and the Athenians the day of cask-opening. For whilst wine is working, we see that even common
						laborers will not venture on it. Therefore no more accusing the gifts of the Gods, let us seek after another cause
						of vain dreams, to which the name of the season will
						direct us. For it is called <hi rend="italics">leaf-shedding,</hi> because the
						leaves then fall on account of their dryness and coldness;
						except the leaves of hot and oily trees, as of the olive the
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.435"/>
						
						laurel, or the palm; or of the moist, as of the myrtle and
						the ivy. But the temperature of these preserves them,
						though not others; because in others the vicious humor
						that holds the leaves is constipated by the cold, or being
						weak and little is dried up. Now moisture and heat are
						necessary for the growth and preservation of plants, but
						especially of animals; and on the contrary, coldness and
						dryness are very noxious to both. And therefore Homer
						elegantly calls men moist and juicy; to rejoice he calls
						to be warmed; and any thing that is grievous and frightful he calls cold and icy. Besides, the words <foreign lang="greek">a)li/bas</foreign> and
						<foreign lang="greek">skeleto/s</foreign> are applied to the dead, those names intimating
						their extreme dryness. But more, our blood, the principal
						thing in our whole body, is moist and hot. And old age
						hath neither of those two qualities. Now the autumn
						seems to be as it were the old age of the decaying year;
						for the moisture doth not yet fall, and the heat decays.
						And its inclining the body to diseases is an evident sign of
						its cold and dryness. Now it is necessary that the souls
						should be indisposed with the bodies and that, the subtile
						spirit being condensed, the divining faculty of the soul,
						like a mirror that is breathed upon, should be sullied;
						and therefore it cannot represent any thing plain, distinct, and clear, as long as it remains thick, dark, and
						condensed.</p>

						which is usually placed before the other two but never
						after either; and that is Alpha. For that put either after
						Iota or Upsilon will not be pronounced, will not make one
						syllable with them, but as it were resenting the affront
						and angry at the position, seeks the first as its proper
						place. But if you place Alpha before either of those,
						they are obedient, and quietly join in one syllable, as in
						these words, <foreign lang="greek">au)/rion, au)lei=n, *ai)/antos, ai)dei=sqai</foreign>, and a thousand
						others. In these three respects therefore, as the conquerors in all the five exercises, it claims the precedence,&mdash;that
						of most other letters by being a vowel, that of other vowels by being double-timed, and lastly, that of these double-timed vowels themselves because it is its natural place to
						be set before and never after them.</p>

                  <p>Protogenes making a pause, Ammonius, speaking to
						me, said: What! have you, being a Boeotian, nothing to say
						for Cadmus, who (as the story goes) placed Alpha the first
						in order, because a cow is called Alpha by the Phoenicians,

						all, I replied, for it is just that, to the best of my power,
						I should rather assist my own than Bacchus's grandfather.
						For Lamprias my grandfather said, that the first articulate
						sound that is made is Alpha; for the air in the mouth is
						formed and fashioned by the motion of the lips; now as
						soon as those are opened, that sound breaks forth, being
						very plain and simple, not requiring or depending upon
						the motion of the tongue, but gently breathed forth whilst
						that lies still. Therefore that is the first sound that children

						if there be any, of the number of the letters; for, in my
						opinion, there is; and I think so, because the number of
						mutes and semi-vowels, compared between themselves or
						with the vowels, doth not seem casual and undesigned, but
						to be according to the first proportion which you call arithmetical. For their number being nine, eight, and seven,
						the middle exceeds the last as much as it wants of the first.
						And the first number being compared with the last, hath
						the same proportion that the Muses have to Apollo; for
						nine is appropriated to them, and seven to him. And

						my opinion, to place an animal that makes no noise at the
						head of the letters. Amongst all the numbers, the fourth
						is peculiarly dedicated to Mercury, because, as some say,
						the God was born on the fourth day of the month. The
						first letters called Phoenician from Cadmus are four times
						four, or sixteen; and of those that were afterward added,
						Palamedes found four, and Simonides four more. Now
						amongst numbers, three is the first perfect, as consisting of

                  <p>This startled Lamprias a little, but, after a short
						pause, he continued thus: Plato often tells merry stories
						under borrowed names, but when he puts any fable into a
						discourse concerning the soul, he hath some considerable
						meaning in it. The intelligent nature of the heavens he
						calls a flying chariot, intimating the harmonious whirl of
						the world. And here he introduceth one Er, the son of
						Harmonius, a Pamphylian, to tell what he had seen in
						hell; intimating that our souls are begotten according to
						harmony, and are agreeably united to our bodies, and that,
						when they are separated, they are from all parts carried
						together into the air, and from thence return to second
						generations. And what hinders but that twentieth (<foreign lang="greek">ei)kosto/n</foreign>)
						should intimate that this was not a true story, but only
						probable and fictitious (<foreign lang="greek">ei)ko/s</foreign>), and that the lot fell casually
						(<foreign lang="greek">ei)kh=</foreign>). For Plato always toucheth upon three causes,
						he being the first and chiefest philosopher that knew how
						fate agrees with fortune, and how our free-will is mixed
						and complicated with both. And now he hath admirably
						discovered what influence each hath upon our affairs. The
						choice of our life he hath left to our free-will, for virtue
						and vice are free. But that those who have made a good
						choice should live religiously, and those who have made
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.444"/>
						
						an ill choice should lead a contrary life, he leaves to the
						necessity of fate. But the chances of lots thrown at a
						venture introduce fortune into the several conditions of life
						in which we are brought up, which pre-occupates and perverts our own choice. Now consider whether it is not
						irrational to enquire after a cause of those things that are
						done by chance. For if the lot seems to be disposed of
						by design, it ceaseth to be chance and fortune, and becomes
						fate and providence.</p>

                  <p>THIS discourse ended, we poured out our offerings to

						upon the harp, the generation of the Muses out of Hesiod.
						After the song was done, Herod the rhetorician said:
						Pray, sirs, hearken. Those that will not admit Calliope
						to be ours say that she keeps company with kings, not
						such, I suppose, as are busied in resolving syllogisms or
						disputing, but such who do those things that belong to

						Clio abets encomiums, for praises are called <foreign lang="greek">kle/a</foreign>; and
						Polymnia history, for her name signifies the remembrance
						of many things; and it is said that all the Muses were
						somewhere called Remembrances. And for my part, I think
						Euterpe hath some relation to us too, if (as Chrysippus
						says) her lot be agreeableness in discourse and pleasantness in conversation. For it belongs to an orator to converse, as well as plead or give advice; since it is his part
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.451"/>
						
						to gain the favor of his auditors, and to defend or excuse

						and if we manage this artfully, it will turn to considerable
						account; if unskilfully, we are lost. For that saying,

                  <p>And therefore Jove made but one Minerva, one Diana, one

							certainly have considered this matter. What difficulty is
							there in that? replied Herod. The number nine is in every
							body's mouth, as being the first square of the first odd number; and as doubly odd, since it may be divided into three
							equal odd numbers. Ammonius with a smile subjoined:
							Boldly said; and pray add, that this number is composed of the first two cubes, one and eight, and according
							to another composition of two triangles, three and six, each
							of which is itself perfect. But why should this belong to
							Muses more than any other of the Gods? For we
							have nine Muses, but not nine Cereses, nine Minervas or
							Dianas. For I do not believe you take it for a good argument, that the Muses must be so many, because their

               <div3 type="section" n="3">
                  <p>My brother said, that the ancients celebrated but
						three Muses, and that to bring proofs for this assertion
						would be pedantic and uncivil in such a company. The
						reason of this number was (not as some say) the three
						different sorts of music, the diatonic, the chromatic, and
						harmonic, nor those stops that make the intervals nete,
						mese, and hypate; though the Delphians gave the Muses
						this name erroneously, in my opinion, appropriating it to
						one science, or rather to a part of one single science, the
						harmoniac part of music. But, as I think, the ancients,
						reducing all arts and sciences which are practised and performed by reason or discourse to three heads, philosophy,
						rhetoric, and mathematics, accounted them the gifts of
						three Gods, and named them the Muses. Afterwards, about
						Hesiod's time, the sciences being better and more thoroughly looked into, men subdividing them found that each
						science contained three different parts. In mathematics
						are comprehended music, arithmetic, and geometry; in
						philosophy are logic, ethics, and physics. In rhetoric, they
						say the first part was demonstrative or encomiastic, the
						second deliberative, the third judicial. None of all which
						they believed to be without a God or a Muse or some
						superior power for its patron, and did not, it is probable,
						make the Muses equal in number to these divisions, but
						found them to be so. Now, as you may divide nine into
						threes, and each three into as many units; so there is but
						one rectitude of reason, which is employed about the supreme truth, and which belongs to the whole in common,
						while each of the three kinds of science has three Muses
						assigned to it, and each of these has her separate faculty
						assigned to her, which she disposes and orders. And I do
						not think the poets and astrologers will find fault with us
						for passing over their professions in silence, since they
						
						<pb id="v.3.p.453"/>
						
						know, as well as we, that astrology is comprehended in
						geometry, and poetry in music.</p>

               <div3 type="section" n="4">
                  <p>As soon as he had said this, Trypho the physician
						subjoined: How hath our art offended you, that you have
						shut the Museum against us? And Dionysius of Melite
						added: Sir, you have a great many that will side with you
						in the accusation; for we farmers think Thalia to be ours,
						assigning her the care of springing and budding seeds and
						plants. But I interposing said: Your accusation is not
						just; for you have bountiful Ceres, and Bacchus who
						(as Pindar phraseth it) increaseth the trees, the chaste
						beauty of the fruits; and we know that Aesculapius is
						the patron of the physicians, and they make their address
						to Apollo as Paean, but never as the Muses' chief. All
						men (as Homer says) stand in need of the Gods, but all
						stand not in need of all. But I wonder Lamprias did not
						mind what the Delphians say in this matter; for they
						affirm that the Muses amongst them were not named so
						either from the strings or sounds in music; but the universe being divided into three parts, the first portion was
						of the fixed stars, the second of the planets, the third of
						those things that are under the concave of the moon; and
						all these are ordered according to harmonical proportions,
						and of each portion a Muse takes care; Hypate of the first,
						Nete of the last, and Mese in the middle, combining as
						much as possible, and turning about mortal things with the
						Gods, and earthly with heavenly. And Plato intimates the
						same thing under the names of the Fates, calling one Atropos, the other Lachesis, and the other Clotho. For he
						committed the revolutions of the eight spheres to so many

						<pb id="v.3.p.454"/>
						
						that neither love nor are benevolent to mankind, wholly
						passing by the Muses, or calling them by the names of the

                  <p>No doubt, said Ammonius, as it is in us a violent and
						involuntary cause; but in the Gods Necessity is not intolerable, uncontrollable, or violent, unless it be to the wicked:
						as the law in a commonwealth to the best men is its best
						good, not to be violated or transgressed, not because they
						have no power, but because they have no will, to change
						it. And Homer's Sirens give us no just reason to be
						afraid; for he in that fable rightly intimates the power of
						their music not to be hurtful to man, but delightfully
						charming, and detaining the souls which pass from hence
						thither and wander after death; working in them a love
						for divine and heavenly things, and a forgetfulness of every
						thing on earth; and they extremely pleased follow and
						attend them. And from thence some imperfect sound, and
						as it were echo of that music, coming to us by the means
						of reason and good precepts, rouseth our souls, and restores the notice of those things to our minds, the greatest
						part of which lie encumbered with and entangled in disturbances of the flesh and distracting passions. But the
						generous soul hears and remembers, and her affection for
						those pleasures riseth up to the most ardent passion, whilst
						she eagerly desires but is not able to free herself from

                  <p>It is true, I do not approve what he says; but Plato

						<quote rend="blockquote">This fine discourse seems near allied to truth,</quote>
                  </p>
                  <p>and desired every one to deliver his opinion. And I, after
							a short silence, said: As Plato thinks by the name, as it
							were by tracks, to discover the powers of the Gods, so let
							us place in heaven and over heavenly things one of the
							Muses, Urania. And it is likely that those require no distracting variety of cares to govern them, since they have
							the same single nature for the cause of all their motions.
							But where are a great many irregularities and disorders,
							there we must place the eight Muses, that we may have
							one to correct each particular irregularity and miscarriage.
							There are two parts in a man's life, the serious and the
							merry; and each must be regulated and methodized. The
							serious part, which instructs us in the knowledge and
							
							<pb id="v.3.p.456"/>
							
							contemplation of the Gods, Calliope, Clio, and Thalia seem
							chiefly to look after and direct. The other Muses govern
							our weak part, which changes presently into wantonness
							and folly; they do not neglect our brutish and violent passions and let them run their own course, but by apposite
							dancing, music, song, and orderly motion mixed with
							reason, bring them down to a moderate temper and condition. For my part, since Plato admits two principles of
							every action, the natural desire after pleasure, and acquired
							opinion which covets and wishes for the best, and calls one
							reason and the other passion, and since each of these
							is manifold, I think that each requires a considerable and, to speak the truth, a divine direction. For instance, one faculty of our reason is said to be political
							or imperial, over which Hesiod says Calliope presides;
							Clio's province is the noble and aspiring; and Polymnia's
							that faculty of the soul which inclines to attain and keep
							knowledge (and therefore the Sicyonians call one of their
							three Muses Polymathia); to Euterpe everybody allows
							the searches into nature and physical speculations, there
							being no greater, no sincerer pleasure belonging to any
							other sort of speculation in the world. The natural desire
							to meat and drink Thalia reduceth from brutish and uncivil
							to be sociable and friendly; and therefore we say <foreign lang="greek">qalia/zein</foreign>
							of those that are friendly, merry, and sociable over their
							cups, and not of those that are quarrelsome and mad.
							Erato, together with Persuasion, that brings along with it
							reason and opportunity, presides over marriages; she
							takes away and extinguisheth all the violent fury of pleasure, and makes it tend to friendship, mutual confidence,
							and endearment, and not to effeminacy, lust, or discontent. The delight which the eye or ear receives is a
							sort of pleasure, either appropriate to reason or to passion, or common to them both. This the two other Muses,
							Terpsichore and Melpomene, so moderate, that the one

						be best skilled and took most care to observe their steps,
						to dance in the style called <foreign lang="greek">fora\n para\ fora/n</foreign>. Upon this
						Thrasybulus, the son of Ammonius, demanded what <foreign lang="greek">fora/</foreign>
						signified, and gave Ammonius occasion to run over most of
						the parts of dancing.</p>

                  <p>He said they were three,&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">fora/, sxh=ma</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">dei=cis</foreign>. For
						dancing is made up of motion and manner (<foreign lang="greek">sxe/sis</foreign>), as a
						song of sounds and stops; stops are the ends of motion.
						Now the motions they call <foreign lang="greek">forai/</foreign>, and the gestures and likeness to which the motions tend, and in which they end,
						they call <foreign lang="greek">sxh/mata</foreign>: as, for instance, when by their own
						motions they represent the figure of Apollo, Pan, or any
						of the raging Bacchae. The third, <foreign lang="greek">dei=cis</foreign>, is not an imitation,
						but a plain downright indication of the things represented. For the poets, when they would speak of Achilles,
						Ulysses, the earth, or heaven, use their proper names, and
						such as the vulgar usually understand. But for the more
						lively representation, they use words which by their very
						sound express some eminent quality in the thing, or metaphors;

						 as when they say that streams do <q direct="unspecified">babble and flash;</q>
						that arrows fly <q direct="unspecified">desirous the flesh to wound;</q> or when they
						describe an equal battle by saying <q direct="unspecified">the fight had equal
							heads.</q> They have likewise a great many significative
						compositions in their verses. Thus Euripides of Perseus,
