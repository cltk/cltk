         <head>A discourse touching the training of children.</head>
         <div1 type="section" n="1">
            <p>The course which ought to be taken for the training
						of free-born children, and the means whereby their manners may be rendered virtuous, will, with the reader's leave,
						be the subject of our present disquisition.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>In the management of which, perhaps it may be expedient to take our rise from their very procreation. I
						would therefore, in the first place, advise those who desire
						to become the parents of famous and eminent children, that
						they keep not company with all women that they light on;
						I mean such as harlots, or concubines. For such children
						as are blemished in their birth, either by the father's or
						the mother's side, are liable to be pursued, as long as they
						live, with the indelible infamy of their base extraction, as
						that which offers a ready occasion to all that desire to take
						hold of it of reproaching and disgracing them therewith.
						So that it was a wise speech of the poet who said,&mdash;

					       </p>
            <p>Wherefore, since to be well born gives men a good stock
						of confidence, the consideration hereof ought to be of no
						small value to such as desire to leave behind them a lawful issue. For the spirits of men who are alloyed and
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.4"/>
						
						counterfeit in their birth are naturally enfeebled and debased; as rightly said the poet again,&mdash;
						
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>A bold and daring spirit is often daunted,</l>

            </p>
            <p>So, on the contrary, a certain loftiness and natural gallantry of spirit is wont to fill the breasts of those who are
						born of illustrious parents. Of which Diophantus, the
						young son of Themistocles, is a notable instance; for he is
						reported to have made his boast often and in many companies, that whatsoever pleased him pleased also all Athens:
						for whatever he liked, his mother liked; and whatever his
						mother liked, Themistocles liked; and whatever Themistocles liked, all the Athenians liked. Wherefore it was
						gallantly done of the Lacedaemonian States, when they
						laid a round fine on their king Archidamus for marrying
						a little woman, giving this reason for their so doing: that
						he meant to beget for them not kings, but kinglings.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>The advice which I am, in the next place, about to
						give, is, indeed, no other than what hath been given by those
						who have undertaken this argument before me. You will
						ask me what is that? It is this: that no man keep company with his wife for issue's sake but when he is sober,
						having drunk either no wine, or at least not such a quantity as to distemper him; for they usually prove winebibbers and drunkards, whose parents begot them when
						they were drunk. Wherefore Diogenes said to a stripling
						somewhat crack-brained and half-witted: Surely, young
						man, thy father begot thee when he was drunk. Let this
						suffice to be spoken concerning the procreation of children;
						and let us pass thence to their education.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>And here, to speak summarily, what we are wont to
						say of arts and sciences may be said also concerning virtue:
						that there is a concurrence of three things requisite to the
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.5"/>
						
						completing thereof in practice,&mdash;which are nature, reason,
						and use. Now by reason here I would be understood to
						mean learning; and by use, exercise. Now the principles
						come from instruction, the practice comes from exercise,
						and perfection from all three combined. And accordingly
						as either of the three is deficient, virtue must needs be
						defective. For if nature be not improved by instruction, it
						is blind; if instruction be not assisted by nature, it is
						maimed; and if exercise fail of the assistance of both, it is
						imperfect as to the attainment of its end. And as in husbandry it is first requisite that the soil be fertile, next that
						the husbandman be skilful, and lastly that the seed he
						sows be good; so here nature resembles the soil, the instructor of youth the husbandman, and the rational principles and precepts which are taught, the seed. And I
						would peremptorily affirm that all these met and jointly
						conspired to the completing of the souls of those universally celebrated men, Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato,
						together with all others whose eminent worth hath gotten
						them immortal glory. And happy is that man certainly,
						and well-beloved of the Gods, on whom by the bounty of
						any of them all these are conferred.</p>
            <p>And yet if any one thinks that those in whom Nature
						hath not thoroughly done her part may not in some measure
						make up her defects, if they be so happy as to light upon
						good teaching, and withal apply their own industry towards
						the attainment of virtue, he is to know that he is very
						much, nay, altogether, mistaken. For as a good natural
						capacity may be impaired by slothfulness, so dull and
						heavy natural parts may be improved by instruction; and
						whereas negligent students arrive not at the capacity of
						understanding the most easy things, those who are industrious conquer the greatest difficulties. And many instances
						we may observe, that give us a clear demonstration of
						the mighty force and successful efficacy of labor and industry.
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.6"/>
						
						 For water continually dropping will wear hard rocks
						hollow; yea, iron and brass are worn out with constant
						handling. Nor can we, if we would, reduce the felloes of
						a cart-wheel to their former straightness, when once they
						have been bent by force; yea, it is above the power of
						force to straighten the bended staves sometimes used by
						actors upon the stage. So far is that which labor effects,
						though against nature, more potent than what is produced
						according to it. Yea, have we not many millions of instances more which evidence the force of industry? Let
						us see in some few that follow. A man's ground is of itself
						good; yet, if it be unmanured, it will contract barrenness;
						and the better it was naturally, so much the more is it
						ruined by carelessness, if it be ill-husbanded. On the
						other side, let a man's ground be more than ordinarily
						rough and rugged; yet experience tells us that, if it be
						well manured, it will be quickly made capable of bearing
						excellent fruit. Yea, what sort of tree is there which will
						not, if neglected, grow crooked and unfruitful; and what
						but will, if rightly ordered, prove fruitful and bring its
						fruit to maturity? What strength of body is there which
						will not lose its vigor and fall to decay by laziness, nice
						usage, and debauchery? And, on the contrary, where is
						the man of never so crazy a natural constitution, who cannot render himself far more robust, if he will only give
						himself to exercises of activity and strength? What horse
						well managed from a colt proves not easily governable by
						the rider? And where is there one to be found which, if
						not broken betimes, proves not stiff-necked and unmanageable? Yea, why need we wonder at any thing else when
						we see the wildest beasts made tame and brought to hand
						by industry? And lastly, as to men themselves, that
						Thessalian answered not amiss, who, being asked which
						of his countrymen were the meekest, replied: Those that
						have received their discharge from the wars.</p>
            <pb id="v.1.p.7"/>
            <p>But what need of multiplying more words in this matter,
						when even the notion of the word <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in the Greek language imports continuance, and he that should call moral
						virtues customary virtues would seem to speak not incongruously? I shall conclude this part of my discourse,
						therefore, with the addition of one only instance. Lycurgus,
						the Lacedaemonian lawgiver, once took two whelps of the
						same litter, and ordered them to be bred in a quite different
						manner; whereby the one became dainty and ravenous,
						and the other of a good scent and skilled in hunting; which
						done, a while after he took occasion thence in an assembly
						of the Lacedaemonians to discourse in this manner: Of
						great weight in the attainment of virtue, fellow-citizens,
						are habits, instruction, precepts, and indeed the whole manner of life,&mdash;as I will presently let you see by example.
						And, withal, he ordered the producing those two whelps
						into the midst of the hall, where also there were set down
						before them a plate and a live hare. Whereupon, as they
						had been bred, the one presently flies upon the hare, and the
						other as greedily runs to the plate. And while the people
						were musing, not perfectly apprehending what he meant
						by producing those whelps thus, he added: These whelps
						were both of one litter, but differently bred; the one, you
						see, has turned out a greedy cur, and the other a good
						hound. And this shall suffice to be spoken concerning
						custom and different ways of living.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>The next thing that falls under our consideration is
						the nursing of children, which, in my judgment, the
						mothers should do themselves, giving their own breasts to
						those they have borne. For this office will certainly be
						performed with more tenderness and carefulness by natural mothers, who will love their children intimately, as
						the saying is, from their tender nails.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <foreign lang="greek">)*ec o)nu/xwn a(palw=n.</foreign>
               </note> Whereas, both
						wet and dry nurses, who are hired, love only for their pay,
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.8"/>
						
						and are affected to their work as ordinarily those that are
						substituted and deputed in the place of others are. Yea,
						even Nature seems to have assigned the suckling and nursing of the issue to those that bear them; for which cause she
						hath bestowed upon every living creature that brings forth
						young, milk to nourish them withal. And, in conformity
						thereto, Providence hath also wisely ordered that women
						should have two breasts, that so, if any of them should happen
						to bear twins, they might have two several springs of nourishment ready for them. Though, if they had not that
						furniture, mothers would still be more kind and loving to
						their own children. And that not without reason; for constant feeding together is a great means to heighten the
						affection mutually betwixt any persons. Yea, even beasts,
						when they are separated from those that have grazed with
						them, do in their way show a longing for the absent.
						Wherefore, as I have said, mothers themselves should strive
						to the utmost to nurse their own children. But if they
						find it impossible to do it themselves, either because of
						bodily weakness (and such a case may fall out), or because
						they are apt to be quickly with child again, then are they
						to chose the honestest nurses they can get, and not to
						take whomsoever they have offered them. And the first
						thing to be looked after in this choice is, that the nurses be
						bred after the Greek fashion. For as it is needful that the
						members of children be shaped aright as soon as they are
						born, that they may not afterwards prove crooked and distorted, so it is no less expedient that their manners be well
						fashioned from the very beginning. For childhood is a
						tender thing, and easily wrought into any shape. Yea,
						and the very souls of children readily receive the impressions of those things that are dropped into them while they
						are yet but soft; but when they grow older, they will, as all
						hard things are, be more difficult to be wrought upon. And
						as soft wax is apt to take the stamp of the seal, so are the
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.9"/>
						
						minds of children to receive the instructions imprinted on
						them at that age. Whence, also, it seems to me good advice
						which divine Plato gives to nurses, not to tell all sorts of
						common tales to children in infancy, lest thereby their
						minds should chance to be filled with foolish and corrupt
						notions.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See Plato, Repub. II. p. 377 C.</note> The like good counsel Phocylides, the poet, seems
						to give in this verse of his:&mdash;
						
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>If we'll have virtuous children, we should choose</l>
							           <l>Their tenderest age good principles to infuse.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>Nor are we to omit taking due care, in the first place,
						that those children who are appointed to attend upon such
						young nurslings, and to be bred with them for play-fellows,
						be well-mannered, and next that they speak plain, natural
						Greek; lest, being constantly used to converse with persons
						of a barbarous language and evil manners, they receive
						corrupt tinctures from them. For it is a true proverb, that
						if you live with a lame man, you will learn to halt.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="7">
            <p>Next, when a child is arrived at such an age as to be
						put under the care of pedagogues, great care is to be used
						that we be not deceived in them, and so commit our children to slaves or barbarians or cheating fellows. For it is
						a course never enough to be laughed at which many men
						nowadays take in this affair; for if any of their servants
						be better than the rest, they dispose some of them to follow
						husbandry, some to navigation, some to merchandise, some
						to be stewards in their houses, and some, lastly, to put
						out their money to use for them. But if they find any
						slave that is a drunkard or a glutton, and unfit for any other
						business, to him they assign the government of their children; whereas, a good pedagogue ought to be such a one in
						his disposition as Phoenix, tutor to Achilles, was.</p>
            <p>And now I come to speak of that which is greater
						matter, and of more concern than any that I have said.
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.10"/>
						
						We are to look after such masters for our children as are
						blameless in their lives, not justly reprovable for their manners, and of the best experience in teaching. For the very
						spring and root of honesty and virtue lies in the felicity of
						lighting on good education. And as husbandmen are wont
						to set forks to prop up feeble plants, so do honest schoolmasters prop up youth by careful instructions and admonitions, that they may duly bring forth the buds of good
						manners. But there are certain fathers nowadays who
						deserve that men should spit on them in contempt, who,
						before making any proof of those to whom they design to
						commit the teaching of their children, either through unacquaintance, or, as it sometimes falls out, through unskilfulness, intrust them to men of no good reputation, or, it
						may be, such as are branded with infamy. Although they
						are not altogether so ridiculous, if they offend herein
						through unskilfulness; but it is a thing most extremely
						absurd, when, as oftentimes it happens, though they know
						and are told beforehand, by those who understand better
						than themselves, both of the inability and rascality of certain schoolmasters, they nevertheless commit the charge
						of their children to them, sometimes overcome by their
						fair and flattering speeches, and sometimes prevailed on
						to gratify friends who entreat them. This is an error of
						like nature with that of the sick man, who, to please his
						friends, forbears to send for the physician that might save
						his life by his skill, and employs a mountebank that quickly dispatcheth him out of the world; or of him who
						refuses a skilful shipmaster, and then, at his friend's entreaty, commits the care of his vessel to one that is therein
						much his inferior. In the name of Jupiter and all the Gods,
						tell me how can that man deserve the name of a father,
						who is more concerned to gratify others in their requests,
						than to have his children well educated? Or, is not
						that rather fitly applicable to this case, which Socrates,
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.11"/>
						
						that ancient philosopher, was wont to say,&mdash;that, if he
						could get up to the highest place in the city, he would lift
						up his voice and make this proclamation thence: <q direct="unspecified">What
							mean you, fellow-citizens, that you thus turn every stone to
							scrape wealth together, and take so little care of your
							children, to whom, one day, you must relinquish it all?</q>&mdash;
						to which I would add this, that such parents do like him
						that is solicitous about his shoe, but neglects the foot that
						is to wear it. And yet many fathers there are, who so
						love their money and hate their children, that, lest it should
						cost them more than they are willing to spare to hire a
						good schoolmaster for them, they rather choose such persons to instruct their children as are of no worth; thereby
						beating down the market, that they may purchase ignorance
						cheap. It was, therefore, a witty and handsome jeer
						which Aristippus bestowed on a sottish father, who asked
						him what he would take to teach his child. He answered,
						A thousand drachms. Whereupon the other cried out:
						O Hercules, what a price you ask! for I can buy a slave
						at that rate. Do so, then, said the philosopher, and
						thou shalt have two slaves instead of one,&mdash;thy son for
						one, and him thou buyest for another. Lastly, how
						absurd it is, when thou accustomest thy children to take
						their food with their right hands, and chidest them if they
						receive it with their left, yet thou takest no care at all that
						the principles that are infused into them be right and
						regular.</p>
            <p>And now I will tell you what ordinarily is like to befall
						such prodigious parents, when they have had their sons ill
						nursed and worse taught. For when such sons are arrived
						at man's estate, and, through contempt of a sound and
						orderly way of living, precipitate themselves into all manner of disorderly and servile pleasures, then will those
						parents dearly repent of their own neglect of their children's education, when it is too late to amend it; and vex
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.12"/>
						
						themselves, even to distraction, at their vicious courses.
						For then do some of those children acquaint themselves
						with flatterers and parasites, a sort of infamous and execrable persons, the very pests that corrupt and ruin young
						men; others maintain mistresses and harlots, insolent and
						extravagant; others waste their substance; others, again,
						come to shipwreck on gaming and revelling. And some
						venture on still more audacious crimes, committing adultery and joining in the orgies of Bacchus, being ready
						to purchase one bout of debauched pleasure at the price
						of their lives. If now they had but conversed with some
						philosopher, they would never have enslaved themselves
						to such courses as these; though possibly they might have
						learned at least to put in practice the precept of Diogenes,
						delivered by him indeed in rude language, but yet containing, as to the scope of it, a great truth, when he advised
						a young man to go to the public stews, that he might then
						inform himself, by experience, how things of greatest value
						and things of no value at all were there of equal worth.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="8">
            <p>In brief therefore I say (and what I say may justly
						challenge the repute of an oracle rather than of advice),
						that the one chief thing in this matter&mdash;which corn
						priseth the beginning, middle, and end of all&mdash;is good
						education and regular instruction; and that these two afford
						great help and assistance towards the attainment of virtue
						and felicity. For all other good things are but human and
						of small value, such as will hardly recompense the industry
						required to the getting of them. It is, indeed, a desirable
						thing to be well descended; but the glory belongs to our
						ancestors. Riches are valuable; but they are the goods of
						Fortune, who frequently takes them from those that have
						them, and carries them to those that never so much as
						hoped for them. Yea, the greater they are, the fairer
						mark are they for those to aim at who design to make our
						bags their prize; I mean evil servants and accusers. But
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.13"/>
						
						the weightiest consideration of all is, that riches may be
						enjoyed by the worst as well as the best of men. Glory is
						a thing deserving respect, but unstable; beauty is a prize
						that men fight to obtain, but, when obtained, it is of little
						continuance; health is a precious enjoyment, but easily impaired; strength is a thing desirable, but apt to be the
						prey of diseases and old age. And, in general, let any man
						who values himself upon strength of body know that he
						makes a great mistake; for what indeed is any proportion
						of human strength, if compared to that of other animals,
						such as elephants and bulls and lions? But learning alone,
						of all things in our possession, is immortal and divine. And
						two things there are that are most peculiar to human
						nature, reason and speech; of which two, reason is the
						master of speech, and speech is the servant of reason, impregnable against all assaults of fortune, not to be taken
						away by false accusation, nor impaired by sickness, nor
						enfeebled by old age. For reason alone grows youthful
						by age; and time, which decays all other things, increaseth
						knowledge in us in our decaying years. Yea, war itself,
						which like a winter torrent bears down all other things
						before it and carries them away with it, leaves learning
						alone behind. Whence the answer seems to me very remarkable, which Stilpo, a philosopher of Megara, gave to
						Demetrius, who, when he levelled that city to the ground
						and made all the citizens bondmen, asked Stilpo whether
						he had lost any thing. Nothing, said he, for war cannot
						plunder virtue. To this saying that of Socrates also is very
						agreeable; who, when Gorgias (as I take it) asked him
						what his opinion was of the king of Persia, and whether
						he judged him happy, returned answer, that he could not
						tell what to think of him, because he knew not how he was
						furnished with virtue and learning,&mdash;as judging human
						felicity to consist in those endowments, and not in those
						which are subject to fortune.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as it is my advice to parents that they make
						the breeding up of their children to learning the chiefest
						of their care, so I here add, that the learning they ought
						to train them up unto should be sound and wholesome, and
						such as is most remote from those trifles which suit the
						popular humor. For to please the many is to displease
						the wise. To this saying of mine that of Euripides himself bears witness:&mdash;

            <p>Besides, I find by my own observation, that those persons
						who make it their business to speak so as to deserve the
						favor and approbation of the scum of the people, ordinarily
						live at a suitable rate, voluptuously and intemperately.
						And there is reason for it. For they who have no regard
						to what is honest, so they may make provision for other
						men's pleasures, will surely not be very propense to prefer
						what is right and wholesome before that which gratifies
						their own inordinate pleasures and luxurious inclinations,
						and to quit that which humors them for that which restrains
						them.</p>
            <p>If any one ask what the next thing is wherein I would
						have children instructed, and to what further good qualities
						I would have them inured, I answer, that I think it advisable that they neither speak nor do any thing rashly; for,
						according to the proverb, the best things are the most
						difficult. But extemporary discourses are full of much
						ordinary and loose stuff, nor do such speakers well know
						where to begin or where to make an end. And besides
						other faults which those who speak suddenly are commonly guilty of, they are commonly liable to this great
						one, that they multiply words without measure; whereas,
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.15"/>
						
						premeditation will not suffer a man to enlarge his discourse beyond a due proportion. To this purpose it is
						reported of Pericles, that, being often called upon by
						the people to speak, he would not, because (as he said)
						he was unprepared. And Demosthenes also, who imitated him in the managery of public affairs, when the
						Athenians urged him to give his counsel, refused it with
						this answer: I have not yet prepared myself. Though it
						may be that this story is a mere fiction, brought down to
						us by uncertain tradition, without any credible author.
						But Demosthenes, in his oration against Midias, clearly sets
						forth the usefulness of premeditation. For there he says:
						<q direct="unspecified">I confess, O ye Athenians! that I came hither provided to
							speak; and I will by no means deny that I have spent my
							utmost study upon the composing this oration. For it had
							been a pitiful omission in me, if, having suffered and still
							suffering such things, I should have neglected that which
							in this cause was to be spoken by me.</q>
               <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Demosth. in Mid. p. 576, 16.</note> But here I
						would not be understood altogether to condemn all readiness to discourse extempore, nor yet to allow the use of it
						upon such occasions as do not require it; but we are to
						use it only as we do physic. Still, before a person arrives
						at complete manhood, I would not permit him to speak
						upon any sudden incident occasion; though, after he has
						attained a radicated faculty of speaking, he may allow himself a greater liberty, as opportunity is offered. For as they
						who have been a long time in chains, when they are at last
						set at liberty, are unable to walk, on account of their former
						continual restraint, and are very apt to trip, so they who
						have been used to a fettered way of speaking a great while,
						if upon any occasion they be enforced to speak on a sudden,
						will hardly be able to express themselves without some
						tokens of their former confinement. But to permit those
						that are yet children to speak extemporally is to give them
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.16"/>
						
						occasion for extremely idle talk. A wretched painter, they
						say, showing Apelles a picture, told him withal that he had
						taken a very little time to paint it. If thou hadst not told
						me so, said Apelles, I see cause enough to believe it was a
						hasty draught; but I wonder that in that space of time
						thou hast not painted many more such pictures.</p>
            <p>I advise therefore (for I return now to the subject that I
						have digressed from) the shunning and avoiding, not merely
						of a starched, theatrical, and over-tragical form of speaking,
						but also of that which is too low and mean. For that
						which is too swelling is not fit for the managery of public
						affairs; and that, on the other side, which is too thin is very
						inapt to work any notable impression upon the hearers.
						For as it is not only requisite that a man's body be healthy,
						but also that it be of a firm constitution, so ought a discourse to be not only sound, but nervous also. For though
						such as is composed cautiously may be commended, yet
						that is all it can arrive at; whereas that which hath some
						adventurous passages in it is admired also. And my opinion
						is the same concerning the affections of the speaker's mind.
						For he must be neither of a too confident nor of a too
						mean and dejected spirit; for the one is apt to lead to
						impudence, the other to servility; and much of the orator's
						art, as well as great circumspection, is required to direct his
						course skilfully betwixt the two.</p>
            <p>And now (whilst I am handling this point concerning the
						instruction of children) I will also give you my judgment
						concerning the frame of a discourse; which is this, that to
						compose it in all parts uniformly not only is a great argument of a defect in learning, but also is apt, I think, to
						nauseate the auditory when it is practised; and in no case
						can it give lasting pleasure. For to sing the same tune, as
						the saying is, is in every thing cloying and offensive; but
						men are generally pleased with variety, as in speeches and
						pageants, so in all other entertainments.</p>
            <pb id="v.1.p.17"/>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="10">
            <p>Wherefore, though we ought not to permit an ingenuous child entirely to neglect any of the common sorts of
						learning, so far as they may be gotten by lectures or from
						public shows; yet I would have him to salute these only as
						in his passage, taking a bare taste of each of them (seeing
						no man can possibly attain to perfection in all), and to give
						philosophy the pre-eminence of them all. I can illustrate
						my meaning by an example. It is a fine thing to sail round
						and visit many cities, but it is profitable to fix our dwelling
						in the best. Witty also was the saying of Bias, the philosopher, that, as the wooers of Penelope, when they could not
						have their desire of the mistress, contented themselves to
						have to do with her maids, so commonly those students who
						are not capable of understanding philosophy waste themselves in the study of those sciences that are of no value.
						Whence it follows, that we ought to make philosophy the
						chief of all our learning. For though, in order to the welfare of the body, the industry of men hath found out two
						arts,&mdash;medicine, which assists to the recovery of lost health,
						and gymnastics, which help us to attain a sound constitution,&mdash;yet there is but one remedy for the distempers and
						diseases of the mind, and that is philosophy. For by the
						advice and assistance thereof it is that we come to understand what is honest, and what dishonest; what is just, and
						what unjust; in a word, what we are to seek, and what to
						avoid. We learn by it how we are to demean ourselves
						towards the Gods, towards our parents, our elders, the laws,
						strangers, governors, friends, wives, children, and servants.
						That is, we are to worship the Gods, to honor our parents,
						to reverence our elders, to be subject to the laws, to obey
						our governors, to love our friends, to use sobriety towards
						our wives, to be affectionate to our children, and not to treat
						our servants insolently; and (which is the chiefest lesson of
						all) not to be overjoyed in prosperity nor too much dejected
						in adversity; not to be dissolute in our pleasures, nor in our
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.18"/>
						
						anger to be transported with brutish rage and fury. These
						things I account the principal advantages which we gain by
						philosophy. For to use prosperity generously is the part of
						a man; to manage it so as to decline envy, of a well governed
						man; to master our pleasures by reason is the property of
						wise men; and to moderate anger is the attainment only of
						extraordinary men. But those of all men I count most complete, who know how to mix and temper the managery
						of civil affairs with philosophy; seeing they are thereby
						masters of two of the greatest good things that are,&mdash;a life
						of public usefulness as statesmen, and a life of calm tranquillity as students of philosophy. For, whereas there are
						three sorts of lives,&mdash;the life of action, the life of contemplation, and the life of pleasure,&mdash;the man who is utterly
						abandoned and a slave to pleasure is brutish and mean-spirited; he that spends his time in contemplation without
						action is an unprofitable man; and he that lives in action
						and is destitute of philosophy is a rustical man, and commits
						many absurdities. Wherefore we are to apply our utmost
						endeavor to enable ourselves for both; that is, to manage
						public employments, and withal, at convenient seasons, to
						give ourselves to philosophical studies. Such statesmen
						were Pericles and Archytas the Tarentine; such were Dion
						the Syracusan and Epaminondas the Theban, both of whom
						were of Plato's familiar acquaintance.</p>
            <p>I think it not necessary to spend many more words about
						this point, the instruction of children in learning. Only it
						may be profitable at least, or even necessary, not to omit
						procuring for them the writings of ancient authors, but to
						make such a collection of them as husbandmen are wont to
						do of all needful tools. For of the same nature is the use
						of books to scholars, as being the tools and instruments of
						learning, and withal enabling them to derive knowledge
						from its proper fountains.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="11">
            <p>In the next place, the exercise of the body must not
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.19"/>
						
						be neglected; but children must be sent to schools of gymnastics, where they may have sufficient employment that
						way also. This will conduce partly to a more handsome
						carriage, and partly to the improvement of their strength.
						For the foundation of a vigorous old age is a good constitution of the body in childhood. Wherefore, as it is expedient to provide those things in fair weather which may
						be useful to the mariners in a storm, so is it to keep good
						order and govern ourselves by rules of temperance in youth,
						as the best provision we can lay in for age. Yet must they
						husband their strength, so as not to become dried up (as it
						were) and destitute of strength to follow their studies.
						For, according to Plato, sleep and weariness are enemies to
						the arts.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, Repub. VII. p. 537, B.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But why do I stand so long on these things? I hasten to
						speak of that which is of the greatest importance, even
						beyond all that has been spoken of; namely, I would have
						boys trained for the contests of wars by practice in the
						throwing of darts, shooting of arrows, and hunting of wild
						beasts. For we must remember in war the goods of the
						conquered are proposed as rewards to the conquerors. But
						war does not agree with a delicate habit of body, used only
						to the shade; for even one lean soldier that hath been used
						to military exercises shall overthrow whole troops of mere
						wrestlers who know nothing of war. But, somebody may
						say, whilst you profess to give precepts for the education
						of all free-born children, why do you carry the matter so as
						to seem only to accommodate those precepts to the rich, and
						neglect to suit them also to the children of poor men and
						plebeians? To which objection it is no difficult thing to
						reply. For it is my desire that all children whatsoever may
						partake of the benefit of education alike; but if yet any
						persons, by reason of the narrowness of their estates, cannot
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.20"/>
						
						 make use of my precepts, let them not blame me that
						give them, but Fortune, which disableth them from making
						the advantage by them they otherwise might. Though
						even poor men must use their utmost endeavor to give their
						children the best education; or, if they cannot, they must
						bestow upon them the best that their abilities will reach.
						Thus much I thought fit here to insert in the body of my
						discourse, that I might the better be enabled to annex what
						I have yet to add concerning the right training of children.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="12">
            <p>I say now, that children are to be won to follow
						liberal studies by exhortations and rational motives, and
						on no account to be forced thereto by whipping or any
						other contumelious punishments. I will not urge that such
						usage seems to be more agreeable to slaves than to ingenuous children; and even slaves, when thus handled, are dulled
						and discouraged from the performance of their tasks, partly
						by reason of the smart of their stripes, and partly because
						of the disgrace thereby inflicted. But praise and reproof
						are more effectual upon free-born children than any such
						disgraceful handling; the former to incite them to what is
						good, and the latter to restrain them from that which is evil.
						But we must use reprehensions and commendations alternately, and of various kinds according to the occasion; so
						that when they grow petulant, they may be shamed by reprehension, and again, when they better deserve it, they may
						be encouraged by commendations. Wherein we ought to
						imitate nurses, who, when they have made their infants cry,
						stop their mouths with the nipple to quiet them again. It
						is also useful not to give them such large commendations as
						to puff them up with pride; for this is the ready way to fill
						them with a vain conceit of themselves, and to enfeeble
						their minds.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="13">
            <p>Moreover, I have seen some parents whose too much
						love to their children hath occasioned, in truth, their not
						loving them at all. I will give light to this assertion by an
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.21"/>
						
						example, to those who ask what it means. It is this: while
						they are over-hasty to advance their children in all sorts of
						learning beyond their equals, they set them too hard and
						laborious tasks, whereby they fall under discouragement;
						and this, with other inconveniences accompanying it, causeth them in the issue to be ill affected to learning itself.
						For as plants by moderate watering are nourished, but with
						over-much moisture are glutted, so is the spirit improved by
						moderate labors, but overwhelmed by such as are excessive.
						We ought therefore to give children some time to take
						breath from their constant labors, considering that all human
						life is divided betwixt business and relaxation. To which
						purpose it is that we are inclined by nature not only to wake,
						but to sleep also; that as we have sometimes wars, so likewise at other times peace; as some foul, so other fair days;
						and, as we have seasons of important business, so also the
						vacation times of festivals. And, to contract all in a word,
						rest is the sauce of labor. Nor is it thus in living creatures
						only, but in things inanimate too. For even in bows and
						harps, we loosen their strings, that we-may bend and wind
						them up again. Yea, it is universally seen that, as the body
						is maintained by repletion and evacuation, so is the mind by
						employment and relaxation.</p>
            <p>Those parents, moreover, are to be blamed who, when
						they have committed their sons to the care of pedagogues
						or schoolmasters, never see or hear them perform their
						tasks; wherein they fail much of their duty. For they
						ought, ever and anon, after the intermission of some days,
						to make trial of their children's proficiency; and not intrust their hopes of them to the discretion of a hireling.
						For even that sort of men will take more care of the
						children, when they know that they are regularly to be
						called to account. And here the saying of the king's
						groom is very applicable, that nothing made the horse
						so fat as the king's eye.</p>
            <pb id="v.1.p.22"/>
            <p>But we must most of all exercise and keep in constant employment the memory of children; for that is, as it were,
						the storehouse of all learning. Wherefore the mythologist have made Mnemosyne, or Memory, the mother of the
						Muses, plainly intimating thereby that nothing doth so
						beget or nourish learning as memory. Wherefore we must
						employ it to both those purposes, whether the children be
						naturally apt or backward to remember. For so shall we
						both strengthen it in those to whom Nature in this respect
						hath been bountiful, and supply that to others wherein she
						hath been deficient. And as the former sort of boys will
						thereby come to excel others, so will the latter sort excel
						themselves. For that of Hesiod was well said,&mdash;

					       </p>
            <p>Neither, therefore, let the parents be ignorant of this,
						that the exercising of memory in the schools doth not
						only give the greatest assistance towards the attainment of
						learning, but also to all the actions of life. For the remembrance of things past affords us examples in our consults
						about things to come.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="14">
            <p>Children ought to be made to abstain from speaking
						filthily, seeing, as Democritus said, words are but the

						from being odious in conversation, if they will not be
						pertinaciously bent to maintain all they say in dispute.

            <p>Add we now to these things some others of which children ought to have no less, yea, rather greater care; to wit,
						that they avoid luxurious living, bridle their tongues, subdue anger, and refrain their hands. Of how great moment
						each of these counsels is, I now come to inquire; and we
						may best judge of them by examples. To begin with the
						last: some men there have been, who, by opening their
						hands to take what they ought not, have lost all the honor
						they got in the former part of their lives. So Gylippus
						the Lacedaemonian,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The story is related by our author at large, in the Life of Lysander. It is this:
							Lysander sent by Gylippus to the Ephori, or chief magistrates of Sparta, a great
							sum of money, sealed up in bags. Gylippus unsews the bags at the bottom, and
							takes what he thinks fit out of each bag, and sews them up again; but was discovered, partly by the notes which were put in the bags by Lysander, mentioning
							the sums in each bag; and partly by his own servant, who, when the magistrates
							were solicitous to find what was become of the money that was wating, told them
							jestingly that there were a great many owls under the tiles at his master's house
							(for the money had that bird, as the badge of Athens, where it was coined, stamped
							on it); whither they sent, and found it.</note> for unsewing the public money-bags,
						was condemned to banishment from Sparta. And to be able
						also to subdue anger is the part of a wise man. Such a
						one was Socrates; for when a hectoring and debauched
						young man rudely kicked him, so that those in his company, being sorely offended, were ready to run after him
						and call him to account for it, What, said he to them,
						if an ass had kicked me, would you think it handsomely
						done to kick him again? And yet the young man himself
						escaped not unpunished; for when all persons reproached
						him for so unworthy an act, and gave him the nickname
						of <foreign lang="greek">*laktisth/s,</foreign> or the kicker, he hanged himself. The same
						Socrates,&mdash;when Aristophanes, publishing his play which
						he called the Clouds, therein threw all sorts of the foulest
						reproaches upon him, and a friend of his, who was present
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.24"/>
						
						 at the acting of it, repeated to him what was there
						said in the same comical manner, asking him withal,
						Does not this offend you, Socrates?&mdash;replied: Not at all,
						for I can as well bear with a fool in a play as at a great
						feast. And something of the same nature is reported to
						have been done by Archytas of Tarentum and Plato.
						Archytas, when, upon his return from the war, wherein he
						had been a general, he was informed that his land had
						been impaired by his bailiff's negligence, sent for him, and
						said only thus to him when he came: If I were not very
						angry with thee, I would severely correct thee. And
						Plato, being offended with a gluttonous and debauched
						servant, called to him Speusippus, his sister's son, and said
						unto him: Go beat thou this fellow; for I am too much
						offended with him to do it myself.</p>
            <p>These things, you will perhaps say, are very difficult to
						be imitated. I confess it; but yet we must endeavor to the
						utmost of our power, by setting such examples before us,
						to repress the extravagancy of our immoderate, furious
						anger. For neither are we able to rival the experience or
						virtue of such men in many other matters; but we do,
						nevertheless, as sacred interpreters of divine mysteries and
						priests of wisdom, strive to follow these examples, and, as
						it were, to enrich ourselves with what we can nibble from
						them.</p>
            <p>And as to the bridling of the tongue, concerning which
						also I am obliged to speak, if any man think it a small
						matter or of mean concernment, he is much mistaken.
						For it is a point of wisdom to be silent when occasion requires, and better than to speak, though never so well.
						And, in my judgment, for this reason the ancients instituted mystical rites of initiation in religion, that, being in
						them accustomed to silence, we might thence transfer the
						fear we have of the Gods to the fidelity required in human
						secrets. Yea, indeed, experience shows that no man ever
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.25"/>
						
						repented of having kept silence; but many that they have
						not done so. And a man may, when he will, easily utter
						what he hath by silence concealed; but it is impossible for
						him to recall what he hath once spoken. And, moreover,
						I can remember infinite examples that have been told me
						of those that have procured great damages to themselves
						by intemperance of the tongue; one or two of which I will
						give, omitting the rest. When Ptolemaeus Philadelphus
						had taken his sister Arsinoe to wife, Sotades for breaking
						an obscene jest<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <foreign lang="greek">*ei)s ou)x o(si/hn trumali/hn to\ ke/ntron w)qei=s.</foreign>
               </note> upon him lay languishing in prison a
						great while; a punishment which he deserved for his unseasonable babbling, whereby to provoke laughter in others
						he purchased a long time of mourning to himself. Much
						after the same rate, or rather still worse, did Theocritus the
						Sophist both talk and suffer. For when Alexander commanded the Grecians to provide him a purple robe, wherein, upon his return from the wars, he meant to sacrifice to
						the Gods in gratitude for his victorious success against the
						barbarians, and the various states were bringing in the
						sums assessed upon them, Theocritus said: I now see
						clearly that this is what Homer calls purple death, which
						I never understood before. By which speech he made the
						king his enemy from that time forwards. The same person
						provoked Antigonus, the king of Macedonia, to great wrath,
						by reproaching him with his defect, as having but one eye.
						Thus it was. Antigonus commanded Eutropion his mastercook (then in waiting) to go to this Theocritus and settle
						some accounts with him. And when he announced his
						errand to Theocritus, and called frequently about the business, the latter said: I know that thou hast a mind to dish
						me up raw to that Cyclops; thus reproaching at once the
						king with the want of his eye, and the cook with his employment. To which Eutropion replied: Then thou shalt
						lose thy head, as the penalty of thy loquacity and madness
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.26"/>
						
						And he was as good as his word; for he departed and informed the king, who sent and put Theocritus to death.</p>
            <p>Besides all these things, we are to accustom children to
						speak the truth, and to account it, as indeed it is, a matter
						of religion for them to do so. For lying is a servile quality,
						deserving the hatred of all mankind; yea, a fault for which
						we ought not to forgive our meanest servants.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="15">
            <p>Thus far have I discoursed concerning the goodbreeding of children, and the sobriety requisite to that age,
						without any hesitation or doubt in my own mind concerning any thing that I have said. But in what remains to be
						said, I am dubious and divided in my own thoughts, which,
						as if they were laid in a balance, sometimes incline this,
						and sometimes that way. I am therefore loath to persuade
						or dissuade in the matter. But I must venture to answer
						one question, which is this: whether we ought to admit
						those that make love to our sons to keep them company, or
						whether we should not rather thrust them out of doors, and
						banish them from their society. For when I look upon
						those straightforward parents, of a harsh and austere temper, who think it an outrage not to be endured that their
						sons should have any thing to say to lovers, I am tender
						of being the persuader or encourager of such a practice.
						But, on the other side, when I call to mind Socrates, and
						Plato, and Xenophon, and Aeschines, and Cebes, with an
						whole troop of other such men, who have approved those
						masculine loves, and still have brought up young men to
						learning, public employments, and virtuous living, I am

						of their affection, and admit altogether such as direct the
						love to the soul; whence such loves are to be avoided
						as are in Thebes and Elis, and that sort which in Crete they
						call ravishment (<foreign lang="greek">a(rpagmo/s</foreign>);<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See Strabo X. pp. 483, 484.</note> and such are to be imitated as

            <p>But in this matter let every man follow his own
						judgment. Thus far have I discoursed concerning the right
						ordering and decent carriage of children. I will now pass
						thence, to speak somewhat concerning the next age, that
						of youth. For I have often blamed the evil custom of
						some, who commit their boys in childhood to pedagogues
						and teachers, and then suffer the impetuosity of their youth
						to range without restraint; whereas boys of that age need
						to be kept under a stricter guard than children. For who
						does not know that the errors of childhood are small, and
						perfectly capable of being amended; such as slighting their
						pedagogues, or disobedience to their teachers' instructions.
						But when they begin to grow towards maturity, their
						offences are oftentimes very great and heinous; such as
						gluttony, pilfering money from their parents, dicing, revellings, drunkenness, courting of maidens, and defiling of
						marriage-beds. Wherefore it is expedient that such impetuous heats should with great care be kept under and
						restrained. For the ripeness of that age admits no bounds
						in its pleasures, is skittish, and needs a curb to check it;
						so that those parents who do not hold in their sons with
						great strength about that time find to their surprise that
						they are giving their vicious inclinations full swing in the
						pursuit of the vilest actions. Wherefore it is a duty incumbent
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.28"/>
						
						 upon wise parents, in that age especially, to set a
						strict watch upon them, and to keep them within the bounds
						of sobriety by instructions, threatening, entreaties, counsels,
						promises, and by laying before them examples of those
						men (on one side) who by immoderate love of pleasures
						have brought themselves into great mischief, and of those
						(on the other) who by abstinence in the pursuit of them
						have purchased to themselves very great praise and glory.
						For these two things (hope of honor, and fear of punishment) are, in a sort, the first elements of virtue; the former
						whereof spurs men on the more eagerly to the pursuit of
						honest studies, while the latter blunts the edge of their
						inclinations to vicious courses.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="17">
            <p>And in sum, it is necessary to restrain young men
						from the conversation of debauched persons, lest they take
						infection from their evil examples. This was taught by
						Pythagoras in certain enigmatical sentences, which I shall
						here relate and expound, as being greatly useful to further
						virtuous inclinations. Such are these. Taste not of fish
						that have black tails; that is, converse not with men that
						are smutted with vicious qualities. Stride not over the
						beam of the scales; wherein he teacheth us the regard we
						ought to have for justice, so as not to go beyond its measures. Sit not on a choenix; wherein he forbids sloth, and
						requires us to take care to provide ourselves with the necessaries of life. Do not strike hands with every man; he
						means we ought not to be over hasty to make acquaintances
						or friendships with others. Wear not a tight ring; that
						is, we are to labor after a free and independent way of
						living, and to submit to no fetters. Stir not up the fire
						with a sword; signifying that we ought not to provoke a
						man more when he is angry already (since this is a most
						unseemly act), but we should rather comply with him while
						his passion is in its heat. Eat not thy heart; which forbids
						to afflict our souls, and waste them with vexatious cares
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.29"/>
						
						Abstain from beans; that is, keep out of public offices,
						for anciently the choice of the officers of state was made
						by beans. Put not food in a chamber-pot; Wherein he
						declares that elegant discourse ought not to be put into an
						impure mind; for discourse is the food of the mind, which
						is rendered unclean by the foulness of the man who receives
						it. When men are arrived at the goal, they should not
						turn back; that is, those who are near the end of their
						days, and see the period of their lives approaching,
						ought to entertain it contentedly, and not to be grieved
						at it.</p>
            <p>But to return from this digression,&mdash;our children, as I
						have said, are to be debarred the company of all evil men,
						but especially flatterers. For I would still affirm what I
						have often said in the presence of divers fathers, that there
						is not a more pestilent sort of men than these, nor any that
						more certainly and speedily hurry youth into precipices.
						Yea, they utterly ruin both fathers and sons, making the
						old age of the one and the youth of the other full of sorrow,
						while they cover the hook of their evil counsels with the unavoidable bait of voluptuousness. Parents, when they have
						good estates to leave their children, exhort them to sobriety,
						flatterers to drunkenness; parents exhort to continence,
						these to lasciviousness; parents to good husbandry, these
						to prodigality; parents to industry, these to slothfulness.
						And they usually entertain them with such discourses as
						these: The whole life of man is but a point of tine; let
						us enjoy it therefore while it lasts, and not spend it to no
						purpose. Why should you so much regard the displeasure
						of your father?&mdash;an old doting fool, with one foot already
						in the grave, and 'tis to be hoped it will not be long ere we
						carry him thither altogether. And some of them there are
						who procure young men foul harlots, yea, prostitute wives
						to them; and they even make a prey of those things which
						the careful fathers have provided for the sustenance of their
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.30"/>
						
						old age. A cursed tribe! True friendship's hypocrites,
						they have no knowledge of plain dealing and frank speech.
						They flatter the rich, and despise the poor; and they seduce
						the young, as by a musical charm. When those who feed
						them begin to laugh, then they grin and show their teeth.
						They are mere counterfeits, bastard pretenders to humanity,
						living at the nod and beck of the rich; free by birth, yet
						slaves by choice, who always think themselves abused
						when they are not so, because they are not supported in
						idleness at others' cost. Wherefore, if fathers have any
						care for the good breeding of their children, they ought to
						drive such foul beasts as these out of doors. They ought
						also to keep them from the companionship of vicious
						school-fellows, for these are able to corrupt the most ingenuous dispositions.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="18">
            <p>These counsels which I have now given are of great
						worth and importance; what I have now to add touches
						certain allowances that are to be made to human nature.
						Again therefore I would not have fathers of an over-rigid
						and harsh temper, but so mild as to forgive some slips of
						youth, remembering that they themselves were once young.
						But as physicians are wont to mix their bitter medicines
						with sweet syrups, to make what is pleasant a vehicle for
						what is wholesome, so should fathers temper the keenness
						of their reproofs with lenity. They may occasionally loosen
						the reins, and allow their children to take some liberties
						they are inclined to, and again, when it is fit, manage them
						with a straighter bridle. But chiefly should they bear their
						errors without passion, if it may be; and if they chance to be
						heated more than ordinary, they ought not to suffer the
						flame to burn long. For it is better that a father's anger
						be hasty than severe; because the heaviness of his wrath,
						joined with unplacableness, is no small argument of hatred
						towards the child. It is good also not to discover the
						notice they take of divers faults, and to transfer to such
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.31"/>
						
						cases that dimness of sight and hardness of hearing that
						are wont to accompany old age; so as sometimes not to
						hear what they hear, nor to see what they see, of their
						children's miscarriages. We use to bear with some failings
						in our friends, and it is no wonder if we do the like to our
						children, especially when we sometimes overlook drunkenness in our very servants. Thou hast at times been too
						straight-handed to thy son; make him at other whiles a larger
						allowance. Thou hast, it may be, been too angry with
						him; pardon him the next fault to make him amends.
						He hath made use of a servant's wit to circumvent thee in
						something; restrain thy anger. He hath made bold to
						take a yoke of oxen out of the pasture, or he hath come
						home smelling of his yesterday's drink; take no notice of
						it; and if of ointments too, say nothing. For by this means
						the wild colt sometimes is made more tame. Besides, for
						those who are intemperate in their youthful lusts, and will
						not be amended by reproof, it is good to provide wives; for
						marriage is the strongest bond to hamper wild youth withal.
						But we must take care that the wives we procure for them
						be neither of too noble a birth nor of too great a portion to
						suit their circumstances; for it is a wise saying, drive on
						your own track.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">This saying, <foreign lang="greek">*th\n kata\ sauto\n e)/la</foreign> is attributed to Pittacus of Mitylene by Dio
							genes Laertius, I. 4, 8. See also Aristoph. Nub. 25, and Aesch. Prom 890. (G.)</note> Whereas men that marry women very
						much superior to themselves are not so truly husbands to
						their wives, as they are unawares made slaves to their portions. I will add a few words more, and put an end to
						these advices. The chiefest thing that fathers are to look
						to is, that they themselves become effectual examples to
						their children, by doing all those things which belong to
						them and avoiding all vicious practices, that in their lives,
						as in a glass, their children may see enough to give them
						an aversion to all ill words and actions. For those that
						chide children for such faults as they themselves fall into
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.32"/>
						
						unconsciously accuse themselves, under their children's
						names. And if they are altogether vicious in their own
						lives, they lose the right of reprehending their very servants, and much more do they forfeit it towards their sons.
						Yea, what is more than that, they make themselves even
						counsellors and instructors to them in wickedness. For
						where old men are impudent, there of necessity must the
						young men be so too. Wherefore we are to apply our
						minds to all such practices as may conduce to the good
						breeding of our children. And here we may take example
						from Eurydice of Hierapolis, who, although she was an
						Illyrian, and so thrice a barbarian, yet applied herself to
						learning when she was well advanced in years, that she
						might teach her children. Her love towards her children
						appears evidently in this Epigram of hers, which she dedicated to the Muses:&mdash;
						
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>Eurydice to the Muses here doth raise</l>
							           <l>This monument, her honest love to praise;</l>
							           <l>Who her grown sons that she might scholars breed,</l>
							           <l>Then well in years, herself first learned to read.</l>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have I finished the precepts which I designed
						to give concerning this subject. But that they should all
						be followed by any one reader is rather, I fear, to be wished
						than hoped. And to follow the greater part of them,
						though it may not be impossible to human nature, yet will
						need a concurrence of more than ordinary diligence joined
						with good fortune.</p>
