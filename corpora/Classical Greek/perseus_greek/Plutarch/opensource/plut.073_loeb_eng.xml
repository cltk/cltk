            <head>ON HAVING MANY FRIENDS (DE AMICORUM MULTITUDINE) <lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p> Plutarch's essay on friendship may possibly have been offered on some
					occasion as a lecture, but there is nothing to prove or disprove this
					assumption. From what we know of Plutarch's relations to his friends we can
					well believe that he was singularly happy in his friendships, and hence well
					fitted to speak on the subject. He was familiar, too, with the literature
					dealing with friendship, and the result is an essay well worth reading.
					Cicero's essay on friendship (De amicitia) may profitably be compared with
					Plutarch's. </p>
            <p> Two or three emendations of a more radical nature have been adopted in the
					text, in the effort to make it intelligible: for example, in 96 a the
					translation probably gives the right sense of the passage, as Wyttenbach
					seemed to see, but whether the emendation is right is more doubtful. Even
					more doubtful is Paton's <foreign lang="greek">prosentei/nein</foreign>,
					based on an even more dubious emendation of <foreign lang="greek">e)ntei/nasqai</foreign> in the quotation from Euripides ; for Plutarch
					would not be apt to refer to an aorist middle by a present active form. In
					these matters Plutarch was more careful than Paton. </p>

            <p>Meno,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Meno</hi> 71 E.</note> the Thessalian, who felt that he had had a good training in debating,
					and, to quote Empedocles' familiar expression, was <quote rend="blockquote">Haunting the lofty

               </quote> was asked by Socrates what virtue is ; and when he
					replied impulsively and promptly that there is a virtue appropriate to a
					child and to an old man, to a grown man and to a woman, to a public official
					and to a private citizen, to a master and to a servant, Socrates exclaimed,
					<q direct="unspecified">A fine answer ! for when asked for one virtue you have stirred

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi> 441 B.</note> inferring, not badly, that it was
					because the man knew not a single virtue that he was naming so many. And
					might not we also be subject to ridicule because we, who are not yet in
					secure possession of one friendship, are afraid that we may unwittingly
					become involved in a multitude of friendships ? We hardly differ at all from
					a man who, being maimed or blind, is afraid that he may become a Briareus of
					the hundred hands or an Argus all-seeing. And yet we commend above measure
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.49"/> the youth in Menander's play <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The <hi rend="italics">Epiclerus</hi>. Kock, <hi rend="italics">Com. Attic. Frag.</hi> iii., Menander, No. 554. See also Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 479 C, where four lines of the play are quoted, and Allinson, <hi rend="italics">Menander</hi> (in the L.C.L.), p. 493.</note> who says that any man
					counts it a marvellous good thing <quote rend="blockquote">If he but have the shadow of a friend.</quote>
				        </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>One thing which stands out among many others, as particularly antagonistic to
					our acquisition of friendship, is the craving for numerous friends, which is
					like that of licentious women, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Lucian, <hi rend="italics">Tozaris</hi>, 37.</note> for because of our frequent intimacies with
					many different persons we cannot keep our hold on our earlier associates,
					who are neglected and drift away. A better comparison, perhaps, is the
					nursling of Hypsipyle, who seated himself in the meadow, and <quote rend="blockquote">One after
						another caught up Handfuls of flowers with joyful heart, But with
						childhood's yearning unsated.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Presumably from the <hi rend="italics">Hypsipyle</hi> of Euripides, <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag.,</hi> Euripides, No. 754. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> also Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 661 F.</note>
               </quote> So it is with all of us : because anything
					new attracts us but soon palls on us, it is always the recent and freshly
					blooming friend that allures us and makes us change our minds, even while we
					are busy with many beginnings of friendship and intimacy at the same time,
					which go but little further, since, in our longing for the person we pursue,
					we pass over the one already within our grasp. </p>
            <p> In the first place, then, let us begin at the hearthstone, as the saying is,
					with the story of men's lives which history <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plutarch is considering Greek history only.</note> has left us regarding steadfast
					friends, and let us take as witness and counsellor in our discussion the
					long and distant ages in which are mentioned, as paired in the bond of
					friendship, Theseus and Peiritho&uuml;s, Achilles and Patroclus, 
					<pb id="v.2.p.51"/> Orestes and Pylades, Phintias and Damon, Epameinondas
					and Pelopidas. For friendship is a creature that seeks a companion ; it is
					not like cattle and crows that flock and herd together, and to look upon
					one's friend as another self and to call him <q direct="unspecified">brother</q> as
					though to suggest <q direct="unspecified">th'other,</q> is nothing but a way of using
					duality as a measure of friendship. It is impossible to acquire either many
					slaves or many friends with little coin. What then is the coin of friendship
					? It is goodwill and graciousness combined with virtue, than which nature
					has nothing more rare. It follows, then, that a strong mutual friendship
					with many persons is impossible, but, just as rivers whose waters are
					divided among many branches and channels flow weak and thin, so affection,
					naturally strong in a soul, if portioned out among many persons becomes
					utterly enfeebled. This is the reason why, in the case of animals, love for
					their young is more strongly implanted by nature in those that give birth to
					but one at a time ; and Homer's <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi>, ix. 482; <hi rend="italics">Odyssey</hi>, xvi. 19.</note> name for a beloved son is <q direct="unspecified">the only
						one, child of our eld,</q> that is to say, born to parents who
					neither have nor can ever have another child. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>We do not maintain that our friend should be <q direct="unspecified">the only one,</q>
					but along with others let there be some <q direct="unspecified">child of our eld</q>
					and <q direct="unspecified">late-begotten,</q> as it were, who has consumed with us in
					the course of time the proverbial bushel of salt, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 482 B; Cicero, <hi rend="italics">De amicitia</hi>, 19 (67); Aristotle, <hi rend="italics">Eth. Nicom.</hi> viii. 3.</note> not as is the fashion
					nowadays, by which many get the name of friend by drinking a single glass
					together, or by playing ball or gambling together, or by spending a night
					under the same roof, and so pick up a friendship from inn, gymnasium, or
					market-place. </p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.53"/>
            <p> In the houses of rich men and rulers, the people see a noisy throng of
					visitors offering their greetings and shaking hands and playing the part of
					armed retainers, and they think that those who have so many friends must be
					happy. Yet they can see a far greater number of flies in those persons'
					kitchens. But the flies do not stay on after the good food is gone, nor the
					retainers after their patron's usefulness is gone. But true friendship seeks
					after three things above all else: virtue as a good thing, intimacy as a
					pleasant thing, and usefulness as a necessary thing, for a man ought to use
					judgement before accepting a friend, and to enjoy being with him and to use
					him when in need of him, and all these things stand in the way of one's
					having many friends ; but most in the way is the first (which is the most
					important)&mdash;the approval through judgement. Therefore we must, in
					the first place, consider whether it is possible in a brief period of time
					to test dancers who are to dance together, or rowers who are to pull
					together, or servants who are to be guardians of property or attendants of
					children, let alone the testing of a multitude of friends who are to strip
					for a general contest with every kind of fortune, each one of whom <quote rend="blockquote">Puts his
						successes with the common store, And shares in bad luck, too, without
						distress.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Author unknown; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag.</hi>, Adespota, No. 366.</note>
               </quote> For no ship is launched upon the sea to meet so many storms, nor
					do men, when they erect protecting walls for strongholds, and dams and moles
					for harbours, anticipate perils so numerous and so great as those from which
					friendship, rightly and surely tried, <pb id="v.2.p.55"/> promises a refuge
					and protection. But when some thrust their friendship upon us without being
					tried, and are found to be like bad coins when put to the test, <quote rend="blockquote">Those who
						are bereft rejoice, And those who have them pray for some escape.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">From some play of Sophocles; it is cited again by Plutarch in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 768 E; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi>Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag.</hi>, Sophocles, No. 779.</note>
               </quote> But here
					is the difficulty&mdash;that it is not easy to escape or to put aside an
					unsatisfactory friendship ; but as harmful and disquieting food can neither
					be retained without causing pain and injury, nor ejected in the form in
					which it was taken in, but only as a disgusting and repulsive mess, so an
					unprincipled friend either causes pain and intense discomfort by his
					continued association, or else with accompanying enmity and hostility is
					forcibly ejected like bile. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>We ought therefore not to accept readily chance acquaintances, or attach
					ourselves to them, nor ought we to make friends of those who seek after us,
					but rather we should seek after those who are worthy of friendship. For one
					should by no means take what can be easily taken. In fact we step over or
					thrust aside bramble and brier, which seize hold upon us, and make our way
					onward to the olive and the vine.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 709 E.</note> Thus it is always an excellent thing not
					to make an intimate acquaintance of the man who is ready with his embraces,
					but rather, of our own motion, to embrace those of whom we approve as worthy
					of our attention and useful to us. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>Just as Zeuxis,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Life of Pericles</hi>, chap. xiii. (p. 159 D).</note> when some persons charged him with painting slowly, retorted
					by saying, <q direct="unspecified">Yes, it takes me a long time, for it is to last
						long,</q> so it is necessary to preserve friendship and intimacy by
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.57"/> adopting them only after spending a long time in passing
					judgement upon them. Is it, then, true that while it is not easy to pass
					judgement on a large number of friends, yet it is easy to associate with a
					large number at the same time, or is this also impossible ? Now it is a fact
					that the enjoyment of friendship lies in its intimacy, and the pleasantest
					part of it is found in association and daily companionship: <quote rend="blockquote">Never in life
						again shall we take counsel together Sitting apart from our comrades.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xxiii. 77; the words are spoken by the ghost of Patroclus to Achilles.</note>
               </quote> And
					in regard to Odysseus, Menelaus says : <quote rend="blockquote">Else there were nothing Which could
						have parted us twain in the midst of our love and enjoyment; No, not till
						Death's dark cloud had wrapped its shadow around us.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> iv. 178; Plutarch quoted the first two lines in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 54 F.</note>
               </quote> Now what is commonly
					called having a multitude of friends apparently produces the opposite
					result. For friendship draws persons together and unites them and keeps them
					united in a close fellowship by means of continual association and mutual
					acts of kindness&mdash; Just as the fig-juice fastens the white milk
					firmly and binds it, as Empedocles <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Probably adapted by Empedocles from Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi>v. 902; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi>Diels, <hi rend="italics">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</hi>, i. p. 239.</note> puts it (for such is the unity and
					consolidation that true friendship desires to effect) ; but, on the other
					hand, having a multitude of friends causes disunion, separation, and
					divergence, since, by calling one hither and thither, and transferring one's
					attention now to this person, now to that, it does not permit any blending
					or close attachment of goodwill to take place in the intimacy which moulds
					itself about friendship and takes enduring <pb id="v.2.p.59"/> form. This at
					once suggests also the inequality there must be and embarrassment about
					rendering services, since the very useful elements in friendship are
					rendered practically useless by having many friends. For <quote rend="blockquote">In divers men
						solicitude excites conduct diverse.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Bergk, <hi rend="italics">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</hi> iii. p. 721, Adespota, No. 99.</note>
               </quote> For neither do our natures tend in the
					same direction as our impulses, nor do we, day in and day out, meet with the
					same sort of fortune ; and the occasions which prompt our various actions,

         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>But if all our friends want the same things at the same time, it is hard to
					satisfy all, in either their counsels, their public life, their ambitions,
					or their dispensing of hospitality. And if at one and the same time they
					chance to be occupied in diverse activities and experiences, and call upon
					us at the same instant, one to join him on a voyage to foreign parts,

				        </p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.61"/>
            <p> Yet people are more tolerant of acts of negligence and remissness on the
					part of their friends, and they accept from them without anger such excuses
					as <q direct="unspecified">I forgot,</q>
					          <q direct="unspecified">I didn't know.</q> But the man who says, <q direct="unspecified">I did not appear
						with you when your case was in court, for I was appearing with another
						friend,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">I did not come and see you when you had
							fever, for I was busy helping so-and-so to entertain some
							friends,</q> thus alleging, as the reason for his inattention, his
					attention to others, does not absolve himself from blame, but only
					aggravates the trouble by arousing jealousy. But most people, apparently,
					look at the possession of a host of friends merely from the point of view of
					what such friendships are able to bestow, and overlook what these demand in
					return, forgetting that he who accepts the services of many for his needs
					must in turn render like service to many in their need. Therefore, just as
					Briareus in purveying for fifty bellies with an hundred hands had no
					advantage over us who manage one stomach with what two hands provide, so in
					making use of many friends is involved also serving many, and sharing in
					their anxieties, preoccupations, and troubles. For no credence is to be
					given to Euripides <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Hippolytus</hi>, 253.</note> when he says: <quote rend="blockquote">In the friendship which mortals with each

					one's friendship or hauling it close according to exigencies, like the sheet
					of a ship's sail. But let us, my dear Euripides, turn the application
					<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Hippolytus, 253.</note>
					          <pb id="v.2.p.63"/> of this advice to our enmities, and advise the use of

					intolerable for free-born and generous persons. </p>

            <p>For these reasons it is not a fit thing to be thus unsparing of our virtue,
					uniting and intertwining it now with one and now with another, but rather
					only with those who are qualified to keep up the same participation, that is
					to say, those who are able, in a like manner, to love and participate. For
					herein plainly is the greatest obstacle of all to having a multitude of
					friends, in that friendship comes into
					<pb id="v.2.p.67"/> being through likeness. Indeed, if even the brute beasts
					are made to mate with others unlike themselves only by forcible compulsion,
					and crouch aside, and show resentment as they try to escape from each other,
					while with animals of their own race and kind they consort with mutual
					satisfaction, and welcome the participation with a ready goodwill, how then
					is it possible for friendship to be engendered in differing characters,
					unlike feelings, and lives which hold to other principles ? It is true that
					the harmony produced on harp and lyre gets its consonance through tones of
					dissonant pitch, a likeness being somehow engendered between the higher and
					the lower notes ; but in our friendship's consonance and harmony there must
					be no element unlike, uneven, or unequal, but all must be alike to engender
					agreement in words, counsels, opinions, and feelings, and it must be as if
					one soul were apportioned among two or more bodies. </p>

            <p>What man is there, then, so indefatigable, so changeable, so universally

					one character to another, reading books with the scholarly, rolling in the
					dust with wrestlers, following the hunt with sportsmen, getting drunk with
					topers, and taking part in the canvass of politicians, possessing no firmly
					founded character of his own. And as the natural philosophers say of the
					formless and colourless substance and material which is the underlying basis
					of everything and of itself turns into everything, that it is now in a state
					of combustion, now liquefied, at another time aeriform, and then again
					solid, so the possession of a multitude of friends will necessarily have, as
					its underlying basis, a soul that is very impressionable, versatile, pliant,
					and readily changeable. But friendship seeks for a fixed and steadfast
					character which does not shift about, but continues in one place and in one
					intimacy. For this reason a steadfast friend is something rare and hard to
					find. <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, Od. iv. 383 ff; Virgil, Georgics, iv. 387 ff.</note>
