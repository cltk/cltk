            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> The managers of the affairs of the commonwealth were one hundred and eighty men; out of these
					they elected senators, which they called <foreign lang="greek">a)/rtunoi. </foreign>The most

				called Onobatis?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> This was one of the women taken in adultery, which they brought into the market-place, and set
					her upon a certain stone to be seen of all; from thence
					they took her and set her on ass-back, and led her round
					about the city, and afterwards set her up again upon the
					stone; the rest of her life she led under disgrace. Her
					they called Onobatis (the woman that rode upon an ass);
					hence they abominated the stone as unclean. There was
					also a certain magistrate among them, called Phylactes
					(a conservator); he that had this office kept the prison for
					the rest of his time; but at the nocturnal convention of the
					senators he came into the council, and laying hands on the
					kings led them forth, and detained them in custody until
					the senate had determined concerning them, by a vote
					given in private, whether they had acted unrighteously
					or not.</p>

               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> The sixty select men chosen from among the
					nobles, whom they used as overseers and principal counsellors for life in matters of greatest concern, they called
					Amnemones (as a man may suppose) because they were
					not accountable to any for what they did, or verily (in my

            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> When the Lacedaemonians were agreed with

				who is called <foreign lang="greek">(*osiwth/r</foreign>? And why do they call one of the
				months Bysius?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> They call the slain sacrifice <foreign lang="greek">(*osiwth/r</foreign> when the
					<foreign lang="greek">o(/ios</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">the holy one</hi>) is declared. There are five of these
					holy ones for life, and these transact many things with the
					prophets, and sacrifice together with them, supposing that
					they are descended from Deucalion. The month Bysius,
					as many think, is the same as <foreign lang="greek">*fu/sios</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">natural</hi>), for it is in
					the beginning of the spring, when most things do sprout
					and put forth buds. But this is not the true reason. For
					the Delphians do not use <hi rend="italics">b</hi> for <hi rend="italics">ph</hi> (as the Macedonians,
					who say Bilippus, Balacrus, and Beronica, for Philippus,
					Phalacrus, and Pheronica), but instead of <hi rend="italics">p;</hi> they for the
					most part saying <foreign lang="greek">batei=n</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">patei=n</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">bikro/n</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">pikro/n</foreign>. Therefore they say Bysius for Pysius, because in that month they
					enquire of and consult their God Apollo. This is their
					genuine and country way of speaking. For in that month
					an oracle is given forth, and they call that week the nativity of Apollo, and the name is Polythous, not because of
					their baking a sort of cakes called Pthides, but because
					then their oracle is full of answers and prophecies. For
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.268"/>
					
					it is but of late that oraculous answers were given to the
					enquirers every month. In former times Pythia gave answers only once a year, which was on this day, as Callisthenes and Anaxandridas have told us.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> It is one of the small plants that creep upon
					the ground, upon whose branches the cattle treading do
					hinder, hurt, and spoil their growth. Where therefore
					they have attained some considerable bigness by growth,

            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> The Eretrians inhabited the island of Corcyra. But when Charicrates set sail from Corinth with a
					considerable strength and overcame them in battle, the
					Eretrians took shipping and sailed to their native country;
					of which thing the inhabitants of that country having
					timely notice, gave them a repulse, and by slinging stones
					at them impeded their landing. Now being not able either
					to persuade or force their way, seeing the multitude was
					implacably bent against them, they sailed into Thrace and
					took possession of that country, where they say Metho
					first inhabited, of whose offspring Orpheus was. The city
					therefore they call Methone, and of the neighboring inhabitants the men are called Aposphendoneti, i.e. they that
					were repulsed with sling-stones.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Question</hi> 12. What was Charila among the Delphians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> The Delphians solemnized three nonennial
					feasts in regular order, of which they call one Stepterium,
					another Herois, and the third Charila. The Stepterium
					represents by imitation the fight which Apollo had with
					Python, and both his flight and pursuit after the fight unto
					Tempe. For some say that he fled, as needing purification
					by reason of the slaughter; others say that he pursued
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.269"/>
					
					Python wounded, and flying along the highway which
					they now call Sacred, he just missed of being present at
					his death; for he found him just dead of his wound, and
					buried by his son, whose name was Aix, as they say.
					Stepterium therefore is the representation of these or some
					such things. But as to Herois, it hath for the most part a
					mysterious reason which the Thyades are acquainted with;
					but by the things that are publicly acted one may conjecture it to be the calling up of Semele from the lower
					world. Concerning Charila, they fable some such things
					as these. A famine by reason of drought seized the Delphians, who came with their wives and children as suppliants to the king's gate, whereupon he distributed meal
					and pulse to the better known among them, for there was
					not sufficient for all. A little orphan girl yet coming and
					importuning him, he beat her with his shoe, and threw
					his shoe in her face. She indeed was a poor wandering
					beggar-wench, but was not of an ignoble disposition;
					therefore withdrawing herself, she untied her girdle and
					hanged herself. The famine hereupon increasing and
					many diseases accompanying it, Pythia gives answer to
					the king, that the maid Charila who slew herself must be
					expiated. They with much ado at last discovering that
					this was the maid's name which was smitten with a shoe,
					they instituted a certain sacrifice mixed with expiatory
					rites, which they yet solemnize to this day every ninth
					year. Whereat the king presides, distributing meal and
					pulse to all strangers and citizens (for they introduce a
					kind of an effigy of the wench Charila); and when all
					have received their doles, the king smites the idol with his
					shoe. Upon this the governess of the Thyades takes up the
					image and carries it away to some rocky place, and there
					putting a halter about its neck, they bury it in the place
					where they buried Charila when she had strangled herself.</p>

               <hi rend="italics">Question</hi> 13. What is the beggars' meat among the
				Aenianes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> Many have been the removes of the Aenianes.
					First they inhabited the plain of Dotion; thence they were
					expelled by the Lapithae to the Aethices; from thence
					they betook themselves to a region of Molossia about the
					Aous, where they were called Paravaeans; afterward they
					took possession of Cirrha; they had no sooner landed at
					Cirrha (Apollo so commanding their king Oenoclus) but
					they went down to the country bordering on the river
					Inachus, inhabited by the Inachians and Achaeans. There
					was an oracle given to the latter, that they would lose all
					their country if they should part with any of it,&mdash;and to
					the Aenianes, that they would hold it if they should take
					it of such as freely resigned it. Temo, a noted man among
					the Aenianes, putting on rags and a scrip, like a beggar,
					addressed himself to the Inachians; the king, in a way of
					reproach and scorn, gave him a clod of earth. He receives it and puts it up into his scrip, and absconds himself, making much of his dole; for he presently forsakes
					the country, begging no more. The old men wondering
					at this, the oracle came fresh to their remembrance; and
					going to the king, they told him that he ought not to slight
					this man, nor suffer him to escape. Temo well perceiving
					their designs, hastens his flight, and as he fled, vowed
					a hecatomb to Apollo. Upon this occasion the kings
					fought hand to hand; and when Phemius, the king of
					the Aenianes, saw Hyperochus, the king of the Inachians,
					charging him with a dog at his heels, he said he dealt not
					fairly to bring a second with him to fight him; whereupon
					Hyperochus going to drive away the dog, and turning
					himself about in order to throw a stone at the dog, Phemius slays him. Thus the Aenianes possessed themselves
					of that region, expelling the Inachians and Achaeans;
					but they reverence that stone as sacred, and sacrifice to it,
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.271"/>
					
					wrapping it in the fat of the victim. And when they offer
					a hecatomb to Apollo, they sacrifice an ox to Jupiter, a
					choice part of which they distribute to Temo's posterity,
					and call it the beggars' flesh.</p>

               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> After the slaughter of the suitors, some near
					related to the deceased made head against Ulysses. Neoptolemus, being introduced by both parties as an arbitrator,
					determined that Ulysses should remove and hasten out of
					Cephalenia, Zacynthus, and Ithaca, because of the blood
					that he had shed there; but that the friends and relations
					of the suitors should pay a yearly mulct to Ulysses, for the
					wrong done to his family. Ulysses therefore passed over
					into Italy; the mulct he devoted to his son, and commanded the Ithacans to pay it. The mulct was meal,

               <hi rend="italics">Solution.</hi> Locrus was the son of Fuscius, the son of
					Amphictyon. Of him and Cabya came Locrus, with whom
					his father falling into contention, and gathering after him
					a great number of citizens, consulted the oracle about
					transplanting a colony. The oracle told him that there he
					should build a city, where he should happen to be bit by
					a wooden dog. He, wafting over the sea unto the next
					shore, trod upon a cynosbatus (a sweet brier), and being
					sorely pained with the prick, he spent many days there;
					in which time considering the nature of the country, he
					built Physcus and Hyantheia, and other towns which the

					were called Ozolians (strong-scented people) from Nessus

					by the surf of the sea, and putrefying upon the shore. And
					some say that the men wore pelts and ram-goat skins, living

					were strong-scented. Others contrariwise say that the

					was from their sweet odor; among them that assert this is

					When she died, the Megarians cordially lamented her; and
					Nisus, willing to perpetuate her memory and renown, gave
					command that the Megarian women should dress in apparel
					like unto that which she wore, and that dress they called

					as <q direct="unspecified">into the region of security,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">thou shalt come
						to the seat of pleasure</q>? Or is the reason to be rendered according to that fabulous story, that of all the
					sons of Lycaon Eleuther and Lebadus alone were free
					from that conspiracy against Jupiter, and fled into Boeotia,
					where the Lebadenses use the like civil polity to that of
					the Arcadians, and therefore they send them to Eleutherae
					that enter unwittingly into the inaccessible temple of Jupiter? Or is it (as Architimus saith in his remarks on
					Arcadia) that some that went into the Lycaeum unawares
					were delivered up to the Phliasians by the Arcadians, and
					by the Phliasians to the Megarians, and by the Megarians
					to the Thebans which inhabit about Eleutherae, where
					they are detained under rain, thunder, and other direful
					judgments from Heaven; and upon this account some say
					this place was called Eleutherae. But the report is not
					true that he that enters into the Lycaeum casts no shadow,
					though it hath had a firm belief. And what if this be the
					reason of that report, that the air converted into clouds
					looks darkly on them that go in? Or that he that goes
					in falls down dead?&mdash;for the Pythagoreans say that the
					souls of the deceased do neither give a shadow nor wink.
					Or is it that the sun only makes a shadow, and the law
					bereaveth him that entereth here of the sight of the
					sun? Though this they speak enigmatically; for verily
					he that goes in is called Elaphus, <hi rend="italics">a stag.</hi> Hence the Lacedaemonians delivered up to the Arcadians Cantharion the
					Arcadian, who went over to the Eleans whilst they waged
					war with the Arcadians, passing with his booty through

					was ended; the oracle requiring them to restore the stag.</p>

					of Cephisus and Scias, but they say received his name
					from Eunosta, the nymph that brought him up. This
					man was honest and just, and no less temperate and austere. They say that Ochna his niece fell in love with
					him, who was one of the daughters of Colonus; and when
					he perceived that she tempted him to lie with her, manifesting his indignation he went and accused her to her
					brethren. But she had cried Whore first and provoked
					her brethren, Echimus, Leon, and Bucolus, to kill Eunostus, by her false suggestion that he would have forced
					her; wherefore these laid wait for the young man and
					slew him, upon which Elieus secured them. Now Ochna
					growing penitent and full of terror, as well to discharge
					the grief she had for her beloved as out of commiseration
					towards her brethren, confesses the whole truth to Elicus,
					and he declares it to Colonus, who condemned them.
					Whereupon Ochna's brethren fled, but she broke her neck
					from some high place, as Myrtis the Anthedonian poetess
					hath told us. Therefore he kept the tomb and grove of
					Eunostus from the access and approach of women, insomuch that upon earthquakes, droughts, and other portents
					that often there happened, the Tanagrians made diligent
					search whether any woman had not by stealth got nigh to
					that place. And there are some (of whom Clidamus, a
					man of great fame, is one) who report that Eunostus met
					them as he was going to the sea to wash himself because
					a woman had entered into his grove. Diocles also, in his
