<l n="tr">Before the ocean and the earth appeared&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">before the skies had overspread them all&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">the face of Nature in a vast expanse</l>
<l n="tr">was naught but Chaos uniformly waste.</l>
<l n="tr">It was a rude and undeveloped mass,</l>
<l n="tr">that nothing made except a ponderous weight;</l>
<l n="tr">and all discordant elements confused,</l>
<l n="tr">were there congested in a shapeless heap.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">As yet the sun afforded earth no light,</l>
<l n="tr">nor did the moon renew her crescent horns;</l>
<l n="tr">the earth was not suspended in the air</l>
<l n="tr">exactly balanced by her heavy weight.</l>
<l n="tr">Not far along the margin of the shores</l>
<l n="tr">had Amphitrite stretched her lengthened arms,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">for all the land was mixed with sea and air.</l>
<l n="tr">The land was soft, the sea unfit to sail,</l>
<l n="tr">the atmosphere opaque, to naught was given</l>
<l n="tr">a proper form, in everything was strife,</l>
<l n="tr">and all was mingled in a seething mass&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">with hot the cold parts strove, and wet with dry</l>
<l n="tr">and soft with hard, and weight with empty void.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">But God, or kindly Nature, ended strife&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">he cut the land from skies, the sea from land,</l>
<l n="tr">the heavens ethereal from material air;</l>
<l n="tr">and when were all evolved from that dark mass</l>
<l n="tr">he bound the fractious parts in tranquil peace.</l>
<l n="tr">The fiery element of convex heaven</l>
<l n="tr">leaped from the mass devoid of dragging weight,</l>
<l n="tr">and chose the summit arch to which the air</l>
<l n="tr">as next in quality was next in place.</l>
<l n="tr">The earth more dense attracted grosser parts</l>
<l n="tr">and moved by gravity sank underneath;</l>
<l n="tr">and last of all the wide surrounding waves</l>
<l n="tr">in deeper channels rolled around the globe.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">And when this God &mdash;which one is yet unknown&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">had carved asunder that discordant mass,</l>
<l n="tr">had thus reduced it to its elements,</l>
<l n="tr">that every part should equally combine,</l>
<l n="tr">when time began He rounded out the earth</l>
<l n="tr">and moulded it to form a mighty globe.</l>
<l n="tr">Then poured He forth the deeps and gave command</l>
<l n="tr">that they should billow in the rapid winds,</l>
<l n="tr">that they should compass every shore of earth. </l>
<l n="tr">he also added fountains, pools and lakes,</l>
<l n="tr">and bound with shelving banks the slanting streams,</l>
<l n="tr">which partly are absorbed and partly join</l>
<l n="tr">the boundless ocean. Thus received amid</l>
<l n="tr">the wide expanse of uncontrolled waves,</l>
<l n="tr">they beat the shores instead of crooked banks.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">At His command the boundless plains extend,</l>
<l n="tr">the valleys are depressed, the woods are clothed</l>
<l n="tr">in green, the stony mountains rise. And as</l>
<l n="tr">the heavens are intersected on the right</l>
<l n="tr">by two broad zones, by two that cut the left,</l>
<l n="tr">and by a fifth consumed with ardent heat,</l>
<l n="tr">with such a number did the careful God</l>
<l n="tr">mark off the compassed weight, and thus the earth</l>
<l n="tr">received as many climes.&mdash;Such heat consumes</l>
<l n="tr">the middle zone that none may dwell therein;</l>
<l n="tr">and two extremes are covered with deep snow;</l>
<l n="tr">and two are placed betwixt the hot and cold,</l>
<l n="tr">which mixed together give a temperate clime;</l>
<l n="tr">and over all the atmosphere suspends</l>
<l n="tr">with weight proportioned to the fiery sky,</l>
<l n="tr">exactly as the weight of earth compares</l>
<l n="tr">with weight of water.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">And He ordered mist</l>
<l n="tr">to gather in the air and spread the clouds.</l>
<l n="tr">He fixed the thunders that disturb our souls,</l>
<l n="tr">and brought the lightning on destructive winds</l>
<l n="tr">that also waft the cold. Nor did the great</l>
<l n="tr">Artificer permit these mighty winds</l>
<l n="tr">to blow unbounded in the pathless skies,</l>
<l n="tr">but each discordant brother fixed in space,</l>
<l n="tr">although His power can scarce restrain their rage</l>
<l n="tr">to rend the universe. At His command</l>
<l n="tr">to far Aurora, Eurus took his way,</l>
<l n="tr">to Nabath, <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, and that mountain range</l>
<l n="tr">first gilded by the dawn; and Zephyr's flight</l>
<l n="tr">was towards the evening star and peaceful shores,</l>
<l n="tr">warm with the setting sun; and Boreas</l>
<l n="tr">invaded <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> and the northern snows;</l>
<l n="tr">and Auster wafted to the distant south</l>
<l n="tr">where clouds and rain encompass his abode.&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and over these He fixed the liquid sky,</l>
<l n="tr">devoid of weight and free from earthly dross.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">And scarcely had He separated these</l>
<l n="tr">and fixed their certain bounds, when all the stars,</l>
<l n="tr">which long were pressed and hidden in the mass,</l>
<l n="tr">began to gleam out from the plains of heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">and traversed, with the Gods, bright ether fields:</l>
<l n="tr">and lest some part might be bereft of life</l>
<l n="tr">the gleaming waves were filled with twinkling fish;</l>
<l n="tr">the earth was covered with wild animals;</l>
<l n="tr">the agitated air was filled with birds. </l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">But one more perfect and more sanctified,</l>
<l n="tr">a being capable of lofty thought,</l>
<l n="tr">intelligent to rule, was wanting still</l>
<l n="tr">man was created! Did the Unknown God</l>
<l n="tr">designing then a better world make man</l>
<l n="tr">of seed divine? or did Prometheus</l>
<l n="tr">take the new soil of earth (that still contained</l>
<l n="tr">some godly element of Heaven's Life)</l>
<l n="tr">and use it to create the race of man;</l>
<l n="tr">first mingling it with water of new streams;</l>
<l n="tr">so that his new creation, upright man,</l>
<l n="tr">was made in image of commanding Gods?</l>
<l n="tr">On earth the brute creation bends its gaze,</l>
<l n="tr">but man was given a lofty countenance</l>
<l n="tr">and was commanded to behold the skies;</l>
<l n="tr">and with an upright face may view the stars:&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and so it was that shapeless clay put on</l>
<l n="tr">the form of man till then unknown to earth.</l>

<l n="tr">First was the Golden Age. Then rectitude</l>
<l n="tr">spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith.</l>
<l n="tr">Avengers were not seen, for laws unframed</l>
<l n="tr">were all unknown and needless. Punishment</l>
<l n="tr">and fear of penalties existed not.</l>
<l n="tr">No harsh decrees were fixed on brazen plates.</l>
<l n="tr">No suppliant multitude the countenance</l>
<l n="tr">of Justice feared, averting, for they dwelt</l>
<l n="tr">without a judge in peace. Descended not</l>
<l n="tr">the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine,</l>
<l n="tr">cleaving the trackless waves of alien shores,</l>
<l n="tr">nor distant realms were known to wandering men.</l>
<l n="tr">The towns were not entrenched for time of war;</l>
<l n="tr">they had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns</l>
<l n="tr">of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords.</l>
<l n="tr">There was no thought of martial pomp &mdash;secure</l>
<l n="tr">a happy multitude enjoyed repose.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">Then of her own accord the earth produced</l>
<l n="tr">a store of every fruit. The harrow touched</l>
<l n="tr">her not, nor did the plowshare wound</l>
<l n="tr">her fields. And man content with given food,</l>
<l n="tr">and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits</l>
<l n="tr">and wild strawberries on the mountain sides,</l>
<l n="tr">and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush,</l>
<l n="tr">and corners and sweet acorns on the ground,</l>
<l n="tr">down fallen from the spreading tree of Jove.</l>
<l n="tr">Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed</l>
<l n="tr">and warmly cherished buds and blooms, produced</l>
<l n="tr">without a seed. The valleys though unplowed</l>
<l n="tr">gave many fruits; the fields though not renewed</l>
<l n="tr">white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat:</l>
<l n="tr">rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees,</l>
<l n="tr">the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">When Saturn had been banished into night</l>
<l n="tr">and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme,</l>
<l n="tr">the Silver Age, though not so good as gold</l>
<l n="tr">but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">Jove first reduced to years the Primal Spring,</l>
<l n="tr">by him divided into periods four,</l>
<l n="tr">unequal,&mdash;summer, autumn, winter, spring.&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">then glowed with tawny heat the parched air,</l>
<l n="tr">or pendent icicles in winter froze</l>
<l n="tr">and man stopped crouching in crude caverns, while</l>
<l n="tr">he built his homes of tree rods, bark entwined.</l>
<l n="tr">Then were the cereals planted in long rows,</l>
<l n="tr">and bullocks groaned beneath the heavy yoke.</l>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><l n="tr">The third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze,</l>
<l n="tr">when cruel people were inclined to arms</l>
<l n="tr">but not to impious crimes. And last of all</l>
<l n="tr">the ruthless and hard Age of Iron prevailed,</l>
<l n="tr">from which malignant vein great evil sprung;</l>
<l n="tr">and modesty and faith and truth took flight,</l>
<l n="tr">and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds</l>
<l n="tr">and violence and wicked love of gain,</l>
<l n="tr">succeeded.&mdash;Then the sailor spread his sails</l>
<l n="tr">to winds unknown, and keels that long had stood</l>
<l n="tr">on lofty mountains pierced uncharted waves.</l>
<l n="tr">Surveyors anxious marked with metes and bounds</l>
<l n="tr">the lands, created free as light and air:</l>
<l n="tr">nor need the rich ground furnish only crops,</l>
<l n="tr">and give due nourishment by right required,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">they penetrated to the bowels of earth</l>
<l n="tr">and dug up wealth, bad cause of all our ills,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">rich ores which long ago the earth had hid</l>
<l n="tr">and deep removed to gloomy Stygian caves:</l>
<l n="tr">and soon destructive iron and harmful gold</l>
<l n="tr">were brought to light; and War, which uses both,</l>
<l n="tr">came forth and shook with sanguinary grip</l>
<l n="tr">his clashing arms. Rapacity broke forth&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">the guest was not protected from his host,</l>
<l n="tr">the father in law from his own son in law;</l>
<l n="tr">even brothers seldom could abide in peace.</l>
<l n="tr">The husband threatened to destroy his wife,</l>
<l n="tr">and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed</l>
<l n="tr">the deadly henbane: eager sons inquired</l>
<l n="tr">their fathers, ages. Piety was slain:</l>
<l n="tr">and last of all the virgin deity,</l>
<l n="tr">Astraea vanished from the blood-stained earth.</l>

<milestone ed="More" n="GIANTS" unit="tale"/>
<l n="tr">And lest ethereal heights should long remain</l>
<l n="tr">less troubled than the earth, the throne of Heaven</l>
<l n="tr">was threatened by the Giants;   and they piled</l>
<l n="tr">mountain on mountain to the lofty stars.</l>
<l n="tr">But Jove, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts</l>
<l n="tr">through <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Mount Olympus</placeName>, and he overturned</l>
<l n="tr">from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion.</l>
<l n="tr">And while these dreadful bodies lay overwhelmed</l>
<l n="tr">in their tremendous bulk, (so fame reports)</l>
<l n="tr">the Earth was reeking with the copious blood</l>
<l n="tr">of her gigantic sons; and thus replete</l>
<l n="tr">with moisture she infused the steaming gore</l>
<l n="tr">with life renewed. So that a monument</l>
<l n="tr">of such ferocious stock should be retained,</l>
<l n="tr">she made that offspring in the shape of man;  </l>
<l n="tr">but this new race alike despised the Gods,</l>

<l n="tr">the &ldquo;Palace of High Heaven.&rdquo; When the Gods</l>

<l n="tr">the King of all above the throng sat high,</l>
<l n="tr">and leaning on his ivory scepter, thrice,</l>
<l n="tr">and once again he shook his awful locks,</l>
<l n="tr">wherewith he moved the earth, and seas and stars,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and thus indignantly began to speak;</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;The time when serpent footed giants strove</l>
<l n="tr">to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">not more than this event could cause alarm</l>
<l n="tr">for my dominion of the universe.</l>
<l n="tr">Although it was a savage enemy,</l>
<l n="tr">yet warred we with a single source derived</l>
<l n="tr">of one. Now must I utterly destroy</l>
<l n="tr">this mortal race wherever Nereus roars</l>
<l n="tr">around the world. Yea, by the Infernal Streams</l>
<l n="tr">that glide through Stygian groves beneath the world,</l>
<l n="tr">I swear it. Every method has been tried.</l>
<l n="tr">The knife must cut immedicable wounds,</l>
<l n="tr">lest maladies infect untainted parts.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Beneath my sway are demi gods and fauns,</l>
<l n="tr">nymphs, rustic deities, sylvans of the hills,</l>
<l n="tr">satyrs;&mdash;all these, unworthy Heaven's abodes,</l>
<l n="tr">we should at least permit to dwell on earth</l>
<l n="tr">which we to them bequeathed. What think ye, Gods,</l>

<l n="tr">by fierce Lycaon?&rdquo; Ardent in their wrath,</l>
<l n="tr">the astonished Gods demand revenge overtake</l>
<l n="tr">this miscreant; he who dared commit such crimes.</l>
<l n="tr">'Twas even thus when raged that impious band</l>
<l n="tr">to blot the Roman name in sacred blood</l>
<l n="tr">of Caesar, sudden apprehensive fears</l>
<l n="tr">of ruin absolute astonished man,</l>
<l n="tr">and all the world convulsed. Nor is the love</l>

<l n="tr">and as indignant clamour ceased, suppressed</l>
<l n="tr">by regnant majesty, Jove once again</l>
<l n="tr">broke the deep silence with imperial words;</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Dismiss your cares; he paid the penalty</l>
<l n="tr">however all the crime and punishment</l>
<l n="tr">now learn from this:&mdash;An infamous report</l>
<l n="tr">of this unholy age had reached my ears,</l>
<l n="tr">and wishing it were false, I sloped my course</l>
<l n="tr">from high <placeName key="tgn,2109778">Olympus</placeName>, and&mdash;although a God&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">disguised in human form I viewed the world.</l>
<l n="tr">It would delay us to recount the crimes</l>
<l n="tr">unnumbered, for reports were less than truth.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;I traversed Maenalus where fearful dens</l>

<l n="tr">of pine tree groves, across Cyllene steep;</l>
<l n="tr">and as the twilight warned of night's approach,</l>
<l n="tr">I stopped in that <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName> tyrant's realms</l>
<l n="tr">and entered his inhospitable home:&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and when I showed his people that a God</l>

<l n="tr">and he prepared to slay me in the night,&mdash;</l>

<l n="tr">So made he merry with his impious proof;</l>

<l n="tr">His vesture separates in shaggy hair,</l>

<l n="tr">nor injured by this sacred freight:&rsquo; and I</l>
<l n="tr">opposed them as they came.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Then Lycabas,</l>
<l n="tr">the most audacious of that impious crew,</l>
<l n="tr">began to rage. He was a criminal,</l>
<l n="tr">who, for a dreadful murder, had been sent</l>
<l n="tr">in exile from a Tuscan city's gates.</l>
<l n="tr">Whilst I opposed he gripped me by the throat,</l>
<l n="tr">and shook me as would cast me in the deep,</l>
<l n="tr">had I not firmly held a rope, half stunned:</l>
<l n="tr">and all that wicked crew approved the deed.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Then Bacchus (be assured it was the God)</l>
<l n="tr">as though the noise disturbed his lethargy</l>
<l n="tr">from wine, and reason had regained its power,</l>
<l n="tr">at last bespake the men, &lsquo;What deeds are these?</l>
<l n="tr">What noise assails my ears? What means decoyed</l>
<l n="tr">my wandering footsteps? Whither do ye lead?&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;Fear not,&rsquo; the steersman said, &lsquo;but tell us fair</l>
<l n="tr">the haven of your hope, and you shall land</l>
<l n="tr">whereso your heart desires.&rsquo; &lsquo;To <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> steer,&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Quoth Bacchus, &lsquo;for it is indeed my home,</l>
<l n="tr">and there the mariner finds welcome cheer.&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Him to deceive, they pledged themselves, and swore</l>
<l n="tr">by Gods of seas and skies to do his will:</l>
<l n="tr">and they commanded me to steer that way.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;The Isle of <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> was upon our right;</l>
<l n="tr">and when they saw the sails were set that way,</l>
<l n="tr">they all began to shout at once, &lsquo;What, ho!</l>
<l n="tr">Thou madman! what insanity is this,</l>
<l n="tr">Acoetes? Make our passage to the left.&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">And all the while they made their meaning known</l>
<l n="tr">by artful signs or whispers in my ears.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;I was amazed and answered, &lsquo;Take the helm.&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">And I refused to execute their will,</l>
<l n="tr">atrocious, and at once resigned command.</l>
<l n="tr">Then all began to murmur, and the crew</l>
<l n="tr">reviled me. Up Aethalion jumped and said,</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;As if our only safety is in you!&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">With this he swaggered up and took command;</l>
<l n="tr">and leaving <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName> steered for other shores.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Then Bacchus, mocking them,&mdash;as if but then</l>
<l n="tr">he had discovered their deceitful ways,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">looked on the ocean from the rounded stern,</l>
<l n="tr">and seemed to sob as he addressed the men;</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;Ah mariners, what alien shores are these?</l>
<l n="tr">'Tis not the land you promised nor the port</l>
<l n="tr">my heart desires. For what have I deserved</l>
<l n="tr">this cruel wrong? What honour can accrue</l>
<l n="tr">if strong men mock a boy; a lonely youth</l>
<l n="tr">if many should deceive?&rsquo; And as he spoke,</l>
<l n="tr">I, also, wept to see their wickedness.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;The impious gang made merry at our tears,</l>
<l n="tr">and lashed the billows with their quickening oars.</l>
<l n="tr">By Bacchus do I swear to you (and naught</l>
<l n="tr">celestial is more potent) all the things</l>
<l n="tr">I tell you are as true as they surpass</l>
<l n="tr">the limit of belief. The ship stood still</l>
<l n="tr">as if a dry dock held it in the sea.&mdash;</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;The wondering sailors laboured at the oars,</l>
<l n="tr">and they unfurled the sails, in hopes to gain</l>
<l n="tr">some headway, with redoubled energies;</l>
<l n="tr">but twisting ivy tangled in the oars,</l>
<l n="tr">and interlacing held them by its weight.</l>
<l n="tr">And Bacchus in the midst of all stood crowned</l>
<l n="tr">with chaplets of grape-leaves, and shook a lance</l>
<l n="tr">covered with twisted fronds of leafy vines.</l>
<l n="tr">Around him crouched the visionary forms</l>
<l n="tr">of tigers, lynxes, and the mottled shapes</l>
<l n="tr">of panthers.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Then the mariners leaped out,</l>
<l n="tr">possessed by fear or madness. Medon first</l>
<l n="tr">began to turn a swarthy hue, and fins</l>
<l n="tr">grew outward from his flattened trunk,</l>
<l n="tr">and with a curving spine his body bent.&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">then Lycabas to him, &lsquo;What prodigy</l>
<l n="tr">is this that I behold?&rsquo; Even as he spoke,</l>
<l n="tr">his jaws were broadened and his nose was bent;</l>
<l n="tr">his hardened skin was covered with bright scales.</l>
<l n="tr">And Libys, as he tried to pull the oars,</l>
<l n="tr">could see his own hands shrivel into fins;</l>
<l n="tr">another of the crew began to grasp</l>
<l n="tr">the twisted ropes, but even as he strove</l>
<l n="tr">to lift his arms they fastened to his sides;&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">with bending body and a crooked back</l>
<l n="tr">he plunged into the waves, and as he swam</l>
<l n="tr">displayed a tail, as crescent as the moon.</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Now here, now there, they flounce about the ship;</l>
<l n="tr">they spray her decks with brine; they rise and sink;</l>
<l n="tr">they rise again, and dive beneath the waves;</l>
<l n="tr">they seem in sportive dance upon the main;</l>
<l n="tr">out from their nostrils they spout sprays of brine;</l>
<l n="tr">they toss their supple sides. And I alone,</l>
<l n="tr">of twenty mariners that manned that ship,</l>
<l n="tr">remained. A cold chill seized my limbs,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">I was so frightened; but the gracious God</l>
<l n="tr">now spake me fair, &lsquo;Fear not and steer for <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName>.&rsquo;</l>
