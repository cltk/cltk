<head>THE SUBJECT</head>

<p>EUCLIO, a miserly old Athenian, has a daughter named Ph&aelig;dra, who has been ravished by a young man named Lyconides, but is ignorant from whom she has received that injury. Lyconides has an uncle named Megadorus, who being ignorant of these circumstances, determines to ask Ph&aelig;dra of her father, in marriage for himself. Euclio has discovered a pot of gold in his house which he watches with the greatest anxiety. In the meantime, Megadorus asks his daughter in marriage, and his proposal is accepted; and while preparations are making for the nuptials, Euclio conceals his treasure, first in on place and then in another. Strobilus, the servant of Lyconides, watches his movements, and, having discovered it, carries off the treasure. While Euclio is lamenting his loss, Lyconides accosts him, with the view of confessing the outrage he has committed on his daughter, and of announcing to him that his uncle, Megadorus, has cancelled his agreement to marry her, in favour of himself. Euclio at first thinks that he is come to confess the robbery of the treasure. After much parleying, his mistake is rectified, and the matter is explained; on which Lyconides forces Strobilus to confess the theft; and (although the rest of the Play In its original form is lost) we learn from the acrostic Argument that Strobilus gives up the treasure, and Lyconides marries the daughter of Euclio, and receives the gold for a marriage-portion. The Supplement written by Codrus Urcens to supply the place of what is lost has been added.

<head>THE PROLOGUE<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Title <foreign lang="la">Aulularia</foreign></lemma>:  This word is derived from the old Latin word "aula," the same with the more recent form "olla," signifying "a pot," and whose diminutive was "aulula," which had the same signification. It will be seen how conspicuous a part the "aula" performs in the Play. Warner says, in a Note to his Translation, that Moli&egrave;re took a great part of his Comedy, called L'Avare, from this play of Plautus; and that there are two English Comedies on the same plan, one by Shadwell, the other by Fielding, called the Miser.</note></head>

<sp><speaker>THE HOUSEHOLD GOD</speaker><p>Lest any one should wonder who I am, I will tell you in a few words. I am the household God of this family, from whose house you have seen me coming forth. It is now many years that I have been occupying this houses and I inhabited it for the father and the grandfather of this person who now dwells here. But beseeching me, his grandfather entrusted to me a treasure of gold, unknown to all. He deposited it in the midst of the hearth<milestone n="7" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Midst of the hearth</lemma>:  The Lares, or household Gods, were kept in the "<foreign lang="la">lararium</foreign>," which was a recess near the "focus," or "hearth," and in which prayers were offered up by the Romans on rising in the morning. The hearth of fireplace was in the middle of the house, and was sacred to the Lares</note>, praying me that I would watch it for him. He, when he died, was of such an avaricious disposition, that he would never disclose it to his own son, and preferred rather to leave him in want than to show that treasure to that son. He left him no large quantity of land, on which to live with great laboriousness and in wretchedness. When he died who had entrusted that gold to me, I began to take notice whether his son would any how pay greater honor to me than his father had paid me. But he was in the habit of venerating me still less and less by very much, and gave me a still less share of devotion. So in return was it done by me; and he likewise ended his life. He left this person who now dwells here, his son, of the same disposition as his father and grandfather were. He has an only daughter; she is always every day making offerings to me, either with incense, or wine, or something or other; she presents me, too, with chaplets. Out of regard for her, I have caused this Euclio to find this treasure, in order that he might more readily give her in marriage if he should wish; for a young man of very high rank has ravished her; this young man knows who it is that he has ravished; she knows him not, nor yet does her father know that she has been ravished. This day I shall cause the old gentleman here, our neighbour, to ask her as his wife; that will I do for this reason, that he may the more easily marry her who has ravished her. And this old gentleman who shall ask her as his wife, the same is the uncle of that young man who debauched her in the night time at the festival of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName><milestone n="36" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Festival of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName></lemma>:  He probably alludes to the Thesmophoria, a festival which was celebrated in honor of the Goddess <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>, and a large portion of the rites whereof were solemnized in the night time. In general it was celebrated only by the married women, though, as we find in the present instance, the maidens took some part in a portion of the ceremonial. It was said to have been celebrated in the night time in commemoration of the search by Ceres, with a torch in her hand, for her daughter Proserpine, when ravished by Pluto. No lights were used on the occasion, which will account, in a great measure, for the mishap of Ph&aelig;dra in the present instance, without her knowing who was the party that had insulted her. See an able article on the Thesmophoria in Dr Simth's Dictionary of Antiquities.</note>. But this old fellow is now making an uproar in the house, as usual; he is thrusting the old woman out of doors, that she may not be privy to the secret. I suppose he wants to look at the gold, if it be not stolen.

Each "curia" had its place for meeting and worship, which was also called "curia;" and was presided over by the "Curio," who is here called the "Magister curi&aelig;," or "master of the ward." At first the Patricians and Equites had the sole influence in the "curi&aelig;," and alone electee the "Curiones;" but after the year <date value="-209">A.U.C. 544</date>, the "Curio" was elected from the Patricians, after which period the political importance of the "curi&aelig;" gradually declined, until they became mere bodies meeting for the performance of religious observances. Plautus probably alludes, in the present instance, to a dole, or distribution of money, made by the Greek Trittuarch among the poorer brethren of his <foreign lang="greek">trittu\v,</foreign> or "tribus;" as in adapting a Greek play to the taste of a Roman audience, he very often mingles the customs of the one country with those of the other.</note> has given notice that he will distribute a didrachm of silver to each man; if I relinquish that, and don't ask for it, at once I fancy that all will be suspecting that I've got gold at home; for it isn't very likely that a poor man would despise ever such a trifle, so as not to ask for his piece of money.

<sp><speaker>EUNOMIA</speaker><p> I could wish you, brother, to think that I utter these words by reason of my own regard and your welfare, as is befitting your own sister to do. Although I'm not unaware that we women are accounted troublesome; for we are all of us deservedly considered very talkative, and, in fact, they say at the present day that not a single woman has been found dumb<milestone n="125" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Has been found dumb</lemma>:  Not seeing the sarcasm intended against the female sex in this passage, Lambinus seriously takes the trouble to contradict Eunomia; his words are, "I myself, who am at present in my fifty-sixth year have seen no less than two dumb women."</note> in any age. Still, brother, do you consider this one circumstance, that I am your nearest relation, and you in like manner are mine. How proper it is that I should counsel and advise you, and you me, as to what we may judge for the interest of each of us; and for it not to be kept concealed or kept silence upon through apprehension, but rather that I should make you my confidant, and you me in like manner. For that reason, now, have I brought you here apart out of doors, that I might here discourse with you upon your private concerns.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter EUCLIO.</stage>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. My mind had a presentiment that I was going to no purpose when I left my house; and therefore I went unwillingly; for neither did any one of the wardsmen come, nor yet the master of the ward, who ought to have distributed the money. Now I'm making all haste to hasten home; for I myself am here, my mind's at home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> <stage>accosting him</stage>. May you be well, and ever fortunate, Euclio!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> May the Gods bless you, Megadorus!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. It isn't for nothing when a rich man accosts a poor man courteously; now this fellow knows that I've got some gold; for that reason he salutes me more courteously.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Do you say that you are well?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. By my faith, the old woman has made a discovery to him about the gold; 'tis clear it's all out. I'll cut off her tongue, and tear out her eyes, when I get home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Why are you talking to yourself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> I'm lamenting my poverty; I've a grown-up girl without a portion, and one that can't be disposed of in marriage; nor have I the ability to marry her to anybody.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Hold your peace; be of good courage, Euclio: she shall be given in marriaye; you shall be assisted by myself. Say, if you have need of aught; command me.</p></sp>

The expression is used in the New Testament. "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?" St. Luke, c. xi., v. 11.

<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> By my troth, I do believe that when I make mention of his daughter, for him to promise her to me, he'll suppose that he's being laughed at by me; nor is there out of the whole class of paupers one more beggarly than he. <stage>EUCLIO returns from his house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. The Gods do favour me; my property's all safe. If nothing's lost, it's safe. I was very dreadfully afraid, before I went in-doors!

<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> I know that they are plentiful, just like your money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> I' faith, for sure I really did always take you to be a citizen without any evil guile, and now I think you so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. He smells the gold. <stage>Aloud.</stage> What do you want with me now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Since you know me, and I know you, what sort of person you are--a thing, that may it bring a blessing on myself, and you and your daughter, I ask your daughter as my wife. Promise me that it shall be so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Heyday! Megadorus, you are doing a deed that's not becoming to your usual actions, in laughing at me, a poor man, and guiltless towards yourself and towards your family For neither in act, nor in words, have I ever deserved it of you, that you should do what you are now doing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> By my troth, I neither am come to laugh at you, nor am I laughing at you, nor do I think you deserving of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Why then do you ask for my daughter for your self?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> That through me it may be better for you, and through you and yours for me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> This suggests itself to my mind, Megadorus, that you are a wealthy man, a man of rank; that I likewise am a person, the poorest of the poor; now, if I should give my daughter in marriage to you, it suggests itself to my mind that you are the ox, and that I am the ass; when I'm yoked to you, and when I'm not able to bear the burden equally with yourself, I, the ass, must lie down in the mire; you, the ox, would regard me no more than if I had never been born; and I should both find you unjust, and my own class would laugh at me; in neither direction should I have a fixed stall, if there should be any separation<milestone n="233" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Be any separation</lemma>:  "Si quid divortii fuat." By the use of the word "divortium," he means either an estrangement of himself from Megadorus, or a separation or divorce of the latter from his intended wife, which of course would lead to the same consequences. The facilities for divorce among the Romans have been remarked upon in a previous Note.</note>; the asses would tear me with their teeth, the oxen would butt at me with their horns. This is the great hazard, in my passing over from the asses to the oxen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> The nearer you can unite yourself in alliance with the virtuous, so much the better. Do you receive this proposal, listen to me, and promise her to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> But indeed there is no marriage-portion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> You are to give none; so long as she comes with good principles, she is sufficiently portioned.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> I say so for this reason, that you mayn't be supposing that I have found any treasures.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> I know that; don't enlarge upon it. Promise her to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> So be it. <stage>Starts and looks about.</stage> But, O <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>, am I not utterly undone?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> What's the matter with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> What was it sounded just now as though it were iron?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Here at my place, I ordered them to dig up the garden. <stage>EUCLIO runs off into his house.</stage> But where is this man? He's off, and he hasn't fully answered me; he treats me with contempt. Because he sees that I wish for his friendship, he acts after the manner of mankind. For if a wealthy person goes to ask a favour of a poorer one, the poor man is afraid to treat with him; through his apprehension he hurts his own interest. The same person, when this opportunity is lost, too late, then wishes for it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>coming out of the house, addressing STAPHYLA within</stage>. By the powers, if I don't give you up to have your tongue cut out by the roots, I order and I authorize you to hand me over to any one you please to be incapacitated.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> By my troth, Euclio, I perceive that you consider me a fit man for you to make sport of in my old age, for no deserts of my own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> I' faith, Megadorus, I am not doing so, nor, should I desire it, had I the means<milestone n="254" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Had I the means</lemma>:  "Neque, si cupiam, copia est." In saying this, Euclio intends to play upon the words of Megadorus, "ludos facias," which may either signify "you make sport of me," or "you give a public show" or "spectacle," which the wealthy Patricians of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> were in the habit of doing. Euclio pretends to take his words in the latter sense, and replies, "I couldn't even if I would," by reason of his poverty, as he pretends. It was usual for the &AElig;diles to provide the spectacles from their private resources, from which circumstance one who lived a life of extravagance was said "&AElig;dilitatem petere," "to be aspiring to the &AElig;dileship."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> How now? Do you then betroth your daughter to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> On those terms, and with that portion which I mentioned to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Do you promise her then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> I do promise her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> May the Gods bestow their blessings on it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> May the Gods so do. Take you care of this, and remember that we've agreed, that my daughter is not to bring you any portion.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> I remember it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> But I understand in what fashion you, of your class, are wont to equivocate; an agreement is no agreement, no agreement is an agreement, just as it pleases you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> I'll have no misunderstanding with you. But what reason is there why we shouldn't have the nuptials this day?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Why, by my troth, there is very good reason for them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> I'll go, then, and prepare matters. Do you want me in any way?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> That shall be done. Fare you well.</p></sp>

From the remark made in l. 265, we find that Congrio and Anthrax are slaves.</note> and these music- girls in the market-place, he ordered me to divide these provisions into two parts.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> By my troth, but you really shan't be dividing me<milestone n="283" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You really shan't be dividing me</lemma>:  He alludes to his own name, "Congrio," "a conger eel," which was cut up before it was cooked; and he means to say, that spite of his name, he will not stand being divided by Strobilus.</note>, I tell you plainly. If you wish me to go anywhere whole, I'll do my best.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHRAX </speaker><p> A very pretty and modest fellow, indeed<milestone n="285" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Modest fellow, indeed</lemma>:  Anthrax gives a very indelicate turn to the remark of Congrio; and the liberty has been taken of giving a more harmless form to the gross witticism of Anthrax. It may be here remarked, that he takes his name from the Greek word, signifying "a coal," a commodity, of course much in request with cooks.</note>. As if, when you are a conger by name, you wouldn't like to be cut into pieces.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> But, Anthrax, I said that in another sense, and not in the one which you are pretending.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTHRAX </speaker><p> Whose daughter is he to marry? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTHRAX </speaker><p> That is, you take one half to him, the other half home?
</p></sp>

Although <placeName key="tgn,2093704">Thornton</placeName> thinks that the suggestion of Lambinus that "follem obstringit" means, "he ties up the nozzle of the bellows," is forced and far-fetched, it is far from improbable that that is the meaning of the passage.

<sp><speaker>ANTHRAX </speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>

There were eight Pr&aelig;tors in the time of <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>. Two of them were employed in adjudicating "in causis privatis," "disputes concerning private property." One of these was called "Pr&aelig;tor urbanus," or "the city Pr&aelig;tor," who administered justice when the parties were "cives," or possessed the rights of Roman citizenship. The other was called "Pr&aelig;tor peregrinus," or "the foreigners' Pr&aelig;tor," who administered justice when both the litigating parties, or only one of them, were "peregrini," or "foreigners," and had not the right of Roman citizenship. The other six Pr&aelig;tors had jurisdiction in criminal cases, such as murder, adultery, and violence. The Pr&aelig;tors committed the examination of causes to subordinate judges, who were called "judices selecti," and they published the sentences of the judges so appointed by them. The Pr&aelig;tors wore the "toga pr&aelig;texta," or "magisterial robe," sat on the "sella curulis," and were preceded by six lictors. Their duties lasted for a year, after which they went as governors to such provinces as had no army, which were assigned to them by lot. There they administered justice in the same way as they had done as Pr&aelig;tors at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and were called by the name of "Propr&aelig;tores;" though, as such governors, they were also sometimes called "Pr&aelig;tores." The office of Pr&aelig;tor was first instituted at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> <date value="-365">A.U.C. 388</date>, partly because the Consuls, on account of the many wars in which the Romans were engaged, could no longer administer justice; partly that the Patricians might thereby have a compensation for admitting the Plebeians to a share in the Consulate. At first there was only one Pr&aelig;tor; Sylla made their number six; Julius C&aelig;sar eight; and Augustus increased them to sixteen. It will not escape observation, that Plautus, as usual, mentions a Roman officer in a Play, the scene of which is supposed to be <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>.</note>; there, weeping and lamenting, he began to request that he might be allowed to compel the kite to give bail.

<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> He's a nine-day cook<milestone n="324" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A nine-day cook</lemma>:  Congrio probably means to say that Anthrax is a cook who only gets employment on the "Nundin&aelig;," when the influx of country-people into the city called the services of even the worst cooks into requisition, and the eaters were not of the most fastidious description. The "Nundin&aelig;" (so called from "non&aelig;," "ninth," and "dies," "day") returned every eighth day, according to our mode of reckoning; but according to the Romans, who, in counting, reckoned both extreme, every ninth day, whence the name. On this day the country-people came into the city to sell their wares, make their purchases, hear the new laws read, and learn the news. By the Hortensian law, the "Nundin&aelig;," which before were only "feri&aelig;," or "holidays," were made "fasti," or "court-days," that the country-people then in town might have their lawsuits determined. Lipsius thinks that reference is here made to the feast called "novendiale," which was sometimes given to the poorer classes on the ninth day after the funeral of a person of affluence. Probably, the cooking of these banquets was not of the highest order; but the former seems the more probable explanation of the passage.</note>; every ninth day he's in the habit of going out to cook.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter MEGADORUS, at a distance.</stage>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. I've communicated to many friends my design about this proposal; they speak in high terms of the daughter of Euclio. They say that it was discreetly done, and with great prudence. But, in my opinion, indeed, if the other richer men were to do the same, so as to take home as their wives, without dower, the daughters of the poorer persons, both the state would become much more united, and we should meet with less ill feeling than we now meet with; both, they, the wives, would stand in fear of punishment more than they do stand in fear of it, and we husbands should be at less expense than we now are. In the greater part of the people this is a most just way of thinking; in the smaller portion there is an objection among the avaricious, whose avaricious minds and insatiate dispositions there is neither law nor magistrate to be able to put a check upon. But a person may say this; "How are these rich women with portions to marry, if this law is laid down for the poor?" Let them marry whom they please, so long as the dowry isn't their companion. If this were so done, the women would acquire for themselves better manners for them to bring, in place of dowry, than they now bring. I'd make mules, which exceed horses in price, to become cheaper than Gallic geldings<milestone n="495" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Than Gallic geldings</lemma>:  Mules were much coveted by the haughty names of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> for the purpose of drawing their carriages.

Powders were also used as perfumes; they were called "diapasmata."

On this, Megadorus, who has not heard, or else has misunderstood, the last syllable for "nem," instead of "sam," asks him what sort of a lamb a "curio" (the nominative of "curionem")  lamb is; on which Euclio catches him up, and says he calls a "curio" lamb such a one as he has sent him, all skin and bone, and lean with "cura," "care." "Curionem" is by many preferred as the reading in the 517th line to "curiosam," and perhaps it is the best. Be it as it may, the wit seems far-fetched; and not improbably the word "curio" may have had some meaning which is now lost, other than its usual signification of the master or head of a "curia," or "ward."</note> beast existing.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter STROBILUS <note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Strobilus</lemma>:  It is a curious fact that all of the editions make this to be a different person from the Strobilus, the servant of Megadorus, whom we have already seen hiring Congrio, Anthrax, and the "tibicin&aelig;." In the "dramatis person&aelig;" they style this one, Strobilus, "the servant of Lyconides," and the other Strobilus, in some instances, as "the servant of Megadorus," and in others (evidently by mistake) as "the servant of Euclio." On examination we shall find there is no ground for this. Eunomia (most probably a widow) is living, together with her son Lyconides, in the house of her brother Megadorus. This is clear from what Lyconides says in l. 684, where, speaking of the house of his uncle, he calls it "&aelig;des nostras," "our house," which he would not have said had he not been residing there. By the indulgence of his uncle, who has no children, we may presume that Strobilus has been permitted to consider him as "his young master." After hiring the cooks, he has communicated the bad news to Lyconides, who tells him to keep a good look-out, and inform him of any chance that may possibly happen for breaking off the marriage.</note>.</stage>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> This is the duty of a good servant, to do what I'm intending, not to consider the commands of his master a bore or trouble to him. For that servant who resolves to serve his master with hearty goodwill, him it behoves to act expeditiously for his master, slowly for himself; but if he sleeps, let him so sleep as to bethink himself that he is a servant. But he who lives in servitude to one in love, as I am serving, if he sees love overcoming his master, this I think to be the duty of the servant; to restrain him for his safety, not to impel him onwards towards his own inclination. Just as a float of bulrushes is placed beneath boys who are learning to swim, by means of which they may labour less, so as to swim more easily and move their hands; in the same way do I consider that it is proper for the servant to be a buoy to his master thus in love, so as to bear him up lest he should go to the bottom; and so * * * * should he learn the will of his master, that his eyes should know what his mouth chooses not to speak. What he orders, he should hasten to perform more swiftly than the swift steeds. He who shall have a care for these things, will escape the castigation of the ox's hide, nor by his own means will he ever bring the fetters to brightness. Now, my master's in love with the daughter of this poor man, Euclio; word has just now been brought to my master that she is given to Megadorus here: he has sent me here to spy out, that he may be made acquainted with the things that are going on.

The humour of the whole scene turns upon Euclio and Lyconides mistaking the meaning of each other--the former thinking that the latter is speaking about the "aula," or "pot," while the latter fancies that Euclio is amenting the mishap of his daughter. In the Latin language, the word "aula" is or the feminine gender, by reason of which the misunderstanding is much more natural than it would be in the English language. In consequence, some little latitude in the translation is absolutely necessary to sustain the equivoque of the original</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> How? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I confess that I have done wrong, and I know that I deserve censure; for that reason I'm come to beseech you, that, with feelings assuaged, you will pardon me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Why did you dare do so, to touch that which was not your own?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> What do you wish to be done? The thing has been done; it can't be undone. I believe that the Gods willed it, for if they hadn't willed it, I know it wouldn't have happened.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> But I believe that the Gods have willed that I should be the death of you in fetters.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Don't say that! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> What business then have you to touch what is my own against my will?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Because I did it under the evil influence of wine and love.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Most audacious man, that you should dare to come here to me with that speech, you impudent fellow! For if this is lawful, so that you may be able to excuse it--let us openly, in broad daylight, plunder their golden trinkets from ladies--after that, if we are caught, let us excuse ourselves, that we did it when intoxicated, by reason of being in love. Too cheap are wine and love, if one in liquor and in love is allowed to do with impunity whatever he pleases.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> But I come to you of my own accord to supplicate you on account of my folly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Persons don't please me, who, when they've done wrong, excuse themselves.

<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Therefore, inasmuch as I did dare to touch, I make no objection to keep by all means.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> By my faith, I've neither said so, nor have I done it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Do you deny it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Yes, I do utterly deny it; for neither the gold nor yet this pot, what it means, do I know or understand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Give me up that pot which you took away from the wood of Sylvanus. Come, give it me back! I would rather give you the one-half of it. Although you are a thief to me, I'll not be hard upon the thief. Give it me back.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> You are not in your senses, to call me a thief; I thought, Euclio, that you had come to the knowledge of another matter; as concerns myself, it is a great matter which I wish to speak with you upon at your leisure, if you are at leisure.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> In good faith, No, to that as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> But if you should know who has taken it away, will you discover it to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I will do so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Nor accept of a share from him, whoever he is, for yourself, nor harbour the thief?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> You can't make good your pretences. Come, give up the gold!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> I, give up the gold? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Even kill me outright, i' faith, you never shall get it hence of me <gap/><note anchored="yes">The rest of this Play is unfortunately lost. From the Acrostic Argument which is prefixed to the Play, we learn that Lyconides obtained the gold, and gave it up to Euclio, who presented it to him as a marriage-portion with his daughter. In some of the Editions there is a Supplement to the last Scene, written in a very meagre style by some unknown author, which is not worth presenting to the reader The Supplementby Antonius Codrus Urceus, a learned scholar and professor at <placeName key="tgn,7004847">Bologna</placeName>, is certainly somewhat superior, and, such as it is, a translation of it is here presented to the reader. Its chief fault is, that it indicates a greater change in the nature of the miser than is consistent with probability. Though Plautus doubtless depicted him as giving up the gold to his new son-in-law, it was probably on some other ground than a change of disposition.</note>

<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> ---- the pot belonging to the old fellow, which I've not got.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I will have it, whether you will or no; when I've tied you up all fours, and torn asunder your body for you tied up to the beam. But why do I delay to rush upon the jaws of this rascal, and why this instant do I not compel his soul to take its journey before its time<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Before its time</lemma>: --The expression used here by Urceus is capable of two modes of translation; the most delicate one has been preferred.</note>? Are you going to give it me or not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> I will give it you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I want you to give it me now, and not at a future time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> I'll give it now; but I entreat you to allow me to recover breath. <stage>LYCONIDES lets him go.</stage> Aha! What is it you want me to give you, master?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Don't you know, you rascal? And do you dare to refuse me the four pound pot full of gold which you just now said you had stolen? <stage>Calling at the door.</stage> Hallo there! Where now are the flogging men?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Master, do hear a few words. Lyc. I won't hear; floggers, hallo there--hallo!
</p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="scene" n="2">
<milestone n="1" unit="line"/><milestone n="832b" unit="TLN line"/>
<stage>Enter two FLOGGING SLAVES.</stage>
<sp><speaker>SLAVE.</speaker><p> What's the matter? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I want the chains to be got ready.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Listen to me, I beg of you; afterwards order them to bind me as much as you please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I will hear you; but hasten the matter very quickly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> If you order me to be tortured to death, see what you obtain; in the first place, you have the death of your slave. Then, what you wish for you cannot get. But if you had only allured me by the reward of dear liberty, you would already have obtained your wish. Nature produces all men free, and by nature all desire freedom. Slavery is worse than every evil, than every calamity; and he whom <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> hates, him he first makes a slave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> You speak not unwisely </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Now then hear the rest. Our age has produced masters too grasping, whom I'm in the habit of calling Harpagos, Harpies, and Tantali, poor amid great wealth, and thirsty in the midst of the waters of Ocean; no riches are enough for them, not those of Midas, not of Cr&oelig;sus; not all the wealth of the Persians can satisfy their Tartarean maw. Masters use their slaves rigorously, and slaves now obey their masters but tardily; so on neither side is that done which would be fair to be done. Their provisions, kitchens, and store-cellars, avaricious old fellows shut up with a thousand keys. Slaves, thievish, doubledealers, and artful, open for themselves things shut up with a thousand keys, which the owners hardly like to be granted to their lawful children, and stealthily do they carry off, consume, and lick them up--fellows that will never disclose their hundred thefts even at the gibbet; thus in laughter and joking do bad slaves take revenge upon their slavery. So then, I come to the conclusion that liberality renders slaves faithful.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Rightly, indeed, have you spoken, but not in a few words, as you promised me. But if I do make you free, will you give me back what I'm asking for?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> I will give it back; but I wish for witnesses to be present; you'll pardon me, master, I trust you but little.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Just as you please; let there be present even a hundred; then I shouldn't care about it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> <stage>going to the door of the house of MEGADORUS</stage>. Megadorus, and you, Eunomia, please come here, I beg of you; the business finished, you shall return directly.

<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Who's calling us? Ha! Lyconides! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUNOMIA</speaker><p> Ha! Strobilus, what is the matter? Say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> 'Tis a short matter. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> What is it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> I'm calling you as witnesses. If I bring here a four pound pot full of gold and give it up to Lyconides, Lyconides makes me a free man, and orders me to be my own master. <stage>To LYCONIDES.</stage> Do you not promise me so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I do promise so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Have you heard now what he has said?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> We have heard. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Swear, then, by <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Alas! to what I am reduced by the misfortunes of others! You are too insulting; still, I'll do what he bids me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Hark you, our generation hasn't much confidence in people: the documents are signed; the twelve witnesses are present; the registrar writes down the time and the place; and still, the pleader is found to deny that it has been done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYE.</speaker><p> But release me speedily, please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> Here, take this stone. <stage>Giving him a stone.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> If I knowingly deceive you, so may <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> reject from me his blessings, the city and citadel safe, as I do this stone. <stage>(He throws it.</stage> Have I now satisfied you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> I am satisfied; and I'm going to bring the gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Go with the speed of Pegasus, and return devouring the road with your rapid steps. <stage>Exit STROBILUS.</stage> Any impertinent slave, that wishes to be more wise than his master, is a nuisance to a decent man. Let this Strobilus be off as a free man to utter perdition, if he only brings me the pot full of pure gold, so that I may restore Euclio, my father-in-law, from his grief to joy, and obtain the favour of his daughter, who is just brought to bed by reason of my debauching her. But see! Strobilus is returning, loaded; as I guess, he's bringing the pot; and, for sure, it is the pot that he's carrying.

<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> <stage>going to the door of EUCLIO'S house</stage>. Ho, Eucho, Euclio!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MEGADORUS</speaker><p> Euclio, Euclio! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>opening his window</stage>. What' the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> Come down to us, for the Gods will you to be saved; we've got the pot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> Have you got it, or are you trifling with me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> We've got it, I say. Now, if you can, fly down hither.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> <stage>having come out of the house to them</stage>. O great <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>! O household Divinity and Queen Juno! and Alcides, my treasurer! that at length you do show pity upon a wretched old man. <stage>Taking the pot in his arms.</stage> O my pot! O how aged I, your friend, do clasp you with joyful arms, and receive you with kisses; with a thousand embraces even I cannot be satisfied. O my hope! my heart! that dissipates my grief.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to MEGADORUS</stage>. I always thought that to be in want of gold was the worst thing for both boys and men, and all old people. Indigence compels boys to be guilty of misdeeds, men to thieve, and old men themselves to become beggars. But 'tis much worse, as I now see, to abound in gold beyond what's necessary for us. Alas! what miseries has Euclio endured on account of the pot, that a little while since was lost by him!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> To whom shall I give deserved thanks? Whether to the Gods, who show regard for good men, or to my friends, upright men, or to them both? Rather to both, I think; and first to you, Lyconides, the origin and author of so great a good; you do I present with this pot of gold; accept it with pleasure. I wish it to be your own, and my daughter as well, in the presence of Megadorus, and his good sister, Eunomia.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> <stage>receiving the pot of gold</stage>. The favour is received, and is returned, in thanks, as you deserve, Eucho, a father-in-law most acceptable to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EUCLIO</speaker><p> I shall think the favour sufficiently returned to me, if you now receive with pleasure my gift, and myself as well for your father-in-law.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> I do receive it; and I wish my house to be that of Euclio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> What still remains, master,--remember now that I'm to be free.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCONIDES</speaker><p> You've well put me in mind. Be you a free man, O Strobilus, for your deserts; and now prepare in-doors the dinner that has been so disturbed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STROBILUS</speaker><p> <stage>coming forward</stage>. Spectators, the avaricious Euclio has changed his nature; he has suddenly become liberal; so, too, do you practise liberality; and if the play has pleased you well, loudly clap your hands.
