<head>THE SUBJECT</head>
<p>CREON, King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, being at war with the Teleboans or Taphians, under the command of Ptereias, sends an army against them. This is commanded by Amphitryon, who leaves his wife Alcmena pregnant at his departure from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. During his absence from home, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, assuming his form, and Mercury that of his servant Sosia, present themselves to Alcmena, as though just returned from the expedition against the Taphians. By means of this stratagem, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> is admitted to the embraces of Alcmena. While Mercury is keeping watch at the door of Amphitryon's house, Sosia, who has just arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with Amphitryon, makes his appearance for the purpose of announcing to Alcmena his master's return. Mercury, pretending that he himself is the real Sosia, and that the other is an impostor, drives him away from the door. He goes back to his master, who returns with him to the house, and on meeting Alcmena, she denies his assertion that he has but that moment returned from the expedition, and now presents himself to her for the first time since his return. On this, Amphitryon charges her with infidelity, and goes away to the harbour to find a witness who may persuade Alcmena of the truth of his assertions. When he returns, he is first driven away from the house by Mercury, and is afterwards accused by <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> of attempting to personate Amphitryon, which person <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> asserts himself to be. The dispute is referred to Blepharo, the pilot of Amphitryon, who. after making minute enquiries into the matter, professes himself utterly unable to decide between them. In the Fifth Act, at the moment in which Alcmena is delivered of Hercules and Iphiclus, a violent. peal of thunder is heard, and Amphitryon swoons with the shock. Bromia, the attendant of Alcmena, comes out of the house, and having raised Amphitryon from the ground, on his recovery informs him of the delivery of Alcmena. At this juncture, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> descends in his own character, and reveals the mystery to Amphitryon, who then becomes reconciled with his wife.

<head>THE PROLOGUE.</head>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker> <p>As, in purchasing and selling your merchandize<milestone n="1" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Merck indize</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Mercimoniis</foreign>." Mercury was the God of trading and merchandize, and was said to have received his name from the Latin word "<foreign lang="la">merx</foreign>." See the tradesman's prayer to him in the Fasti of Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 5.685">B. v., l. 682</bibl>.</note>, you are desirous to render me propitious to your bargains, and that I should assist you in all things; and as both in foreign countries and at home, you desire me to turn to the best advantage the business and the accounts of you all, and that with fair and ample profit, without end, I should crown the venture both which you have begun, and which you shall begin; and as you wish me to delight you and all yours with joyous news<milestone n="8" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With joyous news</lemma>:  Mercury was the messenger of the Gods, and, therefore, the patron of messengers; and, if we may so say, the God of News.</note>--these tidings will I bring, that I may announce them to you, things which in especial are for your common interest (for already do you know, indeed, that it has been given and assigned to me by the other Divinities, to preside over news and profit): : as you would wish me to favour and promote these things, that lasting gain may ever be forthcoming for you, so shall you give silence for this play, and so shall you be fair and upright judges here, all of you.  Now, by whose command, and for what reason I am come, I'll tell you, and at the sane time, myself, I will disclose my name. By the command of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> I am come; my name is Mercury<milestone n="19" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">My name is Mercury</lemma>:  There seems hardly any reason why he should disclose his name, after having, by an enumeration of his attributes, informed the Audience who he is.</note>. My father has sent me hither to you to entreat, although, what should as his commands be enjoined on you, he knew that you would do, inasmuch as he knew full well that you venerate and fear himself, as is befitting <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>. But, certainly, he bade me ask this of you with entreaty, in gentle tones, and in bland accents. For, in fact, this <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, by whose command I am come, dreads a mishap<milestone n="27" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A mishap</lemma>:  "Malum." This word probably signifies here the corporal punishment which was inflicted on the slaves. It has been already remarked that the actors were mostly slaves, and punishment ensued on their displeasing the Audience.</note> not less than any one of you. Born of a mortal mother, a mortal sire, it is not reasonable to be surprised if he has apprehensions for himself. And I too, as well, who am the son of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, through my relationship to my father, stand in dread of ill. Therefore, in peace am I come to you, and peace do I bring. I wish a thing to be asked of you that's reasonable and feasible; for, reasonable things to ask of the reasonable, a reasonable mediator have I been sent. For from the reasonable it is not right to ask things unreasonable; whereas from the unreasonable to ask things reasonable, is sheer folly, since these unrighteous persons are ignorant of what is right, and observe it not. Now then, all lend your attention here to the things which I shall say. What we wish, you ought to wish as well: both I and my father have well deserved of you and of your state. But why should I mention how in Tragedies I have seen others, such as Neptune, Valour, Victory, Mars, Bellona, making mention of the good services which they had done you? Of all these benefits, the ruler of the Deities, my sire, was the founder. But this has never been the habit of my father, to throw in your teeth what good he has done unto the good. He thinks that this is gratefully returned by you to him, and that he bestows these blessings on you deservedly, which he does bestow. Now, the matter which I came here to ask, I'll first premise, after that I'll tell the subject of this Tragedy. Why have you contracted your brows? Is it because I said that this would be a Tragedy? I am a God, and I'll change it. This same, if you wish it, from a Tragedy I'll make to be a Comedy, with all the lines the same. Whether would ye it were so, or not? But I'm too foolish; as though I didn't know, who am a God, that you so wish it; upon this subject I understand what your feelings are. I'll make this to be a mixture--a Tragi-comedy<milestone n="59" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A Tragi- comedy</lemma>:  "Tragico-com&oelig;dia." This is said to be the only occasion in which Tragi-comedy is mentioned by any of the ancient authors. Plautus does not, however, use the term in the sense which we apply to it. Gods being generally introduced into Tragedy alone, but here taking part in a Comedy he thinks it may be fairly called a Tragi-comedy, or a Comedy with the characters of Tragedy. This play is thought by some to have been borrowed from the writings of Epicharmus, the Sicilian dramatist.</note>. For me to make it entirely to be a Comedy, where Kings and Gods appear, I do not deem right. What then? Since here the servant has a part as well, just as I said, I'll make it to be a Tragi-comedy. Now <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> has ordered me to beg this of you, that the inspectors<milestone n="65" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The inspectors</lemma>:  To the actor who was considered to give the most satisfaction to the Audience, it was customary for the &AElig;diles to present a reward, which they were bound to do without partiality. Officers, called "conquisitores," were consequently employed to go about the "cavea," or part of the theatre where the Audience sat, to see that there were no persons likely to have been hired for the purpose of applauding a particular actor.</note> should go among each of the seats throughout the whole theatre<milestone n="66" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Whole theatre</lemma>:  "Cavea." Literally, "the seats" or "benches" where the Audience sat</note>, amid the spectators, that, if they should see any suborned applauders of any actor, there should in the theatre be taken away from them the pledge of their coats, as a security for their good behaviour. But if any should solicit the palm of victory for the actors, or if for any artist, whether by written letters, or whether any person himself should solicit personally, or whether by messenger; or if the &AElig;diles, too, should unfairly adjudge to any one the reward; <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> has commanded the law to be the same as if he had sought by solicitation an appointment for himself or for another. By valour has he declared that you exist as victors, not by canvassing or unfair dealing. Why any the less should there be the same principle for the player, which there is for the greatest man? By merit, not by favourers, ought we to seek our ends. He who does aright has ever favourers enough, if there is honesty in them in whose disposal this matter<milestone n="80" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">This matter</lemma>:  The award of the prize.</note> rests. This, too, he directed me likewise in his injunctions, that there should be inspectors over the players; that, he who should have procured suborned persons to applaud himself, or he who should have contrived for another give less satisfaction, from the same they might strip off his dress and leather<milestone n="85" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Leather</lemma>:  "Corium." It is a matter of doubt whether this word means the "persona," or "leather mask" worn by the actors, or the actor's own hide or skin, which would suffer on his being flogged.</note> mask. I don't wish you to be surprised, for what reason <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> now concerns himself about actors. Don't be surprised, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> himself is about to take part in this play. Why are you wondering at this? As though, indeed, a new thing were now mentioned, that <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> takes to the calling of a player. But a year since<milestone n="91" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A year since</lemma>:  It is conjectured that he is here dealing a hit at some Poet who had recently introduced <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> on the stage, perhaps in an awkward manner or at an untimely moment--not as taking part himself in the piece, but at the prayer of some one of the characters. Horace reprehends a similar practice in his time: "Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus;" meaning, that a Deity may only be introduced when the circumstances are such as to warrant his interference.</note>, when here on the stage the actors invoked <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, he came; he aided them. Besides, surely in Tragedy he has a place. This play, I say, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> himself will take a part in this day, and I together with him. Now do you give attention while I shall relate to you the subject of this Comedy.</p>
<p>This city is <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; in that house there <stage>pointing</stage>, Amphitryon<milestone n="98" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Amphitryon</lemma>:  Perseus was the son of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> and Dana&euml;. By Andromeda, he was the father of Alc&aelig;us, Sthenelus, Nestor, and Electryon. Alc&aelig;us was the father of Amphitryon, while Electryon was the father of Alcmena, by Lysidice, the daughter of Pelops. Amphitryon, having accidentally slain Electryon, fled with his daughter Alcmena, who had been betrothed to him, to the court of Creon, King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. The brother of Alcmena having been slain by the Teleboans or Taphians, who inhabited certain islands on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, Amphitryon undertook an expedition against them, at the head of the forces of Creon.</note> dwells, born at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, of an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> sire; whose wife is Alcmena, daughter of Electryon. This Amphitrvon is now the general of the Theban troops; for between the Teleboans and the Theban people there is war. He, before he departed hence for the expedition, left his wife Alcmena pregnant. But I believe that you already know how my father is disposed how free in these affairs he has been, and how great a lover of many a woman, if any object once has captivated him. Unknown to her husband, he began to love Alcmena, and took temporary possession of her person for himself, and made her pregnant, too, by his embrace. Now, that more fully you may understand the matter with respect to Alcmena, she is pregnant by both; both by her husband and by supreme <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> And my father is now lying here <stage>he points to the house</stage> in-doors with her; and for this reason is this night made longer, while he is taking this pleasure with her whom he desires. But he has so disguised himself, as though he were Amphitryon. Now, that you may not be surprised at this dress of mine, inasmuch as I have come out here this way in servile garb, an ancient and an antique circumstance, made new, will I relate to you, by reason of which I have come to you attired in this new fashion; for lo! my father <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, now in the house, changes himself into the likeness of Amphitryon, and all the servants who see him think it is he, so shifting in his shape does he render himself when he chooses. I have taken on myself the form of the servant Sosia, who has gone hence together with Amphitryon on the expedition, that I may be able to serve my father in his amour, and that the servants may not be enquiring who I am, when they see me here frequenting oft the house. Now, as they will suppose me a servant and their fellow-servant, not any one will enquire who I am, or why I'm come. My father, now in-doors, is gratifying his inclination, and is embracing her of whom he is especially enamoured. What has been done there at the army, my father is now relating to Alcmena. She, who really is with a paramour, thinks that he is her own husband. There, my father is now relating how he has routed the legions of the enemy; how he has been enriched with abundant gifts. Those gifts which there were given to Amphitryon, we have carried off; what he pleases, my father easily performs. Now will Amphitryon come hither this day from the army, his servant too, whose form I am bearing. Now, that you may be able the more easily to distinguish between us, I always shall carry these little wings here <stage>pointing</stage> upon my broad-brimmed cap; then besides, for my father there will be a golden tuft beneath his cap; that mark will not be upon Amphitryon. These marks no one of these domestics will be able to see; but you will see them. But yonder is Sosia, the servant of Amphitryon; he is now coming yonder from the harbour, with a lantern. I will now drive him, as he arrives, away from the house. Attend, it will be worth the while of you spectators, for Jupiter and Mercury to perform here the actors' part.

<stage>Enter SOSIA, with a Lantern.</stage>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. What other person is there more bold than I, or who more stout of heart, who know the humours of young men<milestone n="154" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of young men</lemma>:  He alludes to the broils of the night, occasioned by the vagaries of wild and dissolute young men--perhaps not much unlike the Mohawks, whose outrageous pranks are mentioned in the Spectator and Swift's Journal to <placeName key="tgn,1093659">Stella</placeName>.</note>, and who am walking at this hour of night alone? What shall I do, if now the officers of the watch<milestone n="155" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Officers of the watch</lemma>:  Literally, the "Tresviri." As usual, though the Scene is laid in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, Roman usages are introduced by Plautus. The officers here mentioned were called "nocturni Tresviri." It was their province to take up all suspicious characters found abroad during the night. They were attended, probably, by lictors, or subordinate officers, who are here referred to as 'homines octo validi," "eight sturdy fellows."</note> should thrust me into prison. To-morrow shall I be dealt out from there<milestone n="156" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Dealt out from there</lemma>:  He compares the gaol, or place of confinement, to a store-closet, and means to say, that as food is brought thence to be dressed, so shall he be brought from the gaol to be dressed, in the way of having his back lashed.</note>, just as though from a store-closet, for a whipping; nor will it be allowed me to plead my cause, nor will there be a bit of aid from my master; nor will there be a person but that they will imagine, all of them, that I am deserving. And so will eight sturdy fellows be thumping on wretched me just like an anvil; in this way, just come from foreign parts, I shall be received with hospitality by the public. The inconsiderateness of my master compels me to this, who has packed me off from the harbour at this time of night whether I would or no. Couldn't he as well have sent me here by daylight? For this reason, is servitude to a man of high station a greater hardship; for this reason is the servant of a wealthy man the more wretched: both night and day, without ceasing, there is enough, and more than enough of work for him; for doing or for saying occasion is ever arising, so that you can't be at rest. The master, abounding in servants<milestone n="170" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Abounding in servants</lemma>:  "Dives operis." Literally, "rich in labour," abounding in slaves to labour for him.</note>, and free from labour himself; thinks that whatever he happens to choose, can be done; he thinks that just, and reckons not what the labour is; nor will he ever consider whether he commands a thing that's reasonable or unreasonable. Wherefore, in servitude many hardships do befall us; in pain this burden must be borne and endured.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> (<stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>). 'Twere with better reason for me to complain of servitude after this fashion; I, who to-day was free, and whom my father is now employing as a slave: this fellow is complaining, who was born a slave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. Really I am a rascal beyond a doubt; for only this moment it has suggested itself to me, that on my arrival I should give thanks, and address the Gods for their kindnesses vouchsafed. For surely, by my troth, if they were only desirous to give me a return according to my deserts, they would commission some person on my arrival soundly to box my ears, since those kindnesses which they have done me I have held as worthless and of no value.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. He does what people are not generally in the habit of doing, in knowing what his deserts are.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. What I never expected, nor any one else of my townsmen, to befall him, that same has come to pass, for us to come home safe and sound. Victorious, the enemy conquered, the troops are returning home, this very mighty war brought to an end, and the enemy slain. A city that has caused many a bitter death for the Theban people, that same has been conquered by the strength and valour of our soldiers, and taken by storm, under the command and conduct of my master Amphitryon in especial.

This was literally the allowance or largest of corn which was distributed to troops after a victory; hence it figuratively signifies "honor" or "glory."</note>, too, has he loaded his fellow-citizens, and for Creon, King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, has he firmly fixed his sway. From the harbour he has sent me before him to his house that I may bear these tidings to his wife, how he has promoted the public good by his guidance, conduct, and command. This now will I consider, in what manner I shall address her, when I've arrived there. If I tell a falsehood. I shall be doing as I am accustomed after my usual wont; for when they were fighting with all their might, then with all my might I ran away. But still I shall pretend as though I was present, and I'll tell her what I heard. But in what manner and with what expressions it is right for me to tell my story, I still wish first to consider here with myself. <stage>He assumes an attitude of thought.</stage> In these terms will I give this narrative. "In the first place, when we arrived there, when first we made land, Amphitryon immediately made choice of the powerful men among the chieftains. Those he despatched on the embassy, and bade them tell his mind to the Teleboans; that if without constraint and without warfare they should be ready to deliver up what was plundered and the plunderers, and if they should be ready to restore what they had carried off, he would immediately conduct the army homewards, that the Greeks would depart from their territory, and that he would grant peace and quietness to them : but if they should be otherwise disposed, and not concede the things which he demanded, he, in consequence, would attack their city with extreme violence and with his men. When the embassadors had repeated these things, which Amphitryon had enjoined, in order to the Teleboans, being men stout of heart, relying on their valour, and confident in their prowess, they rebuked our embassadors very rudely. They answered that they were able in warfare to protect themselves and theirs, and that at once they must lead the army with all haste out of their territories. When the embassadors brought back this message, straightway Amphitryon drew out all his army from the encampment; on the other side, the Teleboans led forth their legions from the town, furnished with most gorgeous arms. After they had gone forth on either side in full array, the soldiers were marshalled, the ranks were formed. We, after our manner and usage, drew up our legions; the enemy, too, drew up their legions facing us. Then either general went forth into the mid-space beyond the throng of the ranks, and they parleyed together. It was agreed between them, that, which ever side should be conquered in that battle, they should surrender up their city, lands, altars, hearths. and theraselves. After that was done, the trumpets on either side gave the signal; the earth re-echoed, they raised a shout on either side. Each general, both upon this side and on that, offered vows to <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, and then encouraged his troops. Each man according to his ability does that which each one can and has the strength to do; he smites with his falchion; the weapons crash; the welkin bellows with the uproar of the men; of breaths and pantings a cloud is formed; men fall by wounds inflicted by men. At length, as we desired, our troops conquered; the foe fell in numbers; ours, on the other hand, pressed on; firm in our strength, we were victorious. But still not one betook himself to flight, nor yet gave way at his post, but standing there<milestone n="239" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Standing there</lemma>:  This seems to be the true meaning of "statim" in this passage.</note> he waged the combat. Sooner than quit the spot, they parted with their lives; each, as he stood, lay there and kept his rank in death. When my master Amphitryon saw this, at once he ordered the cavalry on the right to charge. The cavalry obeyed directly; from the right wing, with a tremendous shout, with brisk onset they rushed on; and rightfully did they slaughter and trample down the impious forces of the foe."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Not even one word of these has he yet uttered correctly; for I was there in the battle personally, and my father too, when it was fought.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>continuing</stage>. "The enemy betook themselves to flight. Then was new spirit added to our men, the Teleboans flying, with darts were their bodies filled, and Amphitryon himself, with his own hand, struck off the head of Pterelas their king. This battle was being fought there even from the morning till the evening. This do I the better remember for this reason; because on that day I went without my breakfast. But night at last, by its interposing, cut short this combat. The next day, the chiefs came weeping from the city to us at the camp. With covered hands<milestone n="257" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With covered hands</lemma>:  He alludes here to the carrying of the "velamenta," which were branches of olive, surrounded with bandages of wool, and held in the hands of those who sued for mercy or pardon.

Lastly, by reason of his valour, a golden goblet was presented to my master Amphitryon, from which king Pterelas<milestone n="261" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">King Pterelas</lemma>:  Pterela, or Pterelas, was the son of Hippotho&euml;, the cousin of Amphitryon and Alcmena.

Cymetho, smitten with love for Amphitryon, or, according to some accounts, for Cephalus, his associate in the enterprise, cut off the fatal lock, and, like Scylla, betrayed her father, who was afterwards slain by Amphitryon.</note> had been used to drink." These things I'll thus tell my mistress. I'll now proceed to obey my master's order and to betake me home. <stage>He moves.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Heyday! he's about to come this way; I'll go meet him; and I'll not permit this fellow at any time to-day to approach this house. Since I have his form upon myself, I'm resolved to play the fellow off. And indeed, since I have taken upon me his figure and his station, it is right for me likewise to have actions and manners like to his. Therefore it befits me to be artful, crafty, very cunning, and by his own weapon, artfulness, to drive him from the door. But what means this? He is looking up at the sky. I'll watch what scheme he's about.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>looking up at the sky</stage>. Upon my faith, for sure, if there is aught besides that I believe, or know for certain, I do believe that this night the God of Night<milestone n="272" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">God of Night</lemma>:  "Nocturnus" is generally supposed here to mean the "God of Night," though some Commentators have fancied that by it the Evening Star is signified.</note> has gone to sleep drunk; for neither does the Wain move itself in any direction in the sky, nor does the Moon bestir herself anywhere from where she first arose; nor does Orion<milestone n="275" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Nor does Orion</lemma>:  "Jugula" means either the three stars composing the girdle of Orion or the Constellation Orion itself. It also was the name of two stars in the Constellation Cancer, or the Crab, which were also called "Aselli," or "the Little Asses." The plural, "Jugul&aelig;," is more generally used. "Septentriones" was a name of the "Ursa Major," or "Greater Bear," also called by us "Charles's Wain." It received its name from "septem," "seven," and "terriones," "oxen that ploughed the earth," from its fancied resemblance to a string of oxen.</note>, or the Evening Star<milestone n="275" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Evening Star</lemma>:  "Vesperugo" is a name of Hesperus, or the Evening Star; while the Constellation of the Pleiades was sometimes known by the name of "Vergili&aelig;."</note>, or the Pleiades, set.

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. I do not think that I have ever seen a longer night than this, except one of like fashion, which livelong night I was hanging up, having been first whipped. Even that as well, by my troth, does this one by far exceed in its length. I' faith, I really do believe that the Sun's asleep, and is thoroughly drenched. It's a wonder to me if he hasn't indulged himself a little too much at dinner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Do you really say so, you scoundrel? Do you think that the Gods are like yourself? I' faith, you hang-dog, I'll entertain you for these speeches and misdeeds of yours; only come this way, will you, and you'll find your ruin.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I'm quite undone, my teeth are chattering. For sure, on my arrival, he is about to receive me with the hospitality of his fist. He's a merciful person, I suppose; now, because my master has obliged me to keep awake, with his fists just now he'll be making me go to sleep. I'm most confoundedly undone. Troth now, prithee, look, how big and how strong he is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I'll talk at him aloud, he shall hear what I say. Therefore indeed, in a still greater degree, shall he conceive fears within himself. <stage>In a loud voice, holding up his fists.</stage> Come, fists, it's a long time now since you found provision for my stomach; it seems to have taken place quite a long time ago, when yesterday you laid four men asleep, stript naked.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> The weight of this fist is no poor one.</p></sp>

Has not my master sent me here? Am I not now standing before our house? Have I not a lantern in my hand? Am I not talking? Am I not wide awake? Has not this fellow been thumping me with his fists?

Hypercritical Commentators have observed, that Plautus is guilty in this Play of a grammatical anachronism, in putting the expletive, "Hercle," in the mouths of persous at a time when Hercules is supposed to be yet unborn. They might with as much justice accuse him of anachronism in putting the Roman language into the mouths of persons at a time when that language did not as yet exist. He merely professes to embody the sentiments of persons in bygone days in such language as may render them the most easily intelligible to a Roman audience.</note>, he has been doing so; for even now, to my pain, my cheeks are tingling.

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Indeed it really is so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Why, all that you have been saying just now, you have trumped up; I surely am Amphitryon's Sosia. For in the night this ship of ours weighed anchor from the Persian port, and where king Pterelas reigned, the city we took by storm, and the legions of the Teleboans in fighting we took by arms, and Amphitryon himself cut off the head of king Pterelas in battle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> A golden goblet, from which king Pterelas used to drink.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. He has said the truth. Where now is this goblet?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. He has overpowered me with his proofs. I must look out for another name. I don't know from whence he witnessed these things. I'll now entrap him finely; for what I did alone by myself, and when not another person was present in the tent, that, he certainly will never be able this day to tell me. <stage>Aloud.</stage> If you are Sosia, when the armies were fighting most vigorously, what were you doing in the tent?

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Do you deny that I am?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Why should I not deny it, who am he myself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> By Jupiter I swear that I am he, and that I do not say false.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> But by Mercury, I swear that Jupiter does not believe you; for I am sure that he will rather credit me without an oath than you with an oath.</p></sp>

Probably the expense of them did not allow of their being used by slaves. The "specula," or "looking-glasses," of the ancients, were usually made of metal, either a composition of tin and copper or of silver; but in later times, alloy was mixed with the silver. Pliny mentions the obsidian stone, or, as it is now called, Icelandic agate, as being used for this purpose. He also says that mirrors were made in the glass-houses of Sidon, which consisted of glass plates with leaves of metal at the back. These were probably of an inferior character. Those of copper and tin were made chiefly at Brundisium. The white metal formed from this mixture soon becoming dim, a sponge, with powdered pumice-stone, was usually fastened to the mirrors made of that composition. They were generally small, of round or oval shape, and having a handle. The female slaves usually held them while their mistresses were performing the duties of the toilet. Sometimes they were fastened to the walls, and they were occasionally of the length of a person's body, like the cheval glasses of our day</note>): , he is exactly like me. He has the broad-brimmed hat and clothing just the same; he is as like me as I am myself. His leg, foot, stature, shorn head, eyes, nose, even his lips, cheeks, chin, beard, neck--the whole of him. What need is there of words? If his back is marked with scars, than this likeness there is nothing more like. But when I reflect, really, I surely am the same person that I always was.

Douza, however, thinks that he is playing upon the expression "ludos facere," which has the double meaning of "to impose upon" a person, or "to give a spectacle" of gladiators after the death of a person of Patrician rank; and that he means to say that the act "<foreign lang="la">ludos faciendi</foreign>" is being applied to him (in the first sense):  while alive, a thing that (in the second sense) will never befall him when dead.</note>.

<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Well and prosperously has this affair gone on for me; from the door have I removed the greatest obstacle, so that it may be allowed my father to embrace her in security. When now he shall have reached his master, Amphitryon there, he will say that the servant Sosia has repulsed himself from the door here; and then the other will suppose that he is telling him a lie, and will not believe that he has come here as he had ordered him. Both of them and the whole household of Amphitryon I will fill with mistakes and distraction, even until my father shall have had full enjoyment of her whom he loves; then at last all shall know what has been done. In the end Jupiter shall restore Alcmena to the former affection of her husband. For Amphitryon will just now be beginning a quarrel with his wife, and will be accusing her of incontinence; then will my father change for her this strife into tranquillity. Now, inasmuch as yet I've said but little about Alcmena, this day will she bring forth two sons, twins; the one will be born in the tenth month after he was begotten, the other in the seventh month<milestone n="482" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In the seventh month</lemma>:  It is difficult to imagine how a critic can suppose that the duration of this Play is intended to be seven months, merely because, according to the ancient story, Hercules was born seven months after the intercourse of Jupiter with Alcmena. Heinsius and Vossius, however, were of this extraordinary opinion. They probably did not reflect that Plautus, for the sake of finding material for his Play, supposed the same intercourse to have been repeated on the same night on which Hercules was born.</note>; of these the one is the son of Amphitryon<milestone n="483" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Son of Amphitryon</lemma>:  Iphiclus was the son of Amphitryon.</note>, the other of Jupiter.

Although, as I have said just now, Amphitryon shall still know all the matter in the end. What then? No one surely will impute it to Alcmena as a disgrace; for it does not seem that a God is acting justly to permit his own offences and his own faultiness to fall upon a mortal. I'll cut short my talk: the door makes a noise. See, the counterfeit Amphitryon is coming out of doors, and together with him Alcmena, the wife that he has taken the loan of.

If it was not taken up, it was disowned, and left to starve. For this reason Jupiter makes this request of Alcmena.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> What business is this, my husband, since you thus suddenly leave your home?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> By my troth, 'tis not that I am wearied of you or of my home; but when the chief commander is not with the army, that is sooner done which ought not to be done than that which needs to be done.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Some mischief, I know not what, has befallen this fellow from an evil hand<milestone n="605" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">An evil hand</lemma>:  " Mal&acirc; manu." In this line these words relate to sorcery or enchantment, probably through spells, in which the hand was employed. Sosia takes the opportunity of punning, by understanding the words in their literal sense. " Evil hand," indeed, he says, "when I have been almost mauled to death with fists."</note> since he left me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I confess it; for I have been most shockingly bruised with his fists.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Who has been beating you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I myself, who am now at home, beat me myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Take you care to say nothing but what I shall ask you. Now, do you answer me. First of all, who this Sosia is, of that I want to be informed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> He is your servant.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Really I have even more than I desire by your own one self. Never, too, since I was born, had I a servant Sosia besides yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> But now, Amphitryon, I say this; I'll make you, I say, on your arrival, meet with another Sosia at home, a servant of yours, besides myself, a son of Davus, the same father with myself, of figure and age as well just like myself. What need is there of words? This Sosia of yours is become twofold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You talk of things extremely wonderful. But did you see my wife? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Nay, but it was never allowed me to go in-doors into the house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Who hindered you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> This Sosia, whom I was just now telling of, he who thumped me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Who is this Sosia? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Myself, I say; how often must it be told you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> But how say you? Have you been sleeping the while? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Not the slightest in the world.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Then, perhaps, you might perchance have seen some Sosia in your dreams.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I am not in the habit of performing the orders of my master in a sleepy fashion. Awake I saw him, awake I now see you, awake I am talking, awake did he, a little while since, thump me about with his fists.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What person did so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Sosia, that I myself,--he, I say. Prithee, don't you understand?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How, the plague, can any one possibly understand? You are jabbering such nonsense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> But you'll know him shortly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Whom? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> You'll know this servant Sosia.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Follow me this way, then; for it is necessary for me first to enquire into this. But take care that all the things that I ordered are now brought from the ship.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I am both mindful and diligent that what you order shall be performed; together with the wine, I have not drunk up your commands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> May the Gods grant, that, in the event, what you have said may prove untrue. <stage>They stand apart.</stage>

<stage>Enter ALCMENA, from the house, attended by THESSALA.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Is not the proportion of pleasures in life and in passing our existence short in comparison with what is disagreable? So it is allotted to each man in life; so has it pleased the Gods that Sorrow should attend on Pleasure as her companion; but if aught of good befalls us, more of trouble and of ill forthwith attends us. For this do I now feel by experience at home and in relation to myself, to whom delight has been imparted for a very short time, while I had the opportunity of seeing my husband for but one night; and now has he suddenly gone away hence from me before the dawn. Deserted do I now seem to myself, because he is absent from here, he whom before all I love. More of grief have I felt from the departure of my husband, than of pleasure from his arrival. But this, at least, makes me happy, that he has conquered the foe, and has returned home loaded with glory. Let him be absent, if only with fame acquired he betakes himself home. I shall bear and ever endure his absence with mind resolved and steadfast; if only this reward is granted me, that my husband shall be hailed the conqueror in the warfare, sufficient for myself will I deem it. Valour is the best reward; valour assuredly surpasses all things: liberty, safety, life, property and parents, country too, and children, by it are defended and preserved. Valour comprises everything in itself: all blessings attend him in whose possession is valour.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. By my troth, I do believe that I shall come much wished for by my wife, who loves me, and whom, in return, I love: especially, our enterprise crowned with success, the enemy vanquished, whom no one had supposed to be able to be conquered: these, under my conduct and command, at the first meeting, have we vanquished; but I know for sure that I shall come to her much wished for.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Well, and don't you think that I shall come much wished for to my mistress?
<stage>SOSIA.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> <stage>to herself</stage>. Surely, this is my husband.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>to SOSIA</stage>. Do you follow me this way.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> <stage>to herself</stage>. But why has he returned, when just now he said that he was in haste? Is he purposely trying me, and is he desirous to make proof of this, how much I regret his departure? By my faith, against no inclination of mine has he betaken himself home.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Amphitryon, it were better for us to return to the ship. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> For what reason?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Because there's no person at home to give us a breakfast on our arrival.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How comes that now into your mind?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Why, because we have come too late.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Because I see Alcmena standing before the house, with her stomach-full<milestone n="667" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Stomach-full</lemma>:  He is guilty of a vulgar pun on the word "saturam," which may either mean "having a full stomach" or "being pregnant."</note> already.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I left her pregnant here when I went away.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Alas, to my sorrow, I'm undone!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What's the matter with you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I have come home just in good time to fetch the water<milestone n="669" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To fetch the water</lemma>:  He alludes to the practice among the ancients of bathing immediately after childbirth, and says that he himself, as the servant, will have to fetch the buckets of water</note> in the tenth month after that, according as I understand you to compute the reckoning.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Be of good heart. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Do you know of how good heart I am? By my troth, do you never after this day entrust to me aught that is sacred, if I don't draw up all the life of that well, if I do but make a beginning.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Do you only follow me this way. I'll appoint another person for that business; don't you fear.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> <stage>advancing</stage>. I think that I shall now be doing my duty more, if I go to meet him. <stage>(They meet.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> With joy, Amphitryon greets his longed for wife--her, whom of all women in Thebes her husband deems by far the most excellent, and whom so much the Theban citizens truthfully extol as virtuous. Have you fared well all along? Do I arrive much wished for by you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I never saw one more so; for she greets her own husband not a bit more than a dog.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> When I see you pregnant, and so gracefully burdened, I am delighted.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Prithee, in the name of all that's good, why, for the sake of mockery, do you thus salute and address me, as though you hadn't lately seen me--as though now, for the first time, you were betaking yourself homeward here from the enemy? For now you are addressing me just as though you were seeing me after a long time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Why, really for my part, I have not seen you at all this day until now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Why do you deny it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Because I have learned to speak the truth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> He does not do right, who unlearns the same that he has learned. Are you making trial what feelings I possess? But why are you returning hither so soon? Has an ill omen delayed you, or does the weather keep you back, you who have not gone away to your troops, as you were lately speaking of?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Lately? How long since was this "lately?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> You are trying me; but very lately, just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Prithee, how can that possibly be as you say?--"but very lately, just now."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Why, what do you imagine? That I, on the other hand, shall trifle with you who are playing with me, in saying that you are now come for the first time, you who but just now went away from here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Surely she is talking deliriously.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Stop a little while, until she has slept out this one sleep.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Is she not dreaming with her eyes open?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, for my part I really am awake, and awake I am relating that which has happened; for, but lately, before daybreak, I saw both him <stage>pointing at SOSIA</stage> and yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> In what place?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Here, in the house where you yourself dwell.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> It never was the fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Will you not hold your peace? What if the vessel brought us here from the harbour in our sleep?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Are you, too, going to back her as well?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>aside to AMPHITRYON</stage>. What do you wish to be done? Don't you know, if you wish to oppose a raving Bacchanal, from a mad woman you'll render her more mad--she'll strike the oftener<milestone n="704" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Strike the oftener</lemma>:  This is said in allusion to the blows with the thyrsus, which the frantic female votaries of Bacchus inflicted upon all persons that they met.</note>; if you humour her, after one blow you may overcome her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> But, by my troth, this thing is resolved upon, somehow to rate her who this day has been unwilling to greet me on my arrival home.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> You'll only be irritating hornets.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You hold your tongue. Alcmena, I wish to ask you one thing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Ask me anything you please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Is it frenzy that has come upon you, or does pride overcome you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> How comes it into your mind, my husband, to ask me that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Because formerly you used to greet me on my arrival, and to address me in such manner as those women who are virtuous are wont their husbands. On my arrival home I've found that you have got rid of that custom.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> By my faith, indeed, I assuredly did both greet you yesterday, upon your arrival, at that very instant, and at the same time I enquired if you had continued in health all along, my husband, and I took your hand and gave you a kiss.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What, did you welcome him yesterday?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> And you too, as well, Sosia.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Amphitryon, I did hope that she was about to bring you forth a son; but she isn't gone with child.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> With madness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Really I am in my senses, and I pray the Gods that in safety I may bring forth a son; but <stage>to SOSIA</stage> hap-ill shall you be having, if he does his duty: for those ominous words, omen-maker, you shall catch what befits you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Why really an apple<milestone n="723" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">An apple</lemma>:  There is a pun here upon the similarity of the two words "malum," "evil," and "malum," an "apple," in which latter sense Sosia chooses to take the expression of Alcmena. The version of the pun used in the text is borrowed from Thornton's Translation. In a Note, he wonders "why an apple (or any fruit) should be given to a pregnant woman." Sosia seems to explain the reason, in saying that if she feels faint, she will have something to gnaw. It is not improbable that tension of the muscles may in some degree counteract a tendency to faint. This wretched pun is repeated in l. 1032</note> ought to be given to the lady thus pregnant, that there may be something for her to gnaw if she should begin to faint.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Did you see me here yesterday?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I did, I say, if you wish it to be ten times repeated.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> In your sleep, perhaps?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> No--I, awake, saw you awake. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Woe to me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What's the matter with you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> My wife is mad. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> She's attacked with black bile; nothing so soon turns people mad.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> When, madam, did you first find yourself affected?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Why really, upon my faith, I'm well, and in my senses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Why, then, do you say that you saw me yesterday, whereas we were brought into harbour but last night? There did I dine, and there did I rest the livelong night on board ship, nor have I set my foot even here into the house, since, with the army, I set out hence against the Teleboan foe, and since we conquered them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> On the contrary, you dined with me, and you slept with me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I'm telling the truth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> On my honor, not in this matter, really; about other </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MATTERS</speaker><p> I don't know. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> At the very break of dawn you went away to your troops.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> By what means could I?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> She says right, according as she remembers; she's telling you her dream. But, madam, after you arose, you ought to have sacrificed to Jove, the disposer of prodigies<milestone n="739" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Disposer of prodigies</lemma>:  See the Miles Gloriosus, l. 394, and the Note to the passage.</note>, either with a salt cake or with frankincense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> A mischief on your head!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> That's your own business, if you take due care.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Now again this fellow is talking rudely to me, and that without punishment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>to SOSIA</stage>. You hold your tongue. <stage>To ALCMENA.</stage> Do you tell me now--did I go away hence from you at daybreak?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Who then but your own self recounted to me how the battle went there? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> And do you know that as well?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Why, I heard it from your own self, how you had taken a very large city, and how you yourself had slain king Pterelas.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What, did I tell you this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> You yourself, this Sosia standing by as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>to SOSIA</stage>. Have you heard me telling about this to-day? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Where should I have heard you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Ask her. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> In my presence, indeed, it never took place, that I know of.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> It would be a wonder<milestone n="750" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">It would be a wonder</lemma>:  She says this ironically.</note> if he didn't contradict you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Sosia, come here and look at me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>looks at him</stage>. I am looking at you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I wish you to tell the truth, and I don't want you to humour me. Have you heard me this day sav to her these things which she affirms?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Prithee now, by my troth, are you, too, mad as well, when you ask me this, me, who, for my part, my own self now behold her in company with you for the first time?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How now, madam? Do you hear him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I do, indeed, and telling an untruth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Do you believe neither him nor my own self, your husband?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> No; for this reason it is, because I most readily believe myself, and I am sure that these things took place just as I relate them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Do you say that I came yesterday?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Do you deny that you went away from here to-day?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I really do deny it, and I declare that I have now come home to you for the first time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Prithee, will you deny this too, that you to-day made me a present of a golden goblet, with which you said that you had been presented?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> By heavens, I neither gave it nor told you so: but I had so intended, and do so now, to present you with that goblet. But who told you this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Why, I heard it from yourself, and I received the goblet from your own hand. <stage>She moves as if going.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Stay, stay, I entreat you. Sosia, I marvel much how she knows that I was presented there with this golden goblet, unless you have lately met her and told her all this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, I have never told her, nor have I ever beheld her except with yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What is the matter<milestone n="769" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">What is the matter</lemma>:  It is disputed among the Commentators to which character these words belong, Amphitryon or Alcmena</note> with this person?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I should like it; to be produced
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Be it so. Do you go, Thessala, and bring from indoors the goblet, with which my husband presented me today. <stage>THESSALA goes into the house, and AMPHITRYON and SOSIA walk on one side.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Sosia, do you step this way. Really, I do wonder extremely at this beyond the other wondrous matters, if she has got this goblet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> And do you believe it, when it's carried in this casket, sealed with your own seal. <stage>He shows the casket.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Is the seal whole? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Examine it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>examining it</stage>. All right, it's just as I sealed it up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Prithee, why don't you order her to be purified<milestone n="776" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To be purified</lemma>:  "Circumferri."

<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> By my troth, somehow there's need for it, for, i' faith, she's certainly filled with sprites.

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> What need is there of talking? See, here's the goblet; here it is. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Come, now then, look here, if you please, you who deny what is fact, and whom I shall now clearly convict in this case. Isn't this the goblet with which you were presented there?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Supreme Jupiter! what do I behold? Surely this is that goblet. Sosia, I'm utterly confounded.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, either this woman is a most consummate juggler, or the goblet must be in here <stage>pointing to the casket</stage>. AMPH. Come, then, open this casket.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Why should I open it? It is securely sealed. The thing is cleverly contrived; you have brought forth another Amphitryon, I have brought forth another Sosia; now if the goblet has brought forth a goblet, we have all produced our doubles.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I'm determined to open and examine it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Look, please, how the seal is, that you may not hereafter throw the blame on me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Now do open it. For she certainly is desirous to drive us mad with her talking.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Whence then came this which was made a present to me, but from yourself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> It's necessary for me to enquire into this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>opening the casket</stage>. Jupiter, O Jupiter!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What is the matter with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> There's no goblet here in the casket.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What do I hear. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> That which is the truth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> But at your peril now, if it does not make its appearance.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> The person that's asking me the question.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>to AMPHITRYON</stage>. You are on the catch for me, inasmuch as you yourself have secretly run before me hither from the ship by another road, and have taken the goblet away from here and given it to her, and afterwards you have secretly sealed it up again.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Ah me! and are you too helping her frenzy as well? <stage>To ALCMENA</stage> Do you say that we arrived here yesterday? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I do say so, and on your arrival you instantly greeted me, and I you, and I gave you a kiss.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> You said that you were inclined to go to sleep; the table was removed; thence we went to bed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Where did you lie?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> In the chamber, in the same bed together with your. self. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What's the matter with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> This very moment has she sent me to my grave.

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> How so, pray? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Don't address me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What's the matter with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> To my sorrow I'm undone, since, in my absence from here, dishonor has befallen her chastity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> In heaven's name, my lord, why, I beseech you, do I hear this from you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I, your lord? False one, don't call me by a false name.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> What have I done, by reason of which these expressions are uttered to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You yourself proclaim your own doings; do you enquire of me in what you have offended?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> In what have I offended you, if I have been with you to whom I am married?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You, been with me? What is there of greater effrontery than this impudent woman? At least, if you were wanting in modesty of your own, you might have borrowed it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> That criminality which you lay to my charge befits not my family. If you try to catch me in incontinence, you cannot convict me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Immortal Gods! do you at least know me, Sosia?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Pretty well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Did I not dine yesterday on board ship in the Persian Port?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I have witnesses as well, who can confirm that which I say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I don't know what to say to this matter, unless, perchance, there is another Amphitryon, who, perhaps, though you yourself are absent, takes care of your business, and who, in your absence, performs your duties here. For about that counterfeit Sosia it is very surprising. Certainly, about this Amphitryon, now, it is another matter still more surprising.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Some magician, I know not who, is bewildering this woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> By the realms of the supreme Sovereign I swear, and by Juno, the matron Goddess, whom for me to fear and venerate it is most especially fitting, that no mortal being<milestone n="833" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">No mortal being</lemma>:  Unknowingly, Alcmena has a salvo here for the untruth, which, unconsciously, she would be otherwise telling; Jupiter not being a mortal.</note> except yourself alone has ever touched my person in contact with his so as to render me unchaste.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I could wish that that was true.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I speak the truth, but in vain, since you will not believe me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You are a woman; you swear at random.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> She who has not done wrong, her it befits to be bold and to speak confidently and positively in her own behalf.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> That's very boldly said.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Just as befits a virtuous woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Say you so? By your own words you prove it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> That which is called a dowry, I do not deem the same my dowry; but chastity, and modesty, and subdued desires, fear of the Gods, and love of my parents, and concord with my kindred; to be obedient to yourself and bounteous to the good, ready to aid the upright.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Surely, by my troth, if she tells the truth in this, she's perfect to the very ideal<milestone n="843" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the very ideal</lemma>:  "Examussim."

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Surely you are Amphitryon; take you care, please, that you don't peradventure lose yourself; people are changing in such a fashion since we came from abroad.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Madam, I'm resolved not to omit having this matter enquired into.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How say you? Answer me; what if I bring your own kinsman, Naucrates, hither from the ship, who, together with me, has been brought on board the same ship; and if he denies that that has happened which you say has happened, what is proper to be done to you?

<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> I am that Amphitryon, whose servant Sosia is the same that becomes Mercury when there is occasion--I, who dwell in the highest story<milestone n="863" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The highest story</lemma>:  "C&aelig;naculo." "C&aelig;naculum" was a name given to garrets, or upper rooms, which were let out as lodgings to the poorer classes. The word here conveys a double sense, either as signifying the elevated habitation of the heavenly Jove or the humble lodging of the poor actor who is performing the part. Perhaps our cant term, "sky-parlour," which is sometimes applied to a garret, would be the happiest translation here of the word.</note>, who sometimes, when it pleases me, become Jupiter. But, hither soon as ever I turn my steps, I become Amphitryon that moment, and I change my garb. Now hither am I come for the sake of a compliment to you, that I may not leave this Comedy incomplete. I've come as well to bring assistance to Alcmena, whom, guiltless woman, her husband Amphitryon is accusing of dishonor, For what I myself have brought about, if that undeservedly should fall as an injury upon her in her innocence, it would be my blame. Now, as I have already begun, I'll again pretend that I am Amphitryon, and this day will I introduce extreme confusion into this household. Then afterwards, at last, I'll cause the matter to be disclosed, and to Alcmena timely aid will I bring, and will cause that at one birth she shall bring forth, without pangs<milestone n="879" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Without pangs</lemma>:  "Sine doloribus." Plautus has been censured here for inconsistency, as at the close of the Play he appears to represent Alcmena as enduring the pangs of childbirth; but it is to be remembered that is only the account given by Bromia, and, according to what was her impression, on hearing Alcmena invoke the Deities.</note>, both the child with which she is pregnant by her husband and that with which she is pregnant by myself. I have ordered Mercury forthwith to follow me, if I should wish to give him any commands. Now will I accost her. <stage>He stands apart.</stage></p></sp></div2>

<stage>Enter ALCMENA, from the house.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I cannot remain in the house. That I should be thus accused by my husband of dishonor, incontinence, and disgrace! he cries aloud that things which have been done, have really not been done; and of things which have not been done, and of which I have not been guilty, he accuses me, and supposes that I shall treat it with indifference. By heavens, I will not do so, nor will I allow myself to be falsely charged with dishonor; but rather I'll either leave him, or make him give satisfaction and swear as well<milestone n="889" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Swear as well</lemma>:  It was considered a sufficient atonement, if the accuser took an oath that his accusation was wrongful; and his oath was considered to wipe off the injury.</note> that he wishes unsaid the things which he has alleged against me in my innocence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. This must be done by me, which she requires to be done, if I wish for her to receive me into her company as loving her: since that which I have done, that same conduct has proved to the detriment of Amphitryon, and since my love has already created trouble for him who is really guiltless, why now his wrath and his resentment towards her shall fall on me that am not accused.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> And lo! I see him, who just now was accusing wretched me of incontinence and dishonor.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> <stage>advancing</stage>. Wife, I would discourse with you. <stage>She turns from him.</stage> Why turn yourself away?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Such is my disposition; I always hate to look upon my enemies.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> It is so, I speak the truth; unless you are going to allege that this is falsely said as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> <stage>offering to embrace her</stage>. You are too angry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> <stage>repulsing him</stage>. Can't you keep your hands off? For surely if you were wise, or quite in your senses, with her, whom you deem and pronounce to be unchaste, you would neither hold discourse, in mirth or in seriousness, unless, indeed, you are more foolish than the most foolish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> If I did say so, not a bit the more are you so, nor do I think you so, and therefore have I returned hither that I might excuse myself to you. For never has anything proved more grievous to my feelings than when I heard that you were angry with me. "Why did you charge me?" you will say. I'll tell you; by my troth, not that I deemed you to be unchaste; but I was trying your feelings, what you would do, and in what manner you would bring yourself to bear it. Really, I said these things to you just now in jest, for the sake of the joke. Do but ask Sosia this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> But why don't you bring here my kinsman, Naucrates, whom you said just now that you would bring as a witness that you had not come here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> If anything was said in joke, it isn't right for you to take it in earnest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I know how much this has pained me at heart.</p></sp>

If in that I deceive you, then, thee, supreme Jupiter, do I entreat that thou wilt ever be angered against<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Ever be angered against</lemma>:  This oath is similar in its absurdity to that of Mercury, in l. 392.

<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> Oh! rather may he prove propitious.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> I trust that it will be so; for before you have I taken a truthful oath. Now then, you are not angry?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> I am not. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> You act properly. For in the life of mortals many things of this nature come to pass; and now they take their pleasures, again they meet with hardships. Quarrels intervene, again do they become reconciled. But it perchance any quarrels of this nature happen between them, when again they have become reconciled, twofold more loving are they between themselves than they were before.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCMENA</speaker><p> At the first you ought to have been careful not to say so; but if you excuse yourself to me for the same, it must be put up with.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> But bid the sacred vessels to be got ready for me, that I may fulfil all those vows which I made when with the army, in case I should return safe home.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Has peace been made then between you two? But since I see you in good humour, I'm delighted, and it is a pleasure to myself. And so does it seem becoming for a trusty servant to conduct himself; just as his superiors are, so should he be likewise; by their countenances he should fashion his own countenance; if his superiors are grave, let him be grave; if they rejoice, let him be merry. But come, answer me; have you two now come to a reconciliation?</p></sp>

In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master Charinus, to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in the ship by his father Demipho; in the Stichus, Dinacium (Pinacium), a slave, informs his mistress Panegyris (Philumena) that her husband has put into port on his return from Asia; and in the Mostellaria, Tranio brings information of the unexpected coming of Theuropides, an old gentleman. Terence has censured the like practice, in the Prologue to the Self-Tormentor."</note>? He is bringing news that the ship is safe, or else the approach of some angry old blade; whereas I am obeying the bidding of Jove, and by his command do I now hie me. For this reason, it is more fitting to get out of the road and to make room for me. My father calls me, I am following him, to his orders so given am I obedient. As it befits a son to be dutiful to his father, just so am I to my father; in his amours I play second fiddle to him, I encourage him, assist him, advise him, rejoice with him. If anything is pleasing to my father, that pleasure is an extremely great one for myself. Is he amorously disposed? He is wise; he does right, inasmuch as he follows his inclination; a thing that all men ought to do, so long as it is done in a proper manner. Now, my father wishes Amphitryon to be cajoled; I'll take care, Spectators, that he shall be rarely cajoled, while you look on. I'll place a chaplet on my head, and pretend that I am drunk. And up there <stage>pointing to the top of the house</stage> will I get; from that spot, at the top of the house, I'll cleverly drive this person off when he comes hither: I'll take care that, sober, he shall be drenched. Afterwards, his own servant Sosia will presently be suffering the punishment for it; he'll be accusing him of doing, this day, the things which I myself have done what's that to me? It's proper for me to be obedient to my father; it's right to be subservient to his pleasure. But see! here is Amphitryon; he's coming. Now shall he be rarely fooled, if, indeed, <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage> you are willing, by listening, to lend your attention.

<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Slave! for your own torture do you give vent to these expressions this day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Now I'm performing a sacrifice to you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> How? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Why, because I devote you to ill-luck<milestone n="1034" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Devote you to ill-luck</lemma>:  "Macto infortunio." "Macto," which properly signified "to amplify," was especially applied to the act of sacrificing, by way of giving something. Mercury here says in sport, that he makes Amphitryon an offering of--a jug of water, or perhaps a tile, it is not known for certain which; but it is generally supposed that in some part of this Scene, as originally written, he does throw water at him.</note> with this libation. <stage>Throws water on him.</stage> <gap/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What, you, devote me<milestone n="1034a" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You, devote me</lemma>:  This line commences the portion that is supposed by many of the Commentators not to have been written by Plautus, it not being found in most of the MSS. By those, however, who deny it to have been his composition, it is generally thought to have been composed by an ancient writer, and not to be at all deficient in humour and genuine Comic spirit. Gueudeville and Echard speak in high terms of it; and the learned Schmieder is unwilling to believe that it is not the composition of Plautus.</note>, you villain? If the Gods have not this day taken away my usual form, I'll take care that you shall be laden with bull's hide thongs, you victim of Saturn<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Victim of Saturn</lemma>:  Taubmann remarks that there is here an allusion to those slaves which the Carthaginians were in the habit of purchasing in order to sacrifice them, in place of their children, to Saturn--a rite borrowed from the same source as the passing of children through fire to Moloch, as practised by the Ph&oelig;nicians.</note>. So surely will I devote you to the cross and to torture. Come out of doors, you whip-knave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> You shadowy ghost--you, frighten me with your threats? If you don't betake yourself off from here this instant, if you knock once more, if the door makes a noise with your little finger even, I'll break your head with this tile, so that with your teeth you may sputter out your tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What, rascal, would you be for driving me away from my own house? What, would you hinder me from knocking at my own door? I'll this instant tear it from off all its hinges.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Do you persist? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I do persist.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Take that, then. <stage>Throws a tile at him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Scoundrel! at your master? If I lay hands upon you this day, I'll bring you to that pitch of misery, that you shall be miserable for evermore.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Surely, you must have been playing the Bacchanal<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Playing the Bacchanal</lemma>:  "Bacchanal exercuisse." "To keep the festival of Bacchus," where frantic conduct and acts of outrageous madness were prevalent. See the Notes to the First Act of the Bacchidea.</note>, old gentleman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Inasmuch as you take me to be your slave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What? I--take you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Plague upon you! I know no master but Amphitryon.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. Have I lost my form? It's strange that Sosia shouldn't know me. I'll make trial. <stage>Calling out</stage>. How now! Tell me who I appear to be? Am I not really Amphitryon?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Amphitryon? Are you in your senses? Has it not been told you before, old fellow, that you have been playing the Bacchanal, to be asking another person who you are? Get away, I recommend you, don't be troublesome while Amphitryon, who has just come back from the enemy, is indulging himself with the company of his wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What wife? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Alcmena.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What man? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> How often do you want it told? Amphitryon, my master;--don't be troublesome.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Who's he sleeping with? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Take care that you don't meet with some mishap in trifling with me this way.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Prithee, do tell me, my dear Sosia.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> More civilly said--with Alcmena.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> In the same chamber?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Yes, as I fancy, he is sleeping with her side by side.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Alas!--wretch that I am!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>. It really is a gain which he imagines to be a misfortune. For to lend one's wife to another is just as though you were to let out barren land to be ploughed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Sosia! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> What, the plague, about Sosia?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Don't you know me, you whip-scoundrel?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> I know that you are a troublesome fellow, who have no need to go buy<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">No need to go buy</lemma>:  He seems to mean that a "litigium," or "lawsuit," is already prepared for him, in daring to personate Amphitryon.</note> a lawsuit. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Still once more--am I not your master Amphitryon?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> You are Bacchus himself<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Bacchus himself</lemma>:  He means that, from his frantic conduct he must surely be, not a Bacchanalian, but Bacchus himself.</note>, and not Amphitryon. How often do you want to be told? Any times more? My master Amphitryon, in the same chamber, is holding Alcmena in his embraces. If you persist, I'll produce him here, and not without your great discomfiture.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I wish him to be fetched. <stage>Aside.</stage> I pray that this day, in return for my services, I may not lose house, wife, and household, together with my figure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MERCURY</speaker><p> Well, I'll fetch him; but, in the meantime, do you mind about the door, please. <stage>Aside.</stage> I suppose that by this he has brought the sacrifice that he was intending, as far as the banquet<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">As the banquet</lemma>:  It is supposed that he here has a double meaning, and implies that he supposes that by this time Jupiter has satisfied his venement desire. It has been previously remarked, that after sacrifices a feast was made of the portions that were left.</note>. <stage>Aloud.</stage> If you are troublesome, you shan't escape without my making a sacrifice of you. <stage>He retires into the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Ye Gods, by my trust in you, what madness is distracting my household? What wondrous things have I seen since I arrived from abroad! Why, it's true, surely, what was once heard tell of, how that men of Attica were transformed in Arcadia<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In Arcadia</lemma>:  He alludes to a story among the ancients, that certain people of Arcadia were transformed for a certain time into wolves: they were called "Lycanthropi," or "Wolf-men." Pliny the Elder mentions them in his Eighth Book.</note>, and remained as savage wild beasts, and were not ever afterwards known unto their parents.

<stage>Enter BLEPHARO and SOSIA, at a distance.</stage>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> What's this, Sosia? Great marvels are these that you are telling of. Do you say that you found another Sosia at home exactly like yourself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I do say so--but, hark you, since I have produced a Sosia, Amphitryon an Amphitryon, how do you know whether you, perchance, may not be producing another Blepharo? O that the Gods would grant that you as well, belaboured with fists, and with your teeth knocked out, going without your breakfast, might credit this. ForI, that other Sosia, that is to say, who am yonder, has mauled me in a dreadful manner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Really, it is wonderful; but it's as well to mend our pace; for, as I perceive, Amphitryon is waiting for us, and my empty stomach is grumbling.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>.----And why do I mention foreign legends? More wondrous things they relate to have happened among our Theban race<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Our Theban race</lemma>:  He alludes to the story of Cadmus being sent by Agenor in search of Europa, and sowing the Dragon's teeth, from which arose a crop of armed men. See the Metamorphoses of Ovid, B. 3, l. 32.</note> in former days; that mighty searcher for Europa, attacking the monster sprung from Mars, suddenly produced his enemies from the serpent-seed; and in that battle fought, brother pressed on brother with lance and helm; the Epirote land, too, beheld the author of our race, together with the daughter of Venus<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With the daughter of Venus</lemma>:  He alludes to the tradition which stated that Cadmus and his wife Hermione retired to Illyria, and were there changed into serpents. See the Metamorphoses B. 4, l. 574.</note>, gliding as serpents. From on high supreme Jove thus willed it; thus destiny directs. All the noblest of our country, in return for their bright achievements, are pursued with direful woes. This fatality is pressing hard on me--still I could endure disasters so great, and submit to woes hardly to be endured----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Blepharo. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I don't know; I suspect something wrong.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Why? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Look, please, our master, like an humble courtier<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">An humble courtier</lemma>:  "Salutator." The "salutatores" were a class of men who in the later times of the Roman Republic obtained a living by visiting the houses of the wealthy in the morning, and hanging about the door to pay their respects, and to accompany the master when he went abroad. Many persons thus supported themselves, and thereby enacted a part not much unlike the Parasites among the Greeks.</note>, is walking before the door bolted fast.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> It's nothing; walking to and fro, he's looking for an appetite<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Looking for an appetite</lemma>:  Cicero relates that Socrates used to walk very briskly in the evening, and when asked why he did so, replied that he was going to market for an appetite.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> After a singular fashion, indeed; for he has shut the door, that it mayn't escape out of the house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> You do go yelping on. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I go neither yelping on nor barking on; if you listen to me, observe him. I don't know why he's by himself alone; he's making some calculation, I suppose. I can hear from this spot what he says-- don't be in a hurry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. How much I fear lest the Gods should blot out the glory I have acquired in the conquest of the foe. In wondrous manner do I see the whole of my household in commotion. And then my wife, so full of viciousness, incontinence, and dishonor, kills me outright. But about the goblet, it is a singular thing; yet the seal was properly affixed. And what besides? She recounted to me the battles I had fought; Pterelas, too, besieged and bravely slain by my own hand, Aye, aye--now I know the trick; this was done by Sosia's contrivance, who as well has disgracefully presumed to-day to get before me on my arrival.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>to BLEPHARO</stage>. He's talking about me, and in terms that I had rather not. Prithee, don't let's accost this man until he has disclosed his wrath.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Just as you please. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. If it is granted me this day to lay hold of that whip-scoundrel, I'll show him what it is to deceive his master, and to assail me with threats and tricks.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Do you hear him? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> I hear him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> That implement <stage>pointing to AMPHITRYON'S walkingstick</stage> is a burden for my shoulder-blades. Let's accost the man, if you please. Do you know what is in the habit of being commonly said?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> What you are going to say, I don't know; what you'll have to endure I pretty well guess.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> It's an old adage--"Hunger and delay summon anger to the nostrils<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the nostrils</lemma>:  From their expanding when a person is enraged, the nostrils were said to be peculiarly the seat of anger.</note>."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Aye, and well suited to the occasion. Let's address him directly--Amphitryon!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>looking round</stage>. Is it Blepharo I hear? It's strange why he's come to me. Still, he presents himself opportunely, for me to prove the guilty conduct of my wife. Why have you come here to me, Blepharo?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Have you so soon forgotten how early in the morning you sent Sosia to the ship, that I might take a repast with you to-day?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Never in this world was it done. But where is that scoundrel?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BELPH.</speaker><p> Who? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Sosia.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> See, there he is. <stage>Points at him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>looking about</stage>. Where? BLEPH. Before your eyes; don't you see him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I can hardly see for anger, so distracted has that fellow made me this day. You shall never escape my making a sacrifice of you. <stage>Offers to strike SOSIA, on which BLEPHARO prevents him.</stage> Do let me, Blepharo.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Listen, I pray. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Say on, I'm listening-- <stage>gives a blow to SOSIA</stage> you take that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> For what reason? Am I not in good time? I couldn't have gone quicker, if I had betaken myself on the oar-like wings<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Oar-like wings</lemma>:  "Remigiis." Virgil, and Ovid also, with considerable propriety, call the wings of D&aelig;dalus "remigia," "tiers of oars," from the resemblance which the main feathers of the wing bear to a row of oars. The story of D&aelig;dalus and Icarus is beautifully told by Ovid, in the Art of Love Book 2, and in the Metamorphoses, Book 8.</note> of D&aelig;dalus. <stage>AMPHITRYON tries to strike him again.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Prithee, do leave him alone; we couldn't quicken our pace any further.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Whether it was the pace of a man on stilts or that of the tortoise, I'm determined to be the death of this villain. <stage>Striking him at each sentence.</stage> Take that for the roof; that for the tiles; that for closing the door; that for making fun of your master; that for your abusive language.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> What injury has he been doing to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Do you ask? Shut out of doors, from that housetop <stage>pointing to it</stage> he has driven me away from my house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What, I? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What did you threaten that you would do if I knocked at that door? Do you deny it, you scoundrel?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Why shouldn't I deny it? See, he's sufficiently a witness with whom I have just now come; I was sent on purpose that by your invitation I might bring him to your house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Who sent you, villain? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> He who asks me the question.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> When, of all things?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Some little time since-not long since--just now. When you were reconciled at home to your wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Bacchus must have demented you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> May I not be paying my respects to Bacchus this day, nor yet to Ceres<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Nor yet to Ceres</lemma>:  He wishes to see neither of these Deities, it being a common notion that those to whom they appeared became mad.</note>. You ordered the vessels to be made clean, that you might perform a sacrifice, and you sent me to fetch him <stage>pointing to BLEPHARO</stage>, that he might breakfast with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Blepharo, may I perish outright if I have either been in the house, or if I have sent him. <stage>To SOSIA.</stage> Tell me--where did you leave me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> At home, with your wife Alcmena. Leaving you, I flew towards the harbour, and invited him in your name. We are come, and I've not seen you since till now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Villanous fellow! With my wife, say you? You shall never go away without getting a beating. <stage>Gives him a blow.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> <stage>crying out</stage>. Blepharo! BLEPH. Amphitryon, do let him alone, for my sake, and listen to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Well then, I'll let him alone. What do you want? Say on.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> He has just now been telling me most extraordi nary marvels. A juggler, or a sorcerer, perhaps, has enchanted all this household of yours. Do enquire in other quarters, and examine how it is. And don't cause this poor fellow to be tortured, before you understand the matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You give good advice; let's go in, I want you also to be my advocate against my wife. <stage>Knocks at the door.</stage>

<note anchored="yes">Many of those Commentators who have doubted the genuineness of the last Scene, and of the previous one from the fourteenth line, have been ready to admit that this Scene is the composition of Plautus indeed, it bears very strong internal marks of having been composed by him.</note>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> Who with such weighty blows has been shaking this door on all the hinges? Who has been making such a great disturbance for this long while before the house? If I find him out, I'll sacrifice him to the shades of the Teleboans. There's nothing, as the common saying is, that goes on well with me to-day. I left Blepharo and Sosia that I might find my kinsman Naucrates; him I have not found, and them I have lost. But I espy them; I'll go meet them, to enquire if they have any news.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Blepharo, that's our master that's coming out of the house; but this man's the sorcerer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> O Jupiter! What do I behold? This is not, but that is, Amphitryon; if this is, why really that cannot be he, unless, indeed, he is double.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> Are you calling this fellow Amphitryon?</p></sp>

I am that same Amphitryon, the descendant of<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Descendant of</lemma>:  "Nepos" cannot here mean "grandson," as Gorgophone was not a lineal ancestor of Amphitryon, being the sister of his father Alc&aelig;us.</note> Gorgophone, the general of the Thebans, and the sole combatant for Creon against the Teleboans; I, who have subdued by my might the Acarnanians and the Taphians, and, by my consummate warlike prowess, their king.

<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> I am he who by warfare and my valour crushed the hostile ravagers. They had destroyed Electryon and the brothers of my wife.

<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Immortal Gods! I cannot trust my own self, so exactly does he relate all the things that happened there. Consider, Blepharo.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> One thing only remains; if so it is, do you be Amphitryons both of you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> I knew what you would say. The scar that I have on the muscle of my right arm, from the wound which Pterelas gave me----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Well, that. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Quite to the purpose.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> See you! look, behold!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Uncover, and I'll look.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> We have uncovered. Look! <stage>They show their naked arms.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> <stage>looking at the right arm of each</stage>. Supreme Jupiter, what do I behold? On the right-arm muscle of each, in the same spot, the scar clearly appears with the same mark, reddish and somewhat livid, just as it has first commenced to close.

<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Do you settle these matters between yourselves; I'm off, for I have business; and I do not think that I have ever anywhere beheld such extraordinary wonders.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Blepharo, I pray that you'll stay as my advocate, and not go away.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BLEPHARO</speaker><p> Farewell. What need is there of me for an advocate, who don't know which of the two to side with?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> I'm going hence in-doors: Alcmena is in labour. <stage>Exit BLEPHARO, and JUPITER goes into AMPHITRYON'S house.</stage></p></sp>

I'm undone, wretch that I am; <milestone n="1040" unit="TLN line"/>for what am I to do, when my advocates and friends are now forsaking me? Never, by heavens, shall he deride me unrevenged, whoever he is. Now will I betake myself straight to the king, and tell him of the matter as it has happened. By my faith, I will this day take vengeance on this Thessalian sorcerer, who has wrongfully distracted the minds of my household. But where is he? <stage>Looking around.</stage> By my troth, he's off into the house, to my wife, I suppose. What other person lives in Thebes more wretched than myself? What now shall I do? I, whom all men deny and deride just as they please. I am resolved; I'll burst into the house; there, whatever person I perceive, whether maid-servant or man-servant, whether wife or whether paramour, <milestone n="1050" unit="TLN line"/>whether father or whether grandfather, I'll behead that person in the house; neither Jupiter nor all the Deities shall hinder me from this, even if they would, but that I'll do just as I have resolved. <stage>As he advances to the door, it thunders, and he falls in a swoon upon the ground.</stage>

<stage>Enter BROMIA, from the house, AMPHITRYON lying on the ground.</stage>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> <stage>to herself</stage>. The hopes and resources of my life lie buried in my breast, nor is there any boldness in my heart, but what I have lost it. So much to me do all things seem, the sea, the earth, the heavens, to be conspiring, that now I may be crushed, that I may be destroyed. Ah, wretched me! I know not what to do. Prodigies so great have come to pass within the house. Ah! woe is me! I'm sick at heart, some water I could wish! I'm overpowered and I'm utterly undone. My head is aching, and I cannot hear, nor do I see well with my eyes No woman is there more wretched than myself, nor can one seem to be more so. Thus has it this day befallen my mistress; for when she invoked for herself the Deities of travail, what rumblings and grumblings<milestone n="1062" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Rumblings and grumblings</lemma>:  "Strepitus, crepitus, somtus tonitrus." A iingle in evidently intended here.</note>, crashes and flashes; suddenly, how instantaneously did it thunder, and how woundy loud. On the spot where each one stood, at the peal he fell; then some one, I know not who, exclaimed in a mighty voice, "Alcmena, succour is at hand, fear not: propitious both to thee and thine, the Ruler of the Heavens comes. Arise," it said, "ye who have fallen down in your terror through dread of me." As I lay, I arose; I fancied that the house was in flames. Then Alcmena called me; and then did that circumstance strike me with horror. Fears for my mistress took possession of me; I ran to her to enquire what she wanted; and then I beheld that she had given birth to two male children; not yet did any one of us perceive when she was delivered, or indeed expect it. <stage>Sees AMPHITRYON.</stage> But what's this? Who's this old man that's lying thus before our house? Has Jupiter then smitten him with his thunders? By my troth, I think so; for, oh Jupiter! he is in a lethargy just like one dead. I'll approach, that I may learn who it is. <stage>She advances.</stage> Surely, this is my master Amphitryon. <stage>Calls aloud.</stage> Ho! Amphitryon!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I'm dead. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Arise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I'm slain outright.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Give me your hand. <stage>Takes his hand.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>recovering</stage>. Who is it that has hold of me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Bromia, your maid-servant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> <stage>rising</stage>. I tremble all over, to such a degree has Jove pealed against me. And no otherwise is it than if I had come hither from Acheron. But why have you come out of the house?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> The same alarm has scared ourselves, affrighted with horror; in the house where you yourself dwell, have I seen astounding prodigies. Woe to me, Amphitryon; even now do my senses fail me to such a degree.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Come now, tell me; do you know me to be your master Amphitryon? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> I do know it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Look even once again. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> I do know it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> She alone of all my household has a sane mind.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Nay but, really, they are all of them sane.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> But my wife causes me to be insane by her own shameful practices.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> But I'll make you, Amphitryon, to be holding other language; that you may understand that your wife is dutiful and chaste, upon that subject I will in a few words discover some tokens and some proofs. In the first place of all, Alcmena has given birth to two sons.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Two, say you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Two.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> The Gods preserve me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Allow me to speak, that you may know that all the Deities are propitious to yourself and to your wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Say on. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> After that, this day, your wife began to be in labour, when the pangs of childbirth came on, as is the custom with women in travail, she invoked the immortal Gods to give her aid, with washed hands<milestone n="1094" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With washed hands</lemma>:  The head was covered and the hands made pure by washing, before sacrifice to the Gods.</note> and with covered head. Then forthwith it thundered with most tremendous crash. At first we thought that your house was falling; all your house shone bright, as though it had been made of gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Prithee, relieve me quickly from this, since you have kept me long enough in suspense. What happened then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> While these things were passing, meanwhile, not one of us heard your wife groaning or complaining; and thus, in fact, without pain was she delivered.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Then do I rejoice at this, whatever she has merited at my hands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Leave that alone, and hear these things which I shall tell you. After she was delivered, she bade us wash the babes; we commenced to do so. But that child which I washed, how stout, how very powerful he is; and not a person was there, able to wrap him in the swaddling-clothes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Most wondrous things you tell of. If these things are true, I do not apprehend but that succour has been brought to my wife from heaven.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Now shall I make you own to things more wondrous still. After he was laid in the cradle, two immense crested serpents glided down through the skylight; instantly they both reared their heads.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> Ah me! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Be not dismayed--but the serpents began to gaze upon all around. After they beheld the children, quickly they made towards the cradle; I, fearing for the children, alarmed for myself, going backwards, began to draw and pull the cradle to and fro, and so much the more fiercely did the serpents pursue. After that one of the children caught sight of the serpents, he quickly leapt from the cradle, straightway he made an attack upon them, ana suddenly he grasped them, one in each hand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> You tell of wondrous things; a very fearful exploit do you relate; for at your words horror steals upon the limbs of wretched me. What happened then? Say on.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BBOM.</speaker><p> The child slew both the serpents. While these things are passing, in a loud voice there calls upon your wife----
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> What person----? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BROMIA</speaker><p> Jupiter, the supreme Ruler of Gods and men. He said that he had secretly enjoyed Alcmena in his embraces, and that he was his own son who had overcome those serpents; the other, he said, was your child.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> By my troth, I am not sorry if I am allowed to take my half of a blessing in partnership with Jupiter. Go home, and bid the sacred vessels to be at once prepared for me, that with many victims I may seek my peace with supreme Jove. I will apply to Tiresias<milestone n="1128" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Tiresias</lemma>:  Some Commentators think that under the name Tiresias any soothsayer is here meant, and that this was before the time of Tiresias. So involved is the heathen Mythology, that it would be hard to say who existed first, Tiresias or Amphitryon, so that if Plautus is guilty of an anachronism, it is one of his most excusable ones. Juno was said to have struck Tiresias with blindness; on which Jupiter, as a recompense, bestowed on him the gift of prophecy See the Metamorphoses of Ovid, B. 3, l. 323.</note> the soothsayer, and consult him what he considers ought to be done; at the same time I'll relate to him this matter just as it has happened. <stage>It thunders.</stage> But what means this? How dreadfully it thunders! Ye Gods, your mercy, I do entreat.</p></sp></div2>

<stage>JUPITER appears, in his own character, above.</stage>
<sp><speaker>JUPITER</speaker><p> Be of good cheer, Amphitryon; I am come to thy aid: thou hast nothing to fear; all diviners and soothsayers let alone. What is to be, and what has past, I will tell thee; and so much better than they can, inasmuch as I am Jupiter. First of all, I have made loan of the person of Alcmena, and have caused her to be pregnant with a son. Thou, too, didst cause her to be pregnant, when thou didst set out upon the expedition; at one birth has she brought forth the two together. One of these, the one that is sprung from my parentage, shall bless thee<milestone n="1140" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Shall bless thee</lemma>:  "Te adficiet." "Se," "himself," is thought by some to be the correct reading here, as it has been remarked, how could the exploits of Hercules redound to the glory of Amphitryon? Still, as his adoptive father, it was not unlikely that he would take a peculiar interest in the achievements of Hercules.</note> with deathless glory by his deeds. Do thou return with Alcmena to your former affection; she merits not that thou shouldst impute it to her as her blame; by my power has she been compelled thus to act. I now return to the heavens. <stage>He ascends.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPH.</speaker><p> I'll do as thou dost command me; and I entreat thee to keep thy promises. I'll go in-doors to my wife. I dismiss the aged Tiresias from my thoughts.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>An ACTOR.</speaker>
<p>Spectators, now, for the sake of supreme Jove<milestone n="1146" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Sake of supreme Jove</lemma>:  According to some Commentators, the Romans believed that this Play greatly redounded to the honor of Jupiter; and it was, consequently, often acted in times of public trouble and calamity, with the view of appeasing his anger. They must have had singular notions of honor, as his Godship figures here in the combined characters of an insolent impostor and an unprincipled debauchee.</note>, give loud applause.
