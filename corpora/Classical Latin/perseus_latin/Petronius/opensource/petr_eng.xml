            <p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>"Are our rhetoricians tormented by a new tribe of
                Furies when they cry: 'These scars I earned in the struggle for popular rights; I
                sacrificed this eye for you: where is a guiding hand to lead me to my children? My
                knees are hamstrung, and cannot support my body'? Though indeed even these speeches
                might be endured if they smoothed the path of aspirants to oratory. But as it is,
                the sole result of this bombastic matter and these loud empty phrases is that a
                pupil who steps into a court thinks that he has been carried into another world. I
                believe that college makes complete fools of our young men, because they see and
                hear nothing of ordinary life there. It is pirates standing in chainson the beach,
                tyrants pen in hand ordering sons to cut off their fathers' heads, oracles in time
                of pestilence demanding the blood of three virgins or more, honey-balls of phrases,
                every word and act besprinkled with poppy-seed and sesame.<milestone unit="section"
                    n="2"/>People who are fed on this diet can no more be sensible than people who
                live in the kitchen can be savoury. With your permission I must tell you the truth,
                that you teachers more than anyone have been the ruin of true eloquence. Your
                tripping, empty tones stimulate certain absurd effects into being, with the result
                that the substance of your speech languishes and dies. In the age: when Sophocles or
                Euripides found the inevitable word for their verse, young men were not yet being
                confined to set speeches. When Pindar and the nine lyric poets were too modest to
                use Homer's lines, no cloistered<pb id="p.5"/> pedant had yet ruined young men's
                brains. I need not go to the poets for evidence. I certainly do not find that Plato
                or Demosthenes took any course of training of this kind. Great style, which, if I
                may say so, is also modest style, is never blotchy and bloated. It rises supreme by
                virtue of its natural beauty. Your flatulent and formless flow of words is a modern
                immigrant from Asia to Athens. Its breath fell upon the mind of ambitious youth like
                the influence of a baleful planet, and when the old tradition was once broken,
                eloquence halted and grew dumb. In a word, who after this came to equal the
                splendour of Thucydides or Hyperides? Even poetry did not glow with the colour of
                health, but the whole of art, nourished on one universal diet, lacked the vigour to
                reach the grey hairs of old age. The decadence in painting was the same, as soon as
                Egyptian charlatans had found a short cut to this high calling."</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Agamemnon<note>A teacher of rhetoric. Encolpius and
                    Ascyltus were invited to Trimalchio's dinner as Agamemnon's pupils.</note> would
                not allow me to stand declaiming out in the colonnade longer than he had spent
                sweating inside the school. <quote>Your talk has an uncommon flavour, young
                man,</quote> he said, "and what is most unusual, you appreciate good sense. I will
                not therefore deceive you by making a mystery of my art. The fact is that the
                teachers are not to blame for these exhibitions. They are in a madhouse, and they
                must gibber. Unless they speak to the taste of their young masters they will be left
                alone in the colleges, as Cicero remarks.<note>See <hi rend="italics">Pro
                    Caelio,</hi> 17, 41.</note> Like the toadies [of Comedy] cadging after the rich
                man's dinners, they think first about what is calculated<pb id="p.7"/> to please
                their audience. They will never gain their object unless they lay traps for the ear.
                A master of oratory is like a fisherman; he must put the particular bait on his hook
                which he knows will tempt the little fish, or he may sit waiting on his rock with no
                hope of a catch. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then what is to be done? It is the
                parents who should be attacked for refusing to allow their children to profit by
                stern discipline. To begin with they consecrate even their young hopefuls, like
                everything else, to ambition. Then if they are in; a hurry for the fulfilment of
                their vows, they drive the unripe schoolboy into the law courts, and thrust
                eloquence, the noblest of callings, upon children who are still struggling into the
                world. If they would allow work to go on step by step, so that bookish boys were
                steeped in diligent reading, their minds formed by wise sayings, their pens
                relentless in tracking down the right word, their ears giving a long hearing to
                pieces they wished to imitate, and if they would convince themselves that what took
                a boy's fancy was never fine; then the grand old style of oratory would have its
                full force and splendour. As it is, the boy wastes his time at school, and the young
                man is a laughing-stock in the courts. Worse than that, they will not admit when
                they are old the errors they have once imbibed at school. But pray do not think that
                I impugn Lucilius's rhyme<note>The allusion is not known.</note> about modesty. I
                will myself put my own views in a poem:</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>If any man seeks for success in stern art and
                applies his mind to great tasks, let him first perfect his character by the rigid
                law of frugality. Nor must he care for the lofty frown of the tyrant's palace, or
                scheme for suppers with prodigals like a client, or drown the fires of his wit with
                wine in the company<pb id="p.9"/> of the wicked, or sit before the stage applauding
                an actor's grimaces for a price.</p>
            <p>
                <quote>But whether the fortress of armoured Tritonis smiles upon him, or the land
                    where the Spartan farmer lives, or the home of the Sirens, let him give the
                    years of youth to poetry, and let his fortunate soul drink of the Maeonian
                    fount. Later, when he is full of the learning of the Socratic school, let him
                    loose the reins, and shake the weapons of mighty Demosthenes like a free man.
                    Then let the company of Roman writers pour about him, and, newly unburdened from
                    the music of Greece, steep his soul and transform his taste. Meanwhile, let him
                    withdraw from the courts and suffer his pages to run free, and in secret make
                    ringing strains in swift rhythm; then let him proudly tell tales of feasts, and
                    wars recorded in fierce chant, and lofty words such as undaunted Cicero uttered.
                    Gird up thy soul for these noble ends; so shalt thou be fully inspired, and
                    shalt pour out words in swelling torrent from a heart the Muses love.</quote>
            </p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>I was listening to him so carefully that I did not
                notice Ascyltos slipping away. I was pacing the gardens in the heat of our
                conversation, when a great crowd of students came out into the porch, apparently
                from some master whose extemporary harangue had followed Agamemnon's
                    discourse.<note>A declamation on a given deliberative theme (<hi rend="italics">suasoria</hi>), which the teacher delivered as an example to his
                pupils.</note> So while the young men were laughing at his epigrams, and denouncing
                the tendency of his style as a whole, I took occasion to steal away and began
                hurriedly to look for Ascyltos. But I did not remember the road accurately, and I
                did not know where our lodgings were. So wherever I went, I kept coming back to<pb
                    id="p.11"/> the same spot, till I was tired out with walking, and dripping with
                    sweat.<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At last I went up to an old woman who
                was selling country vegetables and said,<quote>Please, mother, do you happen to know
                    where I live?</quote> She was charmed with such a polite fool.<quote>Of course I
                    do,</quote> she said, and got up and began to lead the way. I thought her a
                prophetess . . . ., and when we had got into an obscure quarter the obliging old
                lady pushed back a patchwork curtain and said,<quote>This should be your
                house.</quote> I was saying that I did not remember it, when I noticed some men and
                naked women walking cautiously about among placards of price. Too late, too late I
                realized that I had been taken into a bawdy-house. I cursed the cunning old woman,
                and covered my head, and began to run through the brothel to another part, when just
                at the entrance Ascyltos met me, as tired as I was, and half-dead. It looked as
                though the same old lady had brought him there. I hailed him with a laugh, and asked
                him what he was doing in such an unpleasant spot.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
                He mopped himself with his hands and said, <quote>If you only knew what has happened
                    to me.</quote>
                <quote>What is it?</quote> I said. <quote>Well,</quote> he said, on the point of
                fainting, <quote>I was wandering all over the town without finding where I had left
                    my lodgings, when a respectable person came up to me and very kindly offered to
                    direct me. He took me round a number of dark turnings and brought me out here,
                    and then began to offer me money and solicit me. A woman got threepence out of
                    me for a room, and he had already seized me. The worst would have happened if I
                    had not been stronger than he.</quote> . . .</p>
            <p>Every one in the place seemed to be drunk on aphrodisiacs . . . but our united forces
                defied our assailant. . . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>I dimly saw Giton standing on the kerb of the
                    road<pb id="p.13"/> in the dark, and hurried towards him. . . . I was asking my
                brother whether he had got ready anything for us to eat, when the boy sat down at
                the head of the bed, and began to cry and rub away the tears with his thumb. My
                brother's looks made me uneasy, and I asked what had happened. The boy was unwilling
                to tell, but I added threats to entreaties, and at last he said, <quote>That brother
                    or friend of yours ran into our lodgings a little while ago and began to offer
                    me violence. I shouted out, and he drew his sword and said, 'If you are a
                    Lucretia, you have found your Tarquin.'</quote></p>
            <p>When I heard this I shook my fist in Ascyltos's face. <quote>What have you to
                say?</quote> I cried, <quote>You dirty fellow whose very breath is unclean?</quote>
                Ascyltos first pretended to be shocked, and then made a great show of fight, and
                roared out much more loudly: <quote>Hold your tongue, you filthy prizefighter. You
                    were kicked out of the ring in disgrace. Be quiet, Jack Stab-inthe-dark. You
                    never could face a clean woman in your best days. I was the same kind of brother
                    to you in the garden, as this boy is now in the lodgings.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><quote>You sneaked away from the master's
                talk,</quote> I said.<quote>Well, you fool, what do you expect? I was perishing of
                    hunger. Was I to go on listening to his views, all broken bottles and
                    interpretation of dreams? By God, you are far worse than I am, flattering a poet
                    to get asked out to dinner.</quote></p>
            <p>Then our sordid quarrelling ended in a shout of laughter, and we retired afterwards
                more peaceably for what remained to be done. . . .</p>
            <p>But his insult came into my head again. <quote>Ascyltos,</quote> I said, <quote>I am
                    sure we cannot agree. We will<pb id="p.15"/> divide our luggage, and try to
                    defeat our poverty by our own earnings. You are a scholar, and so am I. Besides,
                    I will promise not to stand in the way of your success. Otherwise twenty things
                    a day will bring us into opposition, and spread scandal about us all over the
                    town.</quote> Ascyltos acquiesced, and said, <quote>But as we are engaged to
                    supper to-night like a couple of students, do not let us waste the evening. I
                    shall be pleased to look out for new lodgings and a new brother to-morrow?</quote>
                <quote>Waiting for one's pleasures is weary work,</quote> I replied. . . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>I went sight-seeing all over the town and then came
                back to the little room. At last I could ask for kisses openly. I hugged the boy
                close in my arms and had my fill of a happiness that might be envied. All was not
                over when Ascyltos came sneaking up to the door, shook back the bars by force, and
                found me at play with my brother. He filled the room with laughter and applause,
                pulled me out of the cloak I had over me, and said, <quote>What are you at, my
                    pureminded brother, you that would break up our partnership?</quote> Not content
                with gibing, he pulled the strap off his bag, and began to give me a regular
                flogging, saying sarcastically as he did so: <quote>Don't make this kind of bargain
                    with your brother.</quote> . . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>It was already dusk when we came into the market.
                We saw a quantity of things for sale, of no great value, though the twilight very
                easily cast a veil over their shaky reputations. So for our part we stole a cloak
                and carried it off, and seized the opportunity of displaying the extreme edge of it
                in one corner of<pb id="p.17"/> the market, hoping that the bright colour might
                attract a purchaser. In a little while a countryman, whom I knew by sight, came up
                with a girl, and began to examine the cloak narrowly. Ascyltos in turn cast a glance
                at the shoulders of our country customer,<note>The rustic was carrying a shirt (<hi
                        rend="italics">tunica</hi>) hung over his shoulders.</note> and was suddenly
                struck dumb with astonishment. I could not look upon the man myself without a stir,
                for he was the person, I thought, who had found the shirt in the lonely spot where
                we lost it. He was certainly the very man. But as Ascyltos was afraid to trust his
                eyes for fear of doing something rash, he first came up close as if he were a
                purchaser, and pulled the shirt off the countryman's shoulders, and then felt it
                    carefully.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> By a wonderful stroke of luck the
                countryman had never laid his meddling hands on the seam, and he was offering the
                thing for sale with a condescending air as a beggar's leavings. When Ascyltos saw
                that our savings were untouched, and what a poor creature the seller was, he took me
                a little aside from the crowd, and said, <quote>Do you know, brother, the treasure I
                    was grumbling at losing has come back to us. That is the shirt, and I believe it
                    is still full of gold pieces: they have never been touched. What shall we do?
                    How shall we assert our legal rights?</quote></p>
            <p>I was delighted, not only because I saw a chance of profit, but because fortune had
                relieved me of a very disagreeable suspicion. I was against any roundabout methods.
                I thought we should proceed openly by civil process, and obtain a decision in the
                courts if they refused to give up other people's property to the rightful owners.</p>
            <pb id="p.19"/>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But Ascyltos was afraid of the law: <quote>Nobody
                    knows us in this place,</quote> he said, "and nobody will believe what we say, I
                should certainly like to buy the thing, although it is ours and we know it. It is
                better to get back our savings cheaply than to embark upon the perils of a lawsuit:</p>
            <p>
                <quote>Of what avail are laws where money rules alone, and the poor suitor can never
                    succeed? The very men who mock at the times by carrying the Cynic's scrip have

                    more than a public auction, and the knightly juror who sits listening to the
                    case gives his vote as he is paid.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>But we had nothing in hand except one sixpence,<note>Literally, a coin worth 2
                asses.</note> with which we had meant to buy pease and lupines. And so for fear our
                prize should escape us, we decided to sell the cloak cheaper than we had intended,
                and so to incur a slight loss for a greater gain. We had just unrolled our piece,
                when a veiled woman, who was standing by the countryman, looked carefully at the
                marks, and then seized the cloak with both hands, shouting at the top of her voice,
                    <quote>Thieves!</quote> We were terrified, but rather than do nothing, we began
                to tug at the dirty torn shirt, and cried out with equal bitterness that these
                people had taken some spoil that was ours. But the dispute was in no way even, and
                the dealers who were attracted by the noise of course laughed at our indignation,
                since one side was laying claim to an expensive cloak, the other to a set of rags<pb
                    id="p.21"/> which would not serve to make a decent patchwork.<milestone
                    unit="section" n="15"/> Ascyltos now cleverly stopped their laughter by calling
                for silence and saying, <quote>Well, you see, every one has an affection for his own
                    things. If they will give us our shirt, they shall have their cloak.</quote> The
                countryman and the woman were satisfied with this exchange, but by this time some
                policemen had been called in to punish us; they wanted to make a profit out of the
                cloak, and tried to persuade us to leave the disputed property with them and let a
                judge look into our complaints the next day. They urged that besides the
                counter-claims to these garments, a far graver question arose, since each party must
                lie under suspicion of thieving. It was suggested that trustees should be appointed,
                and one of the traders, a bald man with a spotty forehead, who used sometimes to do
                law work, laid hands on the cloak and declared that he would produce it to-morrow.
                But clearly the object was that the cloak should be deposited with a pack of thieves
                and be seen no more, in the hope that we should not keep our appointment, for fear
                of being charged.</p>
            <p>It was obvious that our wishes coincided with his, and chance came to support the
                wishes of both sides. The countryman lost his temper when we said his rags must be
                shown in public, threw the shirt in Ascyltos's face, and asked us, now that we had
                no grievance, to give up the cloak which had raised the whole quarrel. . . .</p>
            <p>We thought we had got back our savings. We hurried away to the inn and shut the door,
                and then had a laugh at the wits of our false accusers and at the dealers too, whose
                mighty sharpness had returned our money to us. <quote>I never want to grasp what I
                    desire at once, nor do easy victories delight me.</quote></p>

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Thanks to Giton, we found supper ready, and we were
                making a hearty meal, when a timid knock sounded at the door.</p>
            <p>We turned pale and asked who it was. <quote>Open the door,</quote> said a voice,
                    <quote>and you will see.</quote> While we were speaking, the bar slipped and
                fell of its own accord, the door suddenly swung open, and let in our visitor. It was
                the veiled woman who had stood with the countryman a little while before. <quote>Did
                    you think you had deceived me?</quote> she said. <quote>I am Quartilla's maid.
                    You intruded upon her devotions before her secret chapel. Now she has come to
                    your lodgings, and begs for the favour of a word with you. Do not be uneasy; she
                    will not be angry, or punish you for a mistake. On the contrary, she wonders how
                    Heaven conveyed such polite young men to her quarter.</quote> We still said
                    nothing,<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> and showed no approval one way or the
                other. Then Quartilla herself came in with one girl by her, sat down on my bed, and
                cried for a long while. We did not put in a word even then, but sat waiting in
                amazement for the end of this carefully arranged exhibition of grief. When this very
                designing rain had ceased, she drew her proud head out of her cloak and wrung her
                hands together till the joints cracked. <quote>You bold creatures,</quote> she
                    said,<quote>where did you learn to outrival the robbers of romance? Heaven knows
                    I pity you. A man cannot look upon forbidden things and go free. Indeed the gods
                    walk abroad so commonly in our streets that it is easier to meet a god than a
                    man. Do not suppose that I have come here to avenge myself. I am more sorry for
                    your tender years than for my own wrongs. For I still believe that heedless
                    youth has led you into deadly sin. I lay tormenting myself that night and<pb
                        id="p.25"/> shivering with such a dreadful chill that I even fear an attack
                    of tertian ague. So I asked for a remedy in my dreams, and was told to find you
                    out and allay the raging of my disease by the clever plan you would show me. But
                    I am not so greatly concerned about a cure; deep in my heart burns a greater
                    grief, which drags me down to inevitable death. I am afraid that youthful
                    indiscretion will lead you to publish abroad what you saw in the chapel of
                    Priapus, and reveal our holy rites to the mob. So I kneel with folded hands
                    before you, and beg and pray you not to make a laughing-stock of our nocturnal
                    worship, not to deride the immemorial mystery to which less than a thousand
                    souls hold the key.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>She finished her prayer, and again cried bitterly,
                and buried her face and bosom in my bed, shaken all over with deep sobs. I was
                distracted with pity and terror together. I reassured her, telling her not to
                trouble herself about either point. No one would betray her devotions, and we would
                risk our lives to assist the will of Heaven, if the gods had showed her any further
                cure for her tertian ague. At this promise the woman grew more cheerful, kissed me
                again and again and gently stroked the long hair that fell about my ears, having
                passed from crying to laughter. <quote>I will sign a peace with you,</quote> she
                said, "and withdraw the suit I have entered against you. But if you had not promised
                me the cure I want, there was a whole regiment ready for tomorrow to wipe out my

                the little girl who had come in with Quartilla.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
                The whole place rang with farcical laughter, while we kept looking first at each

                said this, Ascyltos was struck dumb for a moment, while I turned colder than a Swiss
                winter, and could not utter a syllable. But the presence of my friends saved me from
                my worst fears. They were three weak women, if they wanted to make any attack on us.
                We had at least our manhood in our favour, if nothing else. And certainly our dress
                was more fit for action. Indeed I had already matched our forces in pairs. If it

                where three couches were laid and a whole rich dinner-service was finely spread out.
                We were asked to sit down, and after beginning with some wonderful hors d'oeuvres we
                swam in wine, and that too Falernian. We followed this with more courses, and were
                dropping off to sleep, when Quartilla said, <quote>Well, how can you think of going
                    to sleep, when you know that is your duty to devote the whole night to the

                was falling asleep, when the maid who had been driven away so rudely rubbed his face
                over with soot, and coloured his lips and his neck with vermilion while he drowsed.
                By this time I was tired out with adventures too, and had just taken the tiniest
                taste of sleep. All the servants, indoors and out, had done the same. Some lay
                anyhow by the feet of the guests, some leaned against the walls, some even stayed in
                the doorway with their heads together. The oil in the lamps had run out, and they
                gave a thin dying light. All at once two Syrians came in to rob the dining-room, and
                in quarrelling greedily over the plate pulled a large jug in two and broke it. The
                table fell over with the plate, and a cup which happened to fly<pb id="p.33"/> some
                distance hit the head of the maid, who was lolling over a seat. The knock made her
                scream, and this showed up the thieves and woke some of the drunken party. The
                Syrians who had come to steal dropped side by side on a sofa, when they realized
                that they were being noticed, with the most convincing naturalness, and began to
                snore like old-established sleepers.</p>
            <p>By this time the butler had got up and refilled the flickering lamps. The boys rubbed
                their eyes for a few minutes, and then came back to wait. Then a girl with cymbals

            <p>The third day had come. A good dinner was promised. But we were bruised and sore.
                Escape was better even than rest. We were making some melancholy plans for avoiding
                the coming storm, when one of Agamemnon's servants came up as we stood hesitating,
                and said, <quote>Do you not know at whose house it is today? Trimalchio, a very rich
                    man, who has a clock and a uniformed trumpeter in his dining-room, to keep
                    telling him how much of his life is lost and gone.</quote> We forgot our
                troubles and hurried into our clothes, and told Giton, who till now had been waiting
                on us very willingly, to follow us to the baths.<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
                We began to take a stroll in evening dress to pass the time, or rather to joke and
                mix with the groups of players, when all at once we saw a bald old man in a reddish
                shirt playing at ball with some long-haired boys. It was not the boys that attracted
                our notice, though they deserved it, but the old gentleman, who was in his
                house-shoes, busily engaged with a green ball. He never picked it up if it touched
                the ground. A slave stood by with a bagful and supplied them to the players. We also
                observed a new feature in the game. Two eunuchs were standing at different points in
                the group. One held a silver jordan, one counted the balls, not as they flew from
                hand to hand in the rigour of the game, but when they dropped to the ground. We were
                amazed at such a display, and then Menelaus<note>Agamemnon's assistant, who would
                    take junior classes in rhetoric. He is called <hi rend="italics">antescholanus,</hi> assistant tutor, in c. 81.</note> ran up and said,
                    <quote>This is the man who will give you places at his table: indeed what you
                    see is the overture to his dinner.</quote> Menelaus had just finished when<pb
                    id="p.41"/> Trimalchio cracked his fingers. One eunuch came up at this signal
                and held the jordan for him as he played. He relieved himself and called for a
                basin, dipped in his hands and wiped them on a boy's head.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>I cannot linger over details. We went into the
                bath. We stayed till we ran with sweat, and then at once passed through into the
                cold water. Trimalchio was now anointed all over and rubbed down, not with towels,
                but with blankets of the softest wool. Three masseurs sat there drinking Falernian
                wine under his eyes. They quarrelled and spilt a quantity. Trimalchio said they were
                drinking his health. Then he was rolled up in a scarlet woollen coat and put in a
                litter. Four runners decked with medals went before him, and a hand-cart on which
                his favourite rode. This was a wrinkled blear-eyed boy uglier than his master
                Trimalchio. As he was being driven off, a musician with a tiny pair of pipes
                arrived, and played the whole way as though he were whispering secrets in his ear.</p>
            <p>We followed, lost in wonder, and came with Agamemnon to the door. A notice was
                fastened on the doorpost: <quote>NO SLAVE TO GO OUT OF DOORS EXCEPT BY THE
                    MASTER'SORDERS. PENALTY, ONE HUNDRED STRIPES.</quote> Just at the entrance stood
                a porter in green clothes, with a cherry-coloured belt, shelling peas in a silver
                dish. A golden cage hung in the doorway, and a spotted magpie in it greeted
                    visitors.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/> I was gazing at all this, when I
                nearly fell backwards and broke my leg. For on the left hand as you went in, not far
                from the porter's office, a great dog on a chain was painted on the wall, and over
                him was written in large letters<quote>BEWARE OF THE DOG.</quote> My friends laughed
                at me, but I plucked up courage and went on to examine the whole wall. It had a
                picture of a slave-market<pb id="p.43"/> on it, with the persons' names. Trimalchio
                was there with long hair, holding a Mercury's staff.<note>Mercury, as the god of
                    business, was Trimalchio's patron, It was Mercury who secured Trimalchio's
                    selection to be a Sevir Augustalis, an official responsible for duly carrying
                    out the worship of the Emperor. One of the privileges of the Sevirs was to sit
                    on a throne.</note> Minerva had him by the hand and was leading him into Rome.
                Then the painstaking artist had given a faithful picture of his whole career with
                explanations: how he had learned to keep accounts, and how at last he had been made
                steward. At the point where the wall-space gave out, Mercury had taken him by the
                chin, and was whirling him up to his high official throne. Fortune stood by with her
                flowing horn of plenty, and the three Fates spinning their golden threads. I also
                observed a company of runners practising in the gallery under a trainer, and in a
                corner I saw a large cupboard containing a tiny shrine, wherein were silver
                house-gods, and a marble image of Venus, and a large golden box, where they told me
                Trimalchio's first beard was laid up.</p>
            <p>I began to ask the porter what pictures they had in the hall. <quote>The Iliad and
                    the Odyssey,</quote> he said,<quote>and the gladiator's show given by
                Laenas.</quote> I could not take them all in at once. . . . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/>We now went through to the dining-room. At the
                entrance the steward sat receiving accounts. I was particularly astonished to see
                rods and axes fixed on the door posts of the dining-room, and one part of them
                finished off with a kind of ship's beak, inscribed:</p>
            <pb id="p.45"/>
            <p><quote>PRESENTED BY CINNAMUS THE STEWARD TO CAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO, PRIEST OF THE
                    COLLEGE OF AUGUSTUS.</quote><note>Rods and axes were the symbols of office of
                    lictors, the attendants on Roman magistrates, and the Sevirs had the right to be
                    attended by lictors. See c. 65.</note> Under this inscription a double lamp hung
                from the ceiling, and two calendars were fixed on either doorpost, one having this
                entry, if I remember right: <quote>Our master C. is out to supper on December the
                    30th and 31st,</quote>the other being painted with the moon in her course, and
                the likenesses of the seven stars. Lucky and unlucky days were marked too with
                distinctive knobs.</p>
            <p>Fed full of these delights, we tried to get into the dining-room, when one of the
                slaves, who was entrusted with this duty, cried, <quote>Right foot first!</quote>
                For a moment we were naturally nervous, for fear any of us had broken the rule in
                crossing the threshold. But just as we were all taking a step with the right foot
                together, a slave stripped for flogging fell at our feet, and began to implore us to
                save him from punishment. It was no great sin which had put him in such peril; he
                had lost the steward's clothes in the bath, and the whole lot were scarcely worth
                ten sesterces. So we drew back our right feet, and begged the steward, who sat
                counting gold pieces in the hall, to let the slave off. He looked up haughtily, and
                    said,<quote>It is not the loss I mind so much as the villain's carelessness. He
                    lost my dinner dress, which one of my clients gave me on my birthday. It was
                    Tyrian dve, of course, but it had been washed once already. Well, well, I make
                    you a present of the fellow.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>We were obliged by his august kindness, and when<pb
                    id="p.47"/> we were in the dining-room, the slave for whom we had pleaded ran
                up, and to our astonishment rained kisses on us, and thanked us for our mercy.
                    <quote>One word,</quote> he said, <quote>you will know in a minute who owes you
                    a debt of gratitude: 'The master's wine is in the butler's gift.</quote> ' . . .
                .</p>
            <p>At last then we sat down, and boys from Alexandria poured water cooled with snow over
                our hands. Others followed and knelt down at our feet, and proceeded with great
                skill to pare our hangnails. Even this unpleasant duty did not silence them, but
                they kept singing at their work. I wanted to find out whether the whole household
                could sing, so I asked for a drink. A ready slave repeated my order in a chant not
                less shrill. They all did the same if they were asked to hand anything. It was more
                like an actor's dance than a gentleman's dining-room. But some rich and tasty whets
                for the appetite were brought on; for every one had now sat down except Trimalchio,
                who had the first place kept for him in the new style. A donkey in Corinthian bronze
                stood on the side-board, with panniers holding olives, white in one side, black in
                the other. Two dishes hid the donkey; Trimalchio's name and their weight in silver
                was engraved on their edges. There were also dormice rolled in honey and poppy-seed,
                and supported on little bridges soldered to the plate. Then there were hot sausages
                laid on a silver grill, and under the grill damsons and seeds of pomegranate.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/>While we were engaged with these delicacies,
                Trimalchio was conducted in to the sound of music, propped on the tiniest of
                pillows. A laugh escaped the unwary. His head was shaven and peered out of a scarlet
                cloak, and over the heavy clothes on his neck he had put on a<pb id="p.49"/> napkin
                with a broad stripe and fringes hanging from it all round. On the little finger of
                his left hand he had an enormous gilt ring, and on the top joint of the next finger
                a smaller ring which appeared to me to be entirely gold, but was really set all
                round with iron cut out in little stars. Not content with this display of wealth, he
                bared his right arm, where a golden bracelet shone, and an ivory bangle clasped with
                a plate of bright metal.<milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Then he said, as he
                picked his teeth with a silver quill, <quote>It was not convenient for me to come to
                    dinner yet, my friends, but I gave up all my own pleasure; I did not like to
                    stay away any longer and keep you waiting. But you will not mind if I finish my
                    game?</quote> A boy followed him with a table of terebinth wood and crystal
                pieces, and I noticed the prettiest thing possible. Instead of black and white
                counters they used gold and silver coins. Trimalchio kept passing every kind of
                remark as he played, and we were still busy with the hors d'oeuvres, when a tray was
                brought in with a basket on it, in which there was a hen made of wood, spreading out
                her wings as they do when they are sitting. The music grew loud: two slaves at once
                came up and began to hunt in the straw. Peahen's eggs were pulled out and handed to
                the guests. Trimalchio turned his head to look, and said,<quote>I gave orders, my
                    friends, that peahen's eggs should be put under a common hen. And upon my oath I
                    am afraid they are hard-set by now. But we will try whether they are still fresh
                    enough to suck.</quote> We took our spoons, half-a-pound in weight at least, and
                hammered at the eggs, which were balls of fine meal. I was on the point of throwing
                away my portion. I thought a peachick had already formed. But hearing a practised
                diner say, <quote>What treasure have we here?</quote>
                <pb id="p.51"/> I poked through the shell with my finger, and found a fat becafico
                rolled up in spiced yolk of egg.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/>Trimalchio had now stopped his game, and asked for
                all the same dishes, and in a loud voice invited any of us, who wished, to take a
                second glass of mead. Suddenly the music gave the sign, and the light dishes were
                swept away by a troop of singing servants. An entr&eacute;e-dish happened to
                fall in the rush, and a boy picked it up from the ground. Trimalchio saw him, and
                directed that he should be punished by a box on the ear, and made to throw down the
                dish again. A chairman followed and began to sweep out the silver with a broom among
                the other rubbish. Then two long-haired Ethiopians with little wineskins, just like
                the men who scatter sand in an amphitheatre, came in and gave us wine to wash our
                hands in, for no one offered us water.</p>
            <p>We complimented our host on his arrangements.<quote>Mars loves a fair field,</quote>
                said he, <quote>and so I gave orders that every one should have a separate table. In
                    that way these filthy slaves will not make us so hot by crowding past
                us.</quote></p>
            <p>Just then some glass jars carefully fastened with gypsum were brought on, with labels
                tied to their necks, inscribed, <quote>Falernian of Opimius's vintage, 100 years in
                    bottle.</quote><note>Opimius was consul in 121 B. C.</note> As we were poring
                over the labels Trimalchio clapped his hands and cried, <quote>Ah me, so wine lives
                    longer than miserable man. So let us be merry.<note>The meaning of the word <hi
                            rend="italics">tengomenas</hi> is uncertain. Attempts have been made to

                    and there was a much finer set of people to dinner.</quote> As we drank and
                admired each luxury in detail, a slave brought in a silver skeleton, made so that
                its limbs and spine could be moved and bent in every direction. He put it down once
                or twice on the table so that the supple joints showed several attitudes, and
                Trimalchio said appropriately: <quote>Alas for us poor mortals, all that poor man is
                    is nothing. So we shall all be, after the world below takes us away. Let us live
                    then while it goes well with us.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>After we had praised this outburst a dish followed,
                not at all of the size we expected; but its novelty drew every eye to it There was a
                round plate with the twelve signs of the Zodiac set in order, and on each one the
                artist had laid some food fit and proper to the symbol; over the Ram ram's-head
                pease, a piece of beef on the Bull, kidneys over the Twins, over the Crab a crown,
                an African fig over the Lion, a barren sow's paunch over Virgo, over Libra a pair of

            <p>Trimalchio himself too ground out a tune from the<pb id="p.55"/> musical comedy
                    <quote>Assafoetida</quote> in a most hideous voice. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>We came to such an evil
                entertainment rather depressed.
                <quote>Now,</quote> said Trimalchio, <quote>let us have dinner. This is sauce for
                    the dinner.</quote> As he spoke, four dancers ran up in time with the music and
                took off the top part of the dish. Then we saw in the well of it fat fowls and sow's
                bellies, and in the middle a hare got up with wings to look like Pegasus. Four
                figures of Marsyas at the corners of the dish also caught the eye; they let a spiced
                sauce run from their wine-skins over the fishes, which swam about in a kind of
                tide-race. We all took up the clapping which the slaves started, and attacked these
                delicacies with hearty laughter. Trimalchio was delighted with the trick he had
                played us, and said, <quote>Now, Carver.</quote> The man came up at once, and making
                flourishes in time with the music pulled the dish to pieces; you would have said
                that a gladiator in a chariot was fighting to the accompaniment of a water-organ.
                Still Trimalchio kept on in a soft voice, <quote>Oh, Carver, Carver.</quote> I
                thought this word over and over again must be part of a joke, and I made bold to ask
                the man who sat next me this very question. He had seen performances of this kind
                more often. <quote>You see the fellow who is carving his way through the meat? Well,
                    his name is Carver. So whenever Trimalchio says the word, you have his name, and
                    he has his orders.</quote><note>'Trimalchio's pun on his servant's name is

                fine enough quality. He bought rams from Tarentum and sent them into his flocks with
                a smack behind. He had bees brought from Athens to give him Attic honey on the
                premises; the Roman-born bees incidentally will be improved by the Greeks. Within

                know how it is: the company's pot goes off the boil, and the moment business takes a
                bad turn your friends desert you. You see him in this state: and what a fine trade
                he drove! He was an undertaker. He used to dine like a prince: boars cooked in a
                cloth, wonderful sweet things, game, chefs and confectioners! There used to be more
                wine spilt under the table than many a man has in his cellars. He was a fairy
                prince, not a mortal. When his business was failing, and he was afraid his creditors
                might guess that he was going bankrupt, he advertised a sale in this fashion:
                    <quote>Caius Julius Proculus will offer for sale some articles for which he has

                    now I put nothing on top of the Crab, for fear of weighing down the house of my
                    birth. Under the Lion gluttons and masterful men are born; under Virgo women,
                    and runaway slaves, and chained gangs; under Libra butchers, and perfumers, and
                    generally people who put things to rights; poisoners and assassins under
                    Scorpio; under Sagittarius cross-eyed men, who take the bacon while they look at
                    the vegetables; under Capricornus the poor folk whose troubles make horns sprout
                    on them; under Aquarius innkeepers and men with water on the brain; under Pisces
                    chefs and rhetoricians. So the world turns like a mill, and always brings some
                    evil to pass, causing the birth of men or their death. You saw the green turf in

                coverlets painted with nets, and men lying in wait with hunting spears, and all the
                instruments of the chase. We were still wondering where to turn our expectations,
                when a great shout was raised outside the dining-room, and in came some Spartan
                hounds too, and began running round the table. A tray was brought in after them with
                a wild boar of the largest size upon it, wearing a cap of freedom, with two little
                baskets woven of palm-twigs hanging from his tusks, one full of dry dates and the
                other of fresh. Round it lay suckingpigs made of simnel cake with their mouths to
                the teats, thereby showing that we had a sow before us. These sucking-pigs were for
                the guests to take away. Carver, who had mangled the fowls, did not come to divide
                the boar, but a big bearded man with bands wound round his legs, and a spangled
                hunting-coat of damasked silk, who drew a hunting-knife and plunged it hard into the
                boar's side. A number of thrushes flew out at the blow. As they fluttered round the
                dining-room there were fowlers ready with limed twigs who caught them in a moment.
                Trimalchio ordered everybody to be given his own portion, and added: <quote>Now you
                    see what fine acorns the woodland boar has been eating.</quote> Then boys came
                and took the baskets which hung from her jaws and distributed fresh and dry dates to

            <p>As we were speaking, a beautiful boy with vineleaves and ivy in his hair brought

                wine, Bacchus dreaming, and rendering his master's verses in a most shrill voice.
                Trimalchio turned round at the noise and said, <quote>Dionysus, rise and be
                free.</quote> The boy took the cap of freedom off the boar, and put it on his head.
                Then Trimalchio went on:<quote>I am sure you will agree that the god of liberation

                Trimalchio's phrase, and kissed the boy heartily as he went round.</p>
            <p>After this dish Trimalchio got up and retired. With the tyrant away we had our

                    his friends, open-handed and kept a good table. To begin with, he caught a

                    blockhead, in a fit of passion with his brother, left the family property away
                    to some nobody or other. He that flies from his own family has far to travel.
                    But he had some eaves-dropping slaves who did for him. A man who is always ready

                    no doubt he enjoyed himself every day of his life. Blessed is he who gets the

                    without end, and he was still merry. I really do not think he spared a single
                    creature in his house. No, he was still a gay one, ready for anything. Well, I

                    There has been a famine for a whole year now. Damn the magistrates, who play
                    'Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours,' in league with the bakers. So the
                    little people come off badly; for the jaws of the upper classes are always
                    keeping carnival. I do wish we had the bucks I found here when I first came out
                    of Asia. That was life. If the flour was any but the finest, they beat those
                    vampires into a jelly, until they put the fear of God into them. I remember
                    Safinius: he used to live then by the old arch when I was a boy. He was more of
                    a mustard-pot than a man: used to scorch the ground wherever he trod. Still he
                    was straight; you could trust him, a true friend: you would not be afraid to

                    them down in the senatehouse, every one of them, never using roundabout phrases,
                    making a straightforward attack. And when he was pleading in the courts, his
                    voice used to swell like a trumpet. Never any sweating or spitting: I imagine he
                    had a touch of the Asiatic style. And how kindly he returned one's greeting,
                    calling every one by name quite like one of ourselves. So at that time food was
                    dirt-cheap. You could buy a larger loaf for twopence than you and your better
                    half together could get through. One sees a bun bigger now. Lord, things are
                    worse every day. This town goes downhill like the calfs tail. But why do we put
                    up with a magistrate not worth three pepper-corns, who cares more about putting
                    twopence in his purse than keeping us alive? He sits grinning at home, and
                    pockets more money a day than<pb id="p.75"/> other people have for a fortune. I
                    happen to know where he came by a thousand in gold. If we had any spunk in us he
                    would not be so pleased with himself. Nowadays people are lions in their own
                    houses, and foxes out of doors. I have already eaten my rags, and if these
                    prices keep up, I shall have to sell my cottages. Whatever is to happen if
                    neither the gods nor man will take pity on this town? As I hope to have joy of
                    my children, I believe all these things come from Heaven. For no one now
                    believes that the gods are gods. There is no fasting done, no one cares a button
                    for religion: they all shut their eyes and count their own goods. In old days
                    the mothers in their best robes used to climb the hill with bare feet and loose
                    hair, pure in spirit, and pray Jupiter to send rain. Then it used promptly to
                    rain by the bucket: it was now or never: and they all came home, wet as drowned
                    rats. As it is, the gods are gouty in the feet because we are sceptics. So our

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="45"/><quote>Oh, don't be so gloomy,</quote> said Echion,
                the old clothes dealer. <quote>'There's ups and there's downs,' as the country
                    bumpkin said when he lost his spotted pig. What is not to-day, will be
                    to-morrow: so we trudge through life. I engage you could not name a better
                    country to call one's own, if only the men in it had sense. It has its troubles
                    now like others. We must not be too particular when there is a sky above us all.
                    If you were anywhere else, you would say that roast pork walked in the streets
                    here. Just think, we are soon to be given a superb spectacle lasting three days;
                    not simply a troupe of professional gladiators, but a large number of them
                    freedmen. And our good Titus has a big imagination and is hot-blooded: it will
                    be one thing or another, something real anyway. I know him<pb id="p.77"/> very
                    well, and he is all against half-measures. He will give you the finest blades,
                    no running away, butchery done in the middle, where the whole audience can see
                    it. And he has the wherewithal; he came into thirty million when his father came
                    to grief. If he spends four hundred thousand, his estate will never feel it, and
                    his name will live for ever. He has already collected some clowns, and a woman
                    to fight from a chariot, and Glyco's steward, who was caught amusing Glyco's
                    wife. You will see the crowd quarrel, jealous husbands against gallants. A
                    twopenny halfpenny fellow like Glyco goes throwing his steward to the beasts. He
                    only gives himself away. It is not the slave's fault; he had to do as he was
                    told. That filthy wife of his rather deserved to be tossed by the bull. But a
                    man who cannot beat his donkey, beats the saddle. How did Glyco suppose that a
                    sprig of Hermogenes's sowing would ever come to a good end? He was one for
                    paring the claws of a kite on the wing, and you do not gather figs from
                        thistles.<note>Literally <quote>a viper does not bring forth a

                    He will be branded as long as he lives, and nothing but death will wipe it out.
                    But a man must have his faults. My nose prophesies a good meal from Mammaea,
                    twopence each for me and mine. If he does, he will put Norbanus<note>A

                    beat him hands down. After all, what has Norbanus ever done for us? He produced
                    some decayed twopenny-halfpenny gladiators, who would have fallen flat if you
                    breathed on them; I have seen better ruffians turned in to fight the wild
                    beasts. He shed the blood of some mounted infantry that might<pb id="p.79"/>
                    have come off a lamp; dunghill cocks you would have called them: one a spavined
                    mule, the other bandylegged, and the holder of the bye, just one corpse instead
                    of another, and hamstrung. One man, a Thracian, had some stuffing, but he too
                    fought according to the rule of the schools. In short, they were all flogged
                    afterwards. How the great crowd roared at them, Lay it on'! They were mere
                    runaways, to be sure. 'Still, says Norbanus, I did give you a treat.' Yes, and I
                    clap my hands at you. Reckon it up, and I give you more than I got. One good
                    turn deserves another.<milestone unit="section" n="46"/> Now, Agamemnon, you
                    look as if you were saying, 'What is this bore chattering for?' Only because you
                    have the gift of tongues and do not speak. You do not come off our shelf, and so
                    you make fun of the way we poor men talk. We know you are mad with much
                    learning. But I tell you what; can I persuade you to come down to my place some
                    day and see my little property? We shall find something to eat, a chicken and
                    eggs: it will be delightful, even though the weather this year has made
                    everything grow at the wrong time: we shall find something to fill ourselves up
                    with. My little boy is growing into a follower of yours already. He can do
                    simple division now; if he lives, you will have a little servant at your heels.
                    Whenever he has any spare time, he never lifts his nose from the slate. He is
                    clever, and comes of a good stock, even though he is too fond of birds. I killed
                    three of his goldfinches just lately, and said a weasel had eaten them. But he
                    has found some other hobby, and has taken to painting with great pleasure. He
                    has made a hole in his Greek now, and begins to relish Latin finely, even though
                    his master is conceited and will not stick to one thing at a time. The boy
                        comes<pb id="p.81"/> asking me to give him some writing to do, though he
                    does not want to work. I have another boy who is no scholar, but very inquiring,
                    and can teach you more than he knows himself. So on holidays he generally comes
                    home, and is quite pleased whatever you give him. I bought the child some books
                    with red-letter headings in them a little time ago. I want him to have a smack
                    of law in order to manage the property. Law has bread and butter in it. He has
                    dipped quite deep enough into literature. If he is restless, I mean to have him
                    learn a trade, a barber or an auctioneer, or at least a barrister, something
                    that he can carry to the grave with him. So I drum it into him every day: Mark
                    my words, Primigenius, whatever you learn, you learn for your own good. Look at
                    Phileros, the barrister: if he had not worked, he would not be keeping the wolf
                    from the door today. It is not so long since he used to carry things round on
                    his back and sell them, and now he makes a brave show even against Norbanus.
                    Yes, education is a treasure, and culture never dies.'</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="47"/>Gossip of this kind was in the air, when Trimalchio
                came in mopping his brow, and washed his hands in scent. After a short pause, he
                said, <quote>You will excuse me, gentlemen? My bowels have not been working for
                    several days. All the doctors are puzzled. Still, I found pomegranate rind
                    useful, and pinewood boiled in vinegar. I hope now my stomach will learn to
                    observe its old decencies. Besides, I have such rumblings inside me you would
                    think there was a bull there. So if any of you gentlemen wishes to retire there
                    is no need to be shy about it. We were none of us born quite solid. I cannot
                    imagine any torture like holding oneself in. The one thing Jupiter himself
                    cannot forbid<pb id="p.83"/> is that we should have relief. Why do you laugh,
                    Fortunata; it is you who are always keeping me awake all night. Of course, as
                    far as I am concerned, anyone may relieve himself in the dining-room. The
                    doctors forbid retention. But if the matter is serious, everything is ready
                    outside: water, towels, and all the other little comforts. Take my word for it,
                    vapours go to the brain and make a disturbance throughout the body. I know many
                    people have died this way, by refusing to admit the truth to themselves.</quote>
                We thanked him for his generosity and kindness, and then tried to suppress our
                laughter by drinking hard and fast. We did not yet realize that we had only got
                halfway through the delicacies, and still had an uphill task before us, as they say.
                The tables were cleared to the sound of music, and three white pigs, adorned with
                muzzles and bells, were led into the dining-room. One was two years old, the keeper
                said, the second three, and the other as much as six. I thought some ropewalkers had
                come in, and that the pigs would perform some wonderful tricks, as they do for
                crowds in the streets. Trimalchio ended our suspense by saying, <quote>Now, which of
                    them would you like turned into a dinner this minute? Any country hand can turn
                    out a fowl or a Pentheus<note>Pentheus, king of Thebes, was torn in pieces by

                    to serving whole calves done in a cauldron.</quote> Then he told them to fetch a
                cook at once, and without waiting for our opinion ordered the eldest pig to be
                killed, and said in a loud voice,<quote>Which division of the household do you
                    belong to?</quote> The man said he came from the fortieth. <quote>Were you
                    purchased or born on the estate?</quote>
                <quote>Neither; I was left to you under Pansa's will.</quote>

                    power, and the dish that was to be carried him
                off to the kitchen. Trimalchio turned to us with a mild expression and said,<quote>I
                    will change the wine if you do not like it. You will have to give it its

                    Just now I want to join up all Sicily with properties of mine, so that if I take
                    a fancy to go to Africa I shall travel through my own land. But do tell me,

                    to-day? Of course, I do not practise in court myself, but I learned literature
                    for domestic purposes. And do not imagine that I despise learning. I have got
                    two libraries, one Greek and one Latin. So give me an outline of your speech, if
                    you love me.</quote> Then Agamemnon said: <quote>A poor man and a rich man were
                    once at enmity.</quote>
                <quote>But what is a poor man?</quote> Trimalchio replied. <quote>Very
                clever,</quote> said Agamemnon, and went on expounding some problem or other.
                Trimalchio at once retorted: <quote>If the thing really happened, there is no
                    problem; if it never happened, it is all nonsense.</quote> We followed up this
                and other sallies with the most extravagant admiration.<quote>Tell me, dear
                    Agamemnon,</quote> said Trimalchio, <quote>do you know anything of the twelve
                    labours of Hercules, or the story of Ulysses and how the Cyclops twisted his
                    thumb with the tongs? I used to read these things in Homer when I was a boy.
                    Yes, and I myself with my own<pb id="p.87"/> eyes saw the Sibyl hanging in a

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/>He had still more talk to puff out, when the table
                was filled by a dish holding an enormous pig. We began to express astonishment at
                such speed, and took our oath that not even a fowl could have been properly cooked
                in the time, especially as the pig seemed to us to be much bigger than the boar had
                been a little while earlier. Trimalchio looked at it more and more closely and then
                said, <quote>What, what, has not this pig been gutted? I swear it has not. The cook,
                    send the cook up here to us.</quote> The poor cook came and stood by the table
                and said that he had forgotten to gut it. <quote>What? Forgotten?</quote> shouted
                rrimalchio. <quote>You would think the fellow had only forgotten to season it with
                    pepper and cummin. Off with his shirt!</quote> In a moment the cook was stripped
                and stood dolefully between two executioners. Then we all began to beg him off and
                say: <quote>These things will happen; do let him go; if he does it again none of us
                    will say a word for him.</quote> I was as stiff and stern as could be; I could
                not restrain myself, but leaned over and said in Agamemnon's ear: <quote>This must
                    be a most wretched servant; how could anyone forget to gut a pig? On my oath I
                    would not forgive him if he had let a fish go like that.</quote> But
                Trimalchio's face softened into smiles. <quote>Well,</quote> he said, <quote>if your
                    memory is so bad, clean him here in front of us.</quote> The cook put on his
                shirt, seized a knife, and carved the pig's belly in various places with a shaking
                hand. At once the<pb id="p.89"/> slits widened under the pressure from within, and
                sausages and black puddings tumbled out.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="50"/>At this the slaves burst into spontaneous applause
                and shouted, <quote>God bless Gaius!</quote> The cook too was rewarded with a drink
                and a silver crown, and was handed the cup on a Corinthian dish. Agamemnon began to
                peer at the dish rather closely, and Trimalchio said, <quote>I am the sole owner of
                    genuine Corinthian plate.</quote> I thought he would declare with his usual
                effrontery that he had cups imported direct from Corinth. But he went one better:
                    <quote>You may perhaps inquire,</quote> said he, <quote>how I come to be alone
                    in having genuine Corinthian stuff: the obvious reason is that the name of the
                    dealer I buy it from is Corinthus. But what is real Corinthian, unless a man has
                    Corinthus at his back? Do not imagine that I am an ignoramus. I know perfectly
                    well how Corinthian plate was first brought into the world. At the fall of
                    Ilium, Hannibal, a trickster and a great knave, collected all the sculptures,
                    bronze, gold, and silver, into a single pile, and set light to them. They all
                    melted into one amalgam of bronze. The workmen took bits out of this lump and
                    made plates and entree dishes and statuettes. That is how Corinthian metal was
                    born, from all sorts lumped together, neither one kind nor the other. You will
                    forgive me if I say that personally I prefer glass; glass at least does not
                    smell. If it were not so breakable I should prefer it to gold; as it is, it is
                    so cheap.<milestone unit="section" n="51"/> But there was once a workman who
                    made a glass cup that was unbreakable. So he was given an audience of the
                    Emperor with his invention; he made Caesar give it back to him and then threw it
                    on the floor. Caesar was as frightened as could be. But the man picked up his
                    cup from the ground: it<pb id="p.91"/> was dinted like a bronze bowl; then he
                    took a little hammer out of his pocket and made the cup quite sound again
                    without any trouble. After doing this he thought he had himself seated on the
                    throne of Jupiter, especially when Caesar said to him: 'Does anyone else know
                    how to blow glass like this?' Just see what happened. He said not, and then
                    Caesar had him beheaded. Why? Because if his invention were generally known we
                    should treat gold like dirt. Myself I have a great passion for silver.<milestone

                    id="p.93"/> to dinner. Trimalchio warmed to his drinking under our flattery, and
                was almost drunk when he said:<quote>None of you ask dear Fortunata to dance. I tell
                    you no one can dance the cancan better.</quote> He then lifted his hands above
                his head and gave us the actor Syrus, while all the slaves sang in chorus:<quote
                    rend="blockquote">

                </quote> And Trimalchio would have come out into the middle of the room if Fortunata
                had not whispered in his ear. I suppose she told him that such low fooling was
                beneath his dignity. But never was anything so variable; at one moment he was afraid
                of Fortunata, and then he would return to his natural self.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="53"/>But a clerk quite interrupted his passion for the
                dance by reading as though from the gazette: <quote>July the 26th. Thirty boys and
                    forty girls were born on Trimalchio's estate at Cumae. Five hundred thousand
                    pecks of wheat were taken up from the threshing-floor into the barn. Five
                    hundred oxen were broken in. On the same date: the slave Mithridates was led to
                    crucifixion for having damned the soul of our lord Gaius. On the same date: ten
                    million sesterces which could not be invested were returned to the reserve. On
                    the same day: there was a fire in our gardens at Pompeii, which broke out in the
                    house of Nasta the bailiff.</quote>
                <quote>Stop,</quote> said Trimalchio, <quote>When did I buy any gardens at Pompeii?</quote>
                <quote>Last year,</quote> said the clerk, <quote>so that they are not entered in
                    your accounts yet.</quote> Trimalchio glowed with passion, and said, <quote>I
                    will not have any property which is bought in my name entered in my accounts<pb
                        id="p.95"/> unless I hear of it within six months.</quote> We now had a
                further recitation of police notices, and some foresters' wills, in which Trimalchio
                was cut out in a codicil; then the names of bailiffs, and of a freed-woman who had
                been caught with a bathman and divorced by her husband, a night watchman; the name
                of a porter who had been banished to Baiae; the name of a steward who was being
                prosecuted, and details of an action between some valets.</p>
            <p>But at last the acrobats came in. A very dull fool stood there with a ladder and made
                a boy dance from rung to rung and on the very top to the music of popular airs, and
                then made him hop through burning hoops, and pick up a wine jar with his teeth. No
                one was excited by this but Trimalchio, who kept saying that it was a thankless
                profession. There were only two things in the world that he could watch with real
                pleasure, acrobats and trumpeters; all other shows were silly nonsense.
                <quote>Why,</quote> said he, <quote>I once bought a Greek comedy company, but I
                    preferred them to do Atellane plays,<note>Native Latin comedy as opposed to <hi
                            rend="italics">comoedia palliata,</hi> which was translated or adapted
                        from the Greek.</note> and I told my flute-player to have Latin
                songs.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/>Just as Trimalchio was speaking the boy slipped and
                fell [against his arm]. The slaves raised a cry, and so did the guests, not over a
                disgusting creature whose neck they would have been glad to see broken, but because
                it would have been a gloomy finish to the dinner to have to shed tears over the
                death of a perfect stranger. Trimalchio groaned aloud, and nursed his arm as if it
                was hurt. Doctors rushed up, and among the first Fortunata, with her hair down, and
                a cup in her hand, calling out what a poor unhappy<pb id="p.97"/> woman she was. The
                creature who had fallen down was crawling round at our feet by this time, and
                begging for mercy. I was very much afraid that his petition was leading up to some
                comic surprise. The cook who had forgotten to gut the pig had not yet faded from my
                recollection. So I began looking all round the dining-room, in case any clockwork
                toy should jump out of the wall, especially after they had begun to beat a servant
                for dressing the bruise on his master's arm with white wool instead of purple. And
                my suspicions were not far out. Instead of punishment there came Trimalchio's decree
                that he should be made a free man, for fear anyone might be able to say that our
                hero had been wounded by a slave.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="55"/>We applauded his action, and made small talk in
                different phrases about the uncertainty of man's affairs.<quote>Ah,</quote> said
                Trimalchio, <quote>then we should not let this occasion slip without a
                record.</quote> And he called at once for paper, and after very brief reflection
                declaimed these halting verses:</p>
            <p>
                <quote>What men do not look for turns about and comes to pass. And high over us
                    Fortune directs our affairs. Wherefore, slave, hand us Falernian wine.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>A discussion of poetry arose out of this epigram, and for a long time it was
                maintained that Mopsus of Thrace held the crown of song in his hand, until
                Trimalchio said, "Now, I ask you as a scholar, how would you compare Cicero and
                    Publilius?<note>Publilius is Publilius Syrus, a famous writer of farce. It is

                    are the hardest workers: the oxen, because thanks to the oxen we have bread to
                    eat; the sheep, because their wool clothes us in splendour. It is a gross
                    outrage when people eat lamb and wear shirts. Yes, and I hold the bees to be the

                    please myself, and preferred being a Roman citizen to going on paying taxes as a
                    provincial. And now I hope I live such a life that no one can jeer at me. I am a
                    man among men; I walk about bare-headed; I owe nobody a brass farthing; I have
                    never been in the Courts; no one has ever said to me in public, 'Pay me what you
                    owe me.' I have bought a few acres and collected a little capital; I have to
                    feed twenty bellies and a dog: I ransomed my fellow slave to preserve her from
                    indignities; I paid a thousand silver pennies formy own freedom; I was made a

                    One word more. Who ever had to speak to me twice? I was a slave for forty years,
                    and nobody knew whether I was a slave or free. I was a boy with long curls when

                    I tried to please my master, a fine dignified gentleman whose little finger was

                    a foot to trip me up here and there. But still&mdash;God bless my
                    master!&mdash;I struggled through. These are real victories: being born free
                    is as easy as saying, Come here.' But why do you stare at me now like a goat in

                    show you the story in a minute.</quote> As he spoke the heroes raised a shout,
                and the slaves stood back to let a boiled calf on a presentation dish be brought in.
                There was a helmet on its head. Ajax followed and attacked it with his sword drawn
                as if he were mad; and after making passes with the edge and the flat he collected
                slices on the point, and divided the calf among the astonished company.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="60"/>We were not given long to admire these elegant<hi
                    rend="italics">tours de force;</hi> suddenly there came a noise from the
                ceiling, and the whole dining-room trembled. I rose from my place in a panic: I was
                afraid some acrobat would come down through the roof. All the other guests too
                looked up astonished, wondering what the new portent from heaven was announced. The
                whole ceiling parted asunder, and an enormous hoop, apparently knocked out of a
                giant cask, was let down. All round it were hung golden crowns and alabaster boxes
                of perfumes. We were asked to take these presents for ourselves, when I looked back
                at the table. . . . A dish with some cakes on it had now been put there, a Priapus
                made by the confectioner standing in the middle, holding up every kind of fruit and
                grapes in his wide apron in the conventional style. We reached greedily after his
                treasures, and a sudden fresh turn of humour renewed our merriment. All the cakes
                and all the fruits, however lightly they were touched, began to spurt out saffron,
                and the nasty juice flew<pb id="p.113"/> even into our mouths. We thought it must be
                a sacred dish that was anointed with such holy appointments, and we all stood
                straight up and cried, <quote>The gods bless Augustus, the father of his
                country.</quote> But as some people even after this solemnity snatched at the fruit,
                we filled our napkins too, myself especially, for I thought that I could never fill
                Giton's lap with a large enough present. Meanwhile three boys came in with their
                white tunics well tucked up, and two of them put images of the Lares with lockets
                round their necks on the table, while one carried round a bowl of wine and cried,
                    <quote>God be gracious unto us.</quote></p>
            <p>Trimalchio said that one of the images was called Gain, another Luck, and the third
                Profit. And as everybody else kissed Trimalchio's true portrait we were ashamed to
                pass it by.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/>So after they had all wished themselves good sense
                and good health, Trimalchio looked at Niceros and said, <quote>You used to be better
                    company at a dinner; I do not know why you are dumb now, and do not utter a
                    sound. Do please, to make me happy, tell us of your adventure.</quote> Niceros
                was delighted by his friend's amiability and said, <quote>May I never turn another
                    penny if I am not ready to burst with joy at seeing you in such a good humour.
                    Well, it shall be pure fun then, though I am afraid your clever friends will
                    laugh at me. Still, let them; I will tell my story; what harm does a man's laugh
                    do me? Being laughed at is more satisfactory than being sneered at.</quote> So
                spake the hero,<note>See Virgil, <hi rend="italics">&AElig;neid</hi> II,
                790.</note> and began the following story:</p>
            <p>
                <quote>'While I was still a slave, we were living in a narrow street; the house now
                    belongs to Gavilla. There it was God's will that I should fall in love with<pb
                        id="p.115"/> the wife of Terentius the inn-keeper; you remember her, Melissa
                    of Tarentum, a pretty round thing. But I swear it was no base passion; I did not
                    care about her in that way, but rather because she had a beautiful nature. If I
                    asked her for anything it was never refused me; if she made twopence I had a
                    penny; whatever I had I put into her pocket, and I was never taken in. Now one
                    day her husband died on the estate.<note>Terentius was a slave managing the
                        tavern for his master.</note> So I buckled on my shield and greaves, and
                    schemed how to come at her: and as you know, one's friends turn up in tight
                    places. My master happened to have gone to Capua to look after some silly
                        business<note>Lit., elegant trash.</note> or other.<milestone unit="section"
                        n="62"/> I seized my opportunity, and persuaded a guest in our house to come
                    with me as far as the fifth milestone. He was a soldier, and as brave as Hell.
                    So we trotted off about cockcrow; the moon shone like high noon. We got among
                    the tombstones:<note>They would be by the roadside.</note> my man went aside to
                    look at the epitaphs, I sat down with my heart full of song and began to count
                    the graves. Then when I looked round at my friend, he stripped himself and put
                    all his clothes by the roadside. My heart was in my mouth, but I stood like a
                    dead man. He made a ring of water round his clothes and suddenly turned into a
                    wolf. Please do not think I am joking; I would not lie about this for any
                    fortune in the world. But as I was saying, after he had turned into a wolf, he
                    began to howl, and ran off into the woods. At first I hardly knew where I was,
                    then I went up to take his clothes; but they had all turned into stone. No one
                    could be nearer dead with terror than I was. But I drew my sword and went
                    slaying shadows all the way till I<pb id="p.117"/> came to my love's house. I
                    went in like a corpse, and nearly gave up the ghost, the sweat ran down my legs,
                    my eyes were dull, I could hardly be revived. My dear Melissa was surprised at
                    my being out so late, and said, 'If you had come earlier you might at least have
                    helped us; a wolf got into the house and worried all our sheep, and let their
                    blood like a butcher. But he did not make fools of us, even though he got off;
                    for our slave made a hole in his neck with a spear.' When I heard this, I could
                    not keep my eyes shut any longer, but at break of day I rushed back to my master
                    Gaius's house like a defrauded publican, and when I came to the place where the
                    clothes were turned into stone, I found nothing but a pool of blood. But when I
                    reached home, my soldier was lying in bed like an ox, with a doctor looking
                    after his neck. I realized that he was a werewolf, and I never could sit down to
                    a meal with him afterwards, not if you had killed me first. Other people may
                    think what they like about this; but may all your guardian angels punish me if I
                    am lying.</quote>

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="63"/>We were all dumb with astonishment, but Trimalchio
                said, <quote>I pick no holes in your story; by the soul of truth, how my hair stood
                    on end! For I know that Niceros never talks nonsense: he is very dependable, and
                    not at all a chatterbox. Now I want to tell you a tale of horror myself: but I'm
                    a donkey on the tiles compared with him. While I still had hair down my back,
                    for I lived delicately<note>Literally <quote>a Chian life,</quote> i.e.
                        luxurious and vicious. Thucydides calls the Chians shameless.</note> from my
                    youth up, my master's favourite died. Oh! he was a pearl, one in a thousand, and
                    a mirror of perfection! So while his poor mother was bewailing him, and several
                    of us were<pb id="p.119"/> sharing her sorrow, suddenly the witches began to
                    screech; you would have thought there was a dog pursuing a hare. We had a
                    Cappadocian in the house at the time, a tall fellow, mighty brave and a man of
                    muscle; he could lift an angry bull off the ground. He rushed boldly out of
                    doors with a naked sword, having carefully wrapped up his left hand, and ran the
                    woman through the middle, just about here&mdash;may the spot my finger is on
                    be safe! We heard a groan, but to tell the honest truth we did not see the
                    witches themselves. But our big fellow came back and threw himself on a bed: and
                    his whole body was blue as if he had been flogged, of course because the witch's
                    hand had touched him. We shut the door and returned to our observances, but when
                    the mother put her arms round the body of her son, she felt it and saw that it
                    was a little bundle of straw. It had no heart, no inside or anything: of course
                    the witches had carried off the boy and put a straw changeling in his place. Ah!
                    yes, I would beg you to believe there are wise women, and night-riders, who can
                    turn the whole world upside down. Well, the tall slave never came back to his
                    proper colour after this affair, and died raving mad in a few days.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/>We were full of wonder and faith, and we kissed the
                table and prayed the Night-riders to stay at home as we returned from dinner.</p>
            <p>By this time, I own, the lamps were multiplying before my eyes, and the whole
                dining-room was altering; then Trimalchio said, <quote>Come you, Plocamus, have you
                    got no story? Will you not entertain us? You used to be more pleasant company,
                    and recite blank verse very prettily, and put in songs too. Dear, dear, all the
                    sweet green figs are fallen!</quote>
                <quote>Ah, yes,</quote> the man replied, <quote>my galloping days are over since
                        I<pb id="p.121"/> was taken with the gout. In the days when I was a young
                    fellow I nearly got consumption with singing. How I could dance and recite and
                    imitate the talk in a barber's shop! Was there ever my equal, except the one and
                    only Apelles?</quote> And he put his hand to his mouth and whistled out some
                offensive stuff I did not catch: he declared afterwards it was Greek.</p>
            <p>Then Trimalchio, after imitating a man with a trumpet, looked round for his
                favourite, whom he called Croesus. The creature had blear eyes and very bad teeth,
                and was tying up an unnaturally obese black puppy in a green handkerchief, and then
                putting a broken piece of bread on a chair, and cramming it down the throat of the
                dog, who did not want it and was sick. This reminded Trimalchio of his duties, and
                he ordered them to bring in Scylax, <quote>the guardian of the house and the
                slaves.</quote> An enormous dog on a chain was at once led in, and on receiving a
                kick from the porter as a hint to lie down, he curled up in front of the table. Then
                Trimalchio threw him a bit of white bread and said,<quote>No one in the house loves
                    me better than Scylax.</quote> The favourite took offence at his lavish praise
                of the dog, and put down the puppy, and encouraged him to attack Scylax. Scylax,
                after the manner of dogs, filled the dining-room with a most hideous barking, and
                nearly tore Croesus's little Pearl to pieces. And the uproar did not end with a
                dog-fight, for a lamp upset over the table, and broke all the glass to pieces, and
                sprinkled some of the guests with hot oil. Trimalchio did not want to seem hurt at
                his loss, so he kissed his favourite, and told him to jump on his back. He mounted
                his horse at once and went on smacking Trimalchio's shoulders with his open<pb
                    id="p.123"/> hand, saying, <quote>How many are we, blind man's
                        cheek?</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Bucca</hi> was a child's game
                    (Hoodman Blind in English) where one child was blindfolded and the others
                    touched him on the cheek, and asked him how many fingers, or how many children,
                    had touched him.</note> After some time Trimalchio calmed himself, and ordered a
                great bowl of wine to be mixed, and drinks to be served round to all the slaves, who
                were sitting at our feet, adding this provision: <quote>If anyone refuses to take
                    it, pour it over his head; business in the daytime and pleasure at
                night.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/>After this display of kindness, some savouries were
                brought in, the memory of which, as sure as I tell you this story, still makes me
                shudder. For instead of a thrush a fat chicken was brought round to each of us, and
                goose-eggs in caps, which Trimalchio kept asking us to eat with the utmost
                insistence, saying that they were chickens without the bones. Meanwhile a priest's
                    attendant<note>The attendant on a Sevir Augusti. See note, p. 43.</note> knocked
                at the diningroom door, and a man dressed in white for some festivity came in with a
                number of others. I was frightened by his solemn looks, and thought the mayor had
                arrived. So I tried to get up and plant my bare feet on the ground. Agamemnon
                laughed at my anxiety and said, <quote>Control yourself, you silly fool! It is
                    Habinnas of the priests' college, a monumental mason with a reputation for
                    making first-class tombstones.</quote> I was relieved by this news, and lay down
                in my place again, and watched Habinnas' entrance with great astonishment. He was
                quite drunk, and had put his hands on his wife's shoulders; he had several wreaths
                on, and ointment was running down his forehead into his eyes. He sat down in the<pb

                his good humour, and demanded a larger cup for himself, and asked him how he had
                been received. <quote>We had everything there except you,</quote> was the reply,
                    <quote>for my eyes were here with you. Yes, it was really splendid. Scissa was
                    having a funeral feast on the ninth day for her poor dear slave, whom she set
                    free on his deathbed. And I believe she will have an enormous sum to pay the
                    tax-collector, for they reckon that the dead man was worth fifty
                        thousand.<note>She would pay a tax of 5 per cent, i.e. 2,500 sesterces, on
                        his value.</note> But anyhow it was a pleasant affair, even if we did have
                    to pour half our drinks over his lamented bones.</quote><milestone
                    unit="section" n="66"/>
                <quote>Ah,</quote> said Trimalchio, <quote>but what did you have for dinner?</quote>
                <quote>I will tell you if I can,</quote> he said, <quote>but my memory is in such a
                    fine way that I often forget my own name. Well, first we had a pig crowned with
                    a wine-cup, garnished with honey cakes, and liver very well done, and beetroot
                    of course, and pure wholemeal bread, which I prefer to white myself; it puts
                    strength into you, and is good for the bowels. The next dish was a cold tart,
                    with excellent Spanish wine poured over warm honey. Indeed I ate a lot of the
                    tart, and gave myself such a soaking of honey. Pease and lupines were handed, a
                    choice of nuts and an apple each. I took two myself, and I have got them here
                    tied up in my napkin: for if I do not bring some present back for my pet
                    slave-boy there will be trouble. Oh! yes, my wife reminds me. There was a piece
                    of bear on a side dish. Scintilla was rash<pb id="p.127"/> enough to taste it,
                    and nearly brought up her own inside. I ate over a pound myself, for it tasted
                    like proper wild boar. What I say is this, since bears eat up us poor men, how
                    much better right has a poor man to eat up a bear? To finish up with we had
                    cheese mellowed in new wine, and snails all round, and pieces of tripe, and
                    liver in little dishes, and eggs in caps, and turnip, and mustard, and a dish of
                    forcemeat. But hold hard, Palamedes.<note><hi rend="italics">Pax</hi> is an
                        exclamation unconnected with the noun <hi rend="italics">pax,</hi>
                        <quote>peace.</quote> The meaning of its conjunction with the word Palamedes
                        is unknown: it may be merely due to the charm of alliteration.</note>
                    Pickled olives were brought round in a dish too, and some greedy creatures took
                    three handfuls. For we had let the ham go.<milestone unit="section" n="67"/> But
                    tell me, Gaius, why is Fortunata not at dinner?</quote>
                <quote>Do you not know her better?</quote> said Trimalchio.<quote>Until she has

                <quote>Oh,</quote> replied Habinnas, <quote>but unless she is here I shall take
                    myself off,</quote> and he was just getting up, when at a given signal all the
                slaves called <quote>Fortunata</quote> four times and more. So she came in with a
                high yellow waist-band on, which allowed a cherry-red bodice to appear under it, and
                twisted anklets, and white shoes embroidered with gold. She wiped her hands on a
                cloth which she had round her neck, took her place on the sofa, where Scintilla,
                Habinnas's wife, was lying, kissed her as she was clapping her hands, and said,
                    <quote>Is it really you, dear?</quote></p>
            <p>Fortunata then went so far as to take the bracelets off her fat arms to exhibit them
                to Scintilla's admiring gaze. At last she even took off her anklets<pb id="p.129"/>
                and her hair-net, which she said was eighteen carat. Trimalchio saw her, and ordered
                the whole lot to be brought to him. <quote>There,</quote> he said, <quote>are a

                    must have six pounds and a half of gold on her. I have got a bracelet myself,
                    made out of the percentage which I owe to Mercury, that weighs not an ounce
                    under ten pounds.</quote> At last, for fear we should think he was lying, he
                ordered the scales to be brought, and had the weight carried round and tested.
                Scintilla was just as bad. She took off a little gold box from her neck, which she
                called her lucky box. Then she brought out two earrings, and gave them to Fortunata
                to look at in her turn, and said, <quote>Thanks to my husband's kindness, nobody has
                    finer ones.</quote>
                <quote>What?</quote> said Habinnas, you bullied me to buy you a glass bean. I
                declare if I had a daughter I would cut off her ears. If there were no women, we
                should never trouble about anything: as it is, we sweat for them and get cold
                thanks."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the tipsy wives laughed together, and gave each other drunken kisses, one
                prating of her prudence as a housewife, the other of the favourites of her husband
                and his inattention to her. While they were hobnobbing, Habinnas got up quietly,
                took Fortunata by the legs, and threw her over on the sofa. She shouted out,
                    <quote>Oh! goodness!</quote> and her dress flew up over her knees. She took
                refuge in Scintilla's arms, and buried her burning red face in a napkin.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="68"/>After an interval, Trimalchio ordered fresh relays
                of food to be brought in. The slaves took away all the tables, brought in others,
                and sprinkled about sawdust coloured with saffron and vermilion, and, what I had<pb
                    id="p.131"/> never seen before, powdered talc. Trimalchio at once said, <quote>I
                    might really be satisfied with this course; for you have got your fresh relays.
                    But if there is anything nice, put it on.</quote></p>
            <p>Meanwhile a boy from Alexandria, who was handing hot water, began to imitate a
                nightingale, and made Trimalchio shout, <quote>Oh! change the tune.</quote> Then
                there was another joke. A slave, who was sitting at the feet of Habinnas, began, by
                his master's orders I suppose, suddenly to cry in a loud voice:<quote
                    rend="blockquote">

                </quote> No sharper sound ever pierced my ears; for besides his making barbarous

                    verse; probably improper. See note, p. 95.</note> with it, so that Virgil jarred
                on me for the first time in my life. All the same, Habinnas supplied applause when
                he had at last left off, and said, <quote>He never went to school, but I educated
                    him by sending him round the hawkers in the market. So he has no equal when he
                    wants to imitate mule-drivers or hawkers. He is terribly clever; he is a cobbler
                    too, a cook, a confectioner, a slave of all the talents. He has only two faults,
                    and if he were rid of them he would be simply perfect. He is a Jew and he
                    snores. For I do not mind his being cross-eyed; he has a look like Venus. So
                    that is why he cannot keep silent, and scarcely ever shuts his eyes. I bought
                    him for three hundred denarii.</quote> Scintilla interrupted his story by

                <quote>To be sure you have forgotten some of the tricks of the vile slave. He is a

                and said, <quote><hi rend="italics">Oh!</hi> I perceive he is a Cappadocian; he does
                    not deny himself,<pb id="p.133"/> and, upon my word, I admire him; for no one
                    can send a dead man any fun. And please do not be jealous, Scintilla. Take my
                    word for it, we know you women too. By my hope of salvation, I used to amuse my
                    own mistress, until even the master became suspicious; and so he banished me to
                    a country stewardship. But peace, my tongue, and you shall have some
                bread.</quote> The worthless slave took a clay lamp out of his dress, as if he had
                been complimented, and imitated trumpeters for more than half an hour, Habinnas
                singing with him and pulling his lower lip down. Finally, he came right into the
                middle of the room, and shook a pipe of reeds in imitation of flute-players, or gave
                us the mule-driver's life, with a cloak and a whip, till Habinnas called him and
                gave him a kiss, and offered him a drink, saying, <quote>Better than ever, Massa. I
                    will give you a pair of boots.</quote></p>
            <p>There would have been no end to our troubles if a last course had not been brought
                in, thrushes made of fine meal and stuffed with raisins and nuts. There followed
                also quinces, stuck all over with thorns to look like sea-urchins. We could have
                borne this, if a far more fantastic dish had not driven us even to prefer death by
                starvation. What we took to be a fat goose, with fish and all kinds of birds round
                it, was put on, and then Trimalchio said, <quote>My friends, whatever you see here
                    on the table is made out of one body.</quote> With my usual intelligence, I knew
                at once what it was; I looked at Agamemnon and said, <quote>I shall be surprised if
                    the whole thing is not made out of filth, or at any rate clay. I have seen sham
                    dinners of this kind served in Rome at the Saturnalia.</quote> I had not
                finished speaking when Trimalchio said,<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
                <quote>As I hope to grow in gains and not in girth, my cook<pb id="p.135"/> made the
                    whole thing out of a pig. There could not be a more valuable fellow. If you want
                    it, he will make you a fish out of a sow's belly, a woodpigeon out of bacon, a
                    turtledove out of a ham, and a chicken out of a knuckle of pork. That gave me
                    the idea of putting a very pretty name on him; he is called Daedalus.<note>A
                        common nickname for a Jack of all trades.</note> And because he is so
                    intelligent, I brought him back from Rome some knives, made of steel of Noricum,
                    as a present.</quote> He had these knives brought in at once, and contemplated
                them with admiration. He even allowed us to try the edge on our cheeks.</p>
            <p>Suddenly two slaves came in who had apparently been fighting at a water-tank; at
                least they still had waterpots on their necks. Trimalchio sat in judgment on the
                dispute, but neither of them accepted his decision, and they smashed each other's
                waterpots With sticks. We were amazed at their drunken folly, and stared at them
                fighting, and then we saw oysters and cockles fall out of the pots, and a boy picked
                them up and brought them round on a dish. The clever cook was a match for this
                exhibition; he offered us snails on a silver gridiron, and sang in an extremely ugly
                quavering voice.</p>
            <p>I am ashamed to tell you what followed: in defiance of all convention, some
                long-haired boys brought ointment in a silver basin, and anointed our feet as we
                lay, after winding little garlands round our feet and ankles. A quantity of the same
                ointment was then poured into the mixing-bowl and the lamp.</p>
            <p>Fortunata had now grown anxious to dance; Scintilla clapped her hands more often than

                were nearly pushed off the sofas with the slaves crowding into every seat. Anyhow, I
                noticed that the cook, who had made a goose out of the pig, sat stinking of pickle
                and sauces just above me. Not satisfied with having a seat, he at once began to
                imitate the tragedian Ephesus, and then invited his own master to make a bet on the
                green being first in the next games.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="71"/>Trimalchio cheered up at this dispute and
                    said,<quote>Ah, my friends, a slave is a man and drank his mother's milk like

                    shall soon taste the water of freedom. In fact I am setting them all free in my
                    will. I am leaving a property and his good woman to Philargyrus as well, and to
                    Cario a block of buildings, and his manumission fees, and a bed and bedding. I
                    am making Fortunata my heir, and I recommend her to all my friends. I am making
                    all this known so that my slaves may love me now as it I were dead.</quote> They
                all began to thank their master for his kindness, when he turned serious, and had a
                copy of the will brought in, which he read aloud from beginning to end, while the
                slaves moaned and groaned. Then he looked at Habinnas and said, <quote>Now tell me,
                    my dear friend: you will erect a monument as I have directed? I beg you
                    earnestly to put up round the feet of my statue my little dog, and some wreaths,
                    and bottles of perfume, and all the fights of Petraites,<note>See note, p. 91.</note>
                    <pb id="p.139"/> so that your kindness may bring me a life after death; and I
                    want the monument to have a frontage of one hundred feet and to be two hundred
                    feet in depth. For I should like to have all kinds of fruit growing round my
                    ashes, and plenty of vines. It is quite wrong for a man to decorate his house
                    while he is alive, and not to trouble about the house where he must make a
                    longer stay. So above all things I want added to the inscription, 'This monument
                    is not to descend to my heir.' I shall certainly take care to provide in my will
                    against any injury being done to me when I am dead. I am appointing one of the
                    freedmen to be caretaker of the tomb and prevent the common people from running
                    up and defiling it. I beg you to put ships in full sail on the monument, and me

                    with a waistband on; and my dear little boy, and big jars sealed with gypsum, so

                    carefully whether this in scription seems to you quite appropriate: 'Here lieth

                        to retain their old master's name on transfer in order to prevent confusion
                        arising from similarities in their names where they were very
                    numerous.</note> The degree of Priest of Augustus was conferred upon him in his
                    absence. He might have been attendant on any magistrate in Rome, but refused
                        it.<note>Trimalchio boasts that if he had chosen to go to Rome as a freedman
                        he could have become a member of the decuries, the orders or guilds which
                        supplied the lower branches of the public service, e.g. lictors, scribes,
                        criers, and street officers.</note> God-fearing, gallant, constant, he
                    started with very little and left thirty millions. He never listened to a

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/>After saying this, Trimalchio began to weep floods
                of tears. Fortunata wept, Habinnas wept, and then all the slaves began as if they
                had been invited to his funeral, and filled the dining-room with lamentation. I had
                even begun to lift up my voice myself, when Trimalchio said, <quote>Well, well, if
                    we know we must die, why should we not live? As I hope for your happiness, let
                    us jump into a bath. My life on it, you will never regret it. It is as hot as a

                follow Trimalchio, who was clapping his hands.</p>
            <p>I looked at Ascyltos and said, <quote>What do you think? I shall die on the spot at

                agreed, and Giton led us through the gallery to the door, where the dog on the chain
                welcomed us with such a noise that Ascyltos fell straight into the fish-pond. As I,
                who had been terrified even of a painted dog, was drunk too, I fell into the same
                abyss while I was helping him in his struggles to swim. But the porter saved us by
                intervening to pacify the dog, and pulled us shivering on to dry land. Giton had
                ransomed himself from the dog some time before by a very cunning plan; when it
                barked he threw it all the pieces we had given him at dinner, and food distracted
                the beast from his anger. But when, chilled to the bone, we asked the porter at
                least to let us out of the door, he replied, <quote>You are wrong if you suppose you
                    can go out at the door you came in by. None of the guests are ever let out by

                a new labyrinth, and the idea of washing had begun to grow pleasant, so we asked him
                instead to show us the bath, and after throwing off our clothes, which Giton began
                to dry in the front hall, we went in. It was a tiny place like a cold-water cistern,
                and Trimalchio was standing upright in it. We were not allowed to escape his filthy
                bragging even there; he declared that there was nothing nicer than washing out of a
                crowd, and told us that there had once been a bakery on that very spot. He then
                became tired and sat down, and the echoes of the bathroom encouraged him to open his
                tipsy jaws to the ceiling and begin to murder Menecrates's songs,<note>Menecrates

                obstreperous laughter at the top of their voices. Some again had their hands tied
                behind their backs and tried to pick up rings from the floor, or knelt down and bent
                their heads backwards and tried to touch the tips of their toes. While the others
                were amusing themselves, we went down into a deep bath which was being heated for

            <p>Then, having got rid of the effects of our liquor, we were led into another

                gold settings, and wine being strained through a cloth before our eyes. Then
                Trimalchio said, <quote>Gentlemen, a slave of mine is celebrating his first shave

                sprinkled with pure wine. Further, he changed a ring on to his right hand, and said,
                    <quote>That trumpeter does not give his signal without a reason. Either there
                    must be a fire, or some one close by is just going to give up the ghost. Lord,
                    save us! So anyone who catches the informer shall have a reward.</quote> He had
                scarcely spoken, when the cock was brought in from somewhere near. Trimalchio
                ordered him to be killed and cooked in a saucepan. So he was cut up by the learned
                cook who had made birds and fishes out of a pig a little while before, and thrown
                into a cooking-pot. And while Daedalus took a long<pb id="p.147"/> drink very hot,
                Fortunata ground up pepper in a boxwood mill.</p>
            <p>After the good things were done, Trimalchio looked at the slaves and said, <quote>Why
                    have you not had dinner yet? Be off, and let some others come and wait.</quote>
                So another brigade appeared, and the old lot shouted,<quote>Gaius, good-bye,</quote>
                and the new ones, <quote>Hail! Gaius.</quote> After this, our jollity received its
                first shock; a rather comely boy came in among the fresh waiters, and Trimalchio
                took him and began to kiss him warmly. So Fortunata, to assert her rights at law,
                began to abuse Trimalchio, and called him a dirty disgrace for not behaving himself.
                At last she even added, <quote>You hound.</quote> Her cursing annoyed Trimalchio,
                and he let fly a cup in her face. She shrieked as if her eye had been put out, and
                lifted her trembling hands to her face. Scintilla was frightened too, and shielded
                her quivering friend with her arms. While an officious slave held a cool little jar
                to her cheek, Fortunata leaned over it and began to groan and cry. But Trimalchio
                said, <quote>What is it all about? This chorus-girl has no memory, yet I took her
                    off the sale-platform and made her one of ourselves. But she puffs herself up
                    like a frog, and will not spit for luck; a log she is, not a woman. But if you
                    were born in a slum you cannot sleep in a palace. Damn my soul if I do not
                    properly tame this shameless Cassandra.<note>Cassandra is a type of passion, and
                        a Cassandra in topboots (<hi rend="italics">caligaria</hi>) is a brutal,
                        strong woman.</note> And I might have married ten million, wretched fool
                    that I was! You know I am speaking the truth. Agatho, the perfumer of the rich
                    woman next door, took me aside and said, 'I entreat you not to let your family
                    die out.' But I, being a good chap, didn't wish to<pb id="p.149"/> seem fickle,
                    and so I have stuck the axe into my own leg. Very well, I will make you want to
                    dig me up with your finger-nails. But you shall understand what you have done
                    for yourself straight away. Habinnas, do not put any statue of her on my tomb,
                    or I shall have nagging even when I am dead. And to show that I can do her a bad
                    turn, I will not have her kiss me even when I am laid out.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="75"/>After this flash of lightning Habinnas began to
                implore him to moderate his wrath. <quote>We all have our faults,</quote> he said,
                    <quote>we are men, not angels.</quote> Scintilla cried and said the same, called
                him Gaius and besought him by his guardian angel to unbend. Trimalchio no longer
                restrained his tears, and said, <quote>Habinnas, please, as you hope to enjoy your
                    money, spit in my face if I have done anything wrong. I kissed that excellent
                    boy not because he is beautiful, but because he is excellent: he can do division
                    and read books at sight, he has bought a suit of Thracian armour out of his
                    day's wages, purchased a round-backed chair with his own money, and two ladles.
                    Does he not deserve to be treated well by me? But Fortunata will not have it. Is
                    that your feeling, my high-heeled hussy? I advise you to chew what you have
                    bitten off, you vulture, and not make me show my teeth, my little dear:
                    otherwise you shall know what my anger is. Mark my words: when once my mind is
                    made up, the thing is fixed with a ten-inch nail. But we will think of the
                    living. Please make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. I was once just what you
                    are, but by my own merits I have come to this. A bit of sound sense is what
                    makes men; the rest is all rubbish. 'I buy well and sell well': some people will
                    tell you differently. I am bursting with happiness.<pb id="p.151"/> What, you
                    snorer in bed, are you still whining? I will take care that you have something
                    to whine over. Well, as I was just saying, self-denial has brought me into this
                    fortune. When I came from Asia I was about as tall as this candle-stick. In fact
                    I used to measure myself by it every day, and grease my lips from the lamp to
                    grow a moustache the quicker. Still, I was my master's favourite for fourteen
                    years. No disgrace in obeying your master's orders. Well, I used to amuse my
                    mistress too. You know what I mean; I say no more, I am not a conceited man.
                        <milestone unit="section" n="76"/>Then, as the Gods willed, I became the real master of the
                    house, and simply had his brains in my pocket. I need only add that I was joint
                    residuary legatee with Caesar,<note>It was not uncommon, and often prudent, for
                        a rich man under the early Empire to mention the Emperor in his will.</note>
                    and came into an estate fit for a senator. But no one is satisfied with nothing.
                    I conceived a passion for business. I will not keep you a moment&mdash; I
                    built five ships, got a cargo of wine&mdash;which was worth its weight in
                    gold at the time&mdash;and sent them to Rome. You may think it was a put-up
                    job; every one was wrecked, truth and no fairy-tales. Neptune gulped down thirty
                    million in one day. Do you think I lost heart? Lord! no, I no more tasted my
                    loss than if nothing had happened. I built some more, bigger, better and more
                    expensive, so that no one could say I was not a brave man. You know, a huge ship
                    has a certain security about her. I got another cargo of wine, bacon, beans,
                    perfumes, and slaves. Fortunata did a noble thing at that time; she sold all her
                    jewellery and all her clothes, and put a hundred gold pieces into my hand. They
                    were the leaven of my fortune. What God wishes soon happens. I made<pb
                        id="p.153"/> a clear ten million on one voyage. I at once bought up all the
                    estates which had belonged to my patron. I built a house, and bought slaves and
                    cattle; whatever I touched grew like a honey-comb. When I came to have more than
                    the whole revenues of my own country, I threw up the game: I retired from active
                    work and began to finance freedmen. I was quite unwilling to go on with my work
                    when I was encouraged by an astrologer who happened to come to our town, a
                    little Greek called Serapa, who knew the secrets of the Gods. He told me things
                    that I had forgotten myself; explained everything from needle and thread
                    upwards; knew my own inside, and only fell short of telling me what I had had
                    for dinner the day before.<milestone unit="section" n="77"/> You would have
                    thought he had always lived with me. You remember, Habinnas?&mdash;I believe
                    you were there?&mdash; 'You fetched your wife from you know where. You are
                    not lucky in your friends. No one is ever as grateful to you as you deserve. You
                    are a man of property. You are nourishing a viper in your bosom,' and, though I
                    must not tell you this, that even now I had thirty years four months and two
                    days left to live. Moreover I shall soon come into an estate. My oracle tells me
                    so. If I could only extend my boundaries to Apulia I should have gone far enough
                    for my lifetime. Meanwhile I built this house while Mercury watched over
                        me.<note>Mercury was Trimalchio's patron. See note, p. 43. Also he was the
                        god of gain and good luck.</note> As you know, it was a tiny place; now it
                    is a palace. It has four dining-rooms, twenty bedrooms, two marble colonnades,
                    an upstairs diningroom, a bedroom where I sleep myself, this viper's boudoir, an
                    excellent room for the porter; there is<pb id="p.155"/> plenty of spare room for
                    guests. In fact when Scaurus came he preferred staying here to anywhere else,
                    and he has a family place by the sea. There are plenty of other things which I
                    will show you in a minute. Take my word for it; if you have a penny, that is
                    what you are worth; by what a man hath shall he be reckoned. So your friend who
                    was once a worm is now a king. Meanwhile, Stichus, bring me the graveclothes in
                    which I mean to be carried out. And some ointment, and a mouthful out of that
                    jar which has to be poured over my bones.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="78"/>In a moment Stichus had fetched a white
                windingsheet and dress into the dining-room and . . . [Trimalchio] asked us to feel
                whether they were made of good wool. Then he gave a little laugh and said,
                    <quote>Mind neither mouse nor moth corrupts them, Stichus; otherwise I will burn
                    you alive. I want to be carried out in splendour, so that the whole crowd calls
                    down blessings on me.</quote> He immediately opened a flask and anointed us all
                and said, <quote>I hope I shall like this as well in the grave as I do on
                earth.</quote> Besides this he ordered wine to be poured into a bowl, and
                    said,<quote>Now you must imagine you have been asked to my funeral.</quote></p>
            <p>The thing was becoming perfectly sickening, when Trimalchio, now deep in the most
                vile drunkenness, had a new set of performers, some trumpeters, brought into the
                dining-room, propped himself on a heap of cushions, and stretched himself on his
                death-bed, saying, <quote>Imagine that I am dead. Play something pretty.</quote> The
                trumpeters broke into a loud funeral march. One man especially, a slave of the
                undertaker who was the most decent man in the party, blew such a mighty blast that
                the whole neighbourhood was<pb id="p.157"/> roused. The watch,<note>Either a
                    municipal or a private brigade of firemen or watchmen.</note> who were
                patrolling the streets close by, thought Trimalchio's house was alight, and suddenly
                burst in the door and began with water and axes to do their duty in creating a
                disturbance. My friends and I seized this most welcome opportunity, outwitted
                Agamemnon, and took to our heels as quickly as if there were a real fire.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="79"/>There was no guiding torch to show us the way as we
                wandered; it was now midnight, and the silence gave us no prospect of meeting anyone
                with a light. Moreover we were drunk, and our ignorance of the quarter would have
                puzzled us even in the daytime. So after dragging our bleeding feet nearly a whole
                hour over the flints and broken pots which layout in the road, we were at last put
                straight by Giton's cleverness. The careful child had been afraid of losing his way
                even in broad daylight, and had marked all the posts and columns with chalk; these
                lines shone through the blackest night, and their brilliant whiteness directed our
                lost footsteps. But even when we reached our lodgings our agitation was not
                relieved. For our friend the old woman had had a long night swilling with her
                lodgers, and would not have noticed if you had set a light to her. We might have had
                to sleep on the doorstep if Trimalchio's courier had not come up in state with ten
                carts. After making a noise for a little while he broke down the house-door and let
                us in by it. . .</p>
            <p>Ah! gods and goddesses, what a night that was, how soft was the bed. We lay in a warm
                embrace and with kisses everywhere made exchange of our wandering spirits. Farewell,
                all earthly troubles. So began my destruction.</p>
            <pb id="p.159"/>
            <p>I blessed my luck too soon. I was overcome with drink and let my shaking hands fall,
                and then Ascyltos, that fountain of all wickedness, took my little friend away et in
                lectum transtulit suum, volutatusque liberius cum fratre non suo, sive non sentiente
                iniuriam sive dissimulante, indormivit alienis amplexibus oblitus iuris humani.
                Itaque ego ut experrectus pertrectavi gaudio despoliatum torum . . . Si qua est
                amantibus fides, ego dubitavi, an utrumque traicerem gladio somnumque morti
                iungerem. Tutius dein secutus consilium Gitona quidem verberibus excitavi, I looked
                angrily at Ascyltos and said, As you have wickedly broken our agreement and the
                friendship between us, collect your things at once, and find some other place to
                corrupt."</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="80"/>He did not resist, but after we had divided our
                spoils with scrupulous honesty he said, And now we must divide the boy too." I
                thought this was a parting joke. But he drew his sword murderously, and
                    said,<quote>You shall not enjoy this treasure that you brood over all alone. I
                    am rejected, but I must carve off my share too, even with this sword.</quote></p>
            <p>So I did the same on my side; wrapped my cloak round my arm and put myself in
                position for a fight. As we raved in folly, the poor boy touched our knees, and
                humbly besought us with tears not to let that quiet lodging-house be the scene of a
                Theban duel, or stain the sanctity of a beautiful friendship with each other's
                blood. <quote>But if you must commit your crime,</quote> he cried, <quote>look here,
                    here is my throat. Turn your hands this way and imbrue your blades. I deserve to
                    die for breaking the oath of friendship.</quote> We put up our swords at his
                prayers, and Ascyltos spoke first, I will put an end to this quarrel. Let the boy
                    follow<pb id="p.161"/> the one he prefers, so that he at any rate may have a
                free choice of brothers."</p>
            <p>I had no fears, imagining that long-standing familiarity had passed into a tie of
                blood, and I accepted the arrangement in hot haste, and referred the dispute to the
                judge. He did not even pretend to take time to consider, but got up at once as I
                finished speaking, and chose Ascyltos for his brother. I was thunderstruck at his
                choice, and fell down on the bed just as I was, without my sword; I should have
                committed suicide at the sentence if I had not grudged my enemy this triumph.
                Ascyltos went stalking out with his winnings, and left his comrade, whom he had
                loved a little while before, and whose fortunes had been so like his own, in despair
                in a strange place.</p>
            <p>The name of friendship endures so long as there is profit in it: the counter on the
                board plays a changeable game. While my luck holds you give me your smiles, my

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/>But still I did not spend much time in weeping. I
                was afraid that Menelaus the tutor<note>See p. 37 note.</note> might increase my
                troubles by finding me alone in the lodgings, so I got together my bundles and took
                a room in a remote place right on the beach. I shut myself up there for three days;
                I was haunted by the thought that I was deserted and despised; I beat my breast,
                already worn with blows, groaned deeply and even cried aloud many<pb id="p.163"/>
                times, Could not the earth have opened and swallowed me, or the sea that shows her
                anger even against the innocent? I fled from justice, I cheated the ring, I killed
                my host, and with all these badges of courage I am left forsaken in lodgings in a
                Greek town, a beggar and an exile. And who condemned me to loneliness? A young man
                tainted by excess of every kind, deserving banishment even by his own admission, a
                free, yes, a free-born debauchee; his youth was wasted in gambling, and even those
                who supposed him to be a man treated him like a girl. And his friend? A boy who went
                into skirts instead of trousers, whose mother persuaded him never to grow up, who
                was the common sport of the slaves' quarters, who after going bankrupt, and changing
                the tune of his vices, has broken the ties of an old friendship, and shamelessly
                sold everything in a single night's work like a common woman. Now the lovers lie all
                night long in each other's arms, and very likely laugh at my loneliness when they
                are tired out. But they shall suffer for it. I am no man, and no free citizen, if I
                do not avenge my wrongs with their hateful blood."</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="82"/>With these words I put on my sword, and recruited
                my strength with a square meal to prevent my losing the battle through weakness. I
                rushed out of doors at once, and went round all the arcades like a madman. My face
                was as of one dumb foundered with fury, I thought of nothing but blood and
                slaughter, and kept putting my hand to the sword-hilt which I had consecrated to the
                work. Then a soldier, who may have been a swindler or a footpad, noticed me, and
                said, Hullo, comrade, what regiment and company do you belong to?" I lied stoutly

                went back to the inn, and by degrees my courage cooled, and I began to bless the

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="83"/>I came into a gallery hung with a wonderful
                collection of various pictures. I saw the works of Zeuxis not yet overcome by the
                defacement of time, and I studied with a certain terrified wonder the rough drawings
                of Protogenes, which rivalled the truth of Nature herself. But when I came to the
                work of Apelles the Greek which is called the One-legged, I positively worshipped
                it. For the outlines of his figures were defined with such subtle accuracy, that you
                would have declared that he had painted their souls as well. In one the eagle was
                carrying the Shepherd of Ida<note>Ganymede, who became the cupbearer of
                Jupiter.</note> on high to heaven, and in another fair Hylas resisted a tormenting
                Naiad. Apollo<note>Apollo killed Hyacinthus, a Spartan boy whom he loved, by a

                with the newborn flower. I cried out as if I were in a desert, among these faces of
                mere painted lovers, <quote>So even<pb id="p.167"/> the gods feel love. Jupiter in
                    his heavenly home could find no object for his passion, and came down on earth
                    to sin, yet did no one any harm. The Nymph who ravished Hylas would have
                    restrained her passion had she believed that Hercules would come to dispute her
                    claim. Apollo recalled the ghost of a boy into a flower, and all the stories
                    tell of love's embraces without a rival. But I have taken for my comrade a
                    friend more cruel than Lycurgus himself.</quote></p>
            <p>Suddenly, as I strove thus with the empty air, a white-haired old
                man<note>Eumolpus.</note> came into the gallery. His face was troubled, but there
                seemed to be the promise of some great thing about him; though he was shabby in
                appearance, so that it was quite plain by this characteristic that he was a man of
                letters, of the kind that rich men hate. He came and stood by my side. . . .</p>

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="89"/>"But I see your whole attention is riveted on that
                picture, which represents the fall of Troy. Well, I will try and explain the
                situation in verse:</p>
            <p>"'It was now the tenth harvest of the siege of the Trojans, who were worn with
                anxious fear, and the honour of Calchas the prophet stood wavering in dark dread,
                when at Apollo's bidding the wooded peaks of Ida were felled and dragged down, and
                the sawn<pb id="p.177"/> planks fitted to a shape that resembled a war-horse. Within
                it a great hollow was opened, and a hidden cave that could shelter a host. In this
                the warriors who chafed at a war ten years long were packed away; the baleful Greeks
                fill every corner, and lie waiting in their own votive offering. Ah! my country! we
                thought the thousand ships were beaten off, and the land released from strife. The
                inscription carved on the horse, and Sinon's crafty bearing, and his mind ever
                powerful for evil, all strengthened our hope.</p>
            <p>Now a crowd hurries from the gate to worship, careless and free of the war. Their
                cheeks are wet with tears, and the joy of their trembling souls brings to their eyes
                tears that terror had banished. Laocoon, priest of Neptune, with hair unbound, stirs
                the whole assembly to cry aloud. He drew back his spear arid the belly of the horse,
                but fate stayed his hand, spear leaped back, and won us to trust the fraud. But he
                nerved his feeble hand a second time, and sounded the deep sides of the horse with
                an axe. The young soldiers shut within breathed loud, and while the sound lasted the
                wooden mass gasped with a terror that was not its own. The prisoned warriors went
                forward to make Troy prisoner, and waged all the war by a new subtlety.</p>
            <p>"'There followed further portents; where the steep ridge of Tenedos breaks the sea,
                the billows rise and swell, and the shattered wave leaps back hollowing the calm,
                sounding like the noise of oars borne far through the silent night, when ships bear
                down the ocean, and the calm is stirred and splashes under the burden of the keel.
                We look back: the tide carries two coiling snakes towards the rocks, their swollen
                    breasts<pb id="p.179"/> like tall ships throwing the foam from their sides.
                Their tails crash through the sea, their crests move free over the open water,
                fierce as their eyes; a brilliant beam kindles the waves, and the waters resound
                with their hissing. Our heartbeats stopped. The priests stood wreathed for sacrifice
                with the two sons of Laocoon in Phrygian raiment. Suddenly the gleaming snakes twine
                their bodies round them. The boys throw up their little hands to their faces,
                neither helping himself, but each his brother: such was the exchange of love, and
                death himself slew both poor children by their unselfish fear. Then before our eyes
                the father, a feeble helper, laid his own body down upon his children's. The snakes,
                now gorged with death, attacked the man and dragged his limbsto the ground. The
                priest lies a victim before his altars and beats the earth. Thus the doomed city of
                Troy first lost her gods by profaning their worship.</p>
            <p><quote>'Now Phoebe at the full lifted up her white beam, and led forth the smaller
                    stars with her glowing torch, and the Greeks unbarred the horse, and poured out
                    their warriors among Priam's sons drowned in darkness and wine. The leaders try
                    their strength in arms, as a steed untied from the Thessalian yoke will toss his
                    head and lofty mane as he rushes forth. They draw their swords, brandish their
                    shields, and begin the fight. One slays Trojans heavy with drink, and prolongs
                    their sleep to death that endeth all, another lights torches from the altars,
                    and calls on the holy places of Troy to fight against the Trojans.'</quote> . .

                said that I was wrong to rebuke my elders, and forget my duty so far as to spoil
                with my insults the dinner I had ordered out of kindness, with much more tolerant
                and modest advice which well became his beautiful self. . .</p>

            <p>That soldier who took away my sword did Eumolpus a good turn too; otherwise I would
                have appeased the wrath raised in me against Ascyltos with the blood of Eumolpus.
                Giton was not blind to this. So he went out of the room on a pretence of fetching
                water, and<pb id="p.189"/> quenched my wrath by his tactful departure. Then, as my
                fury cooled a little, I said, <quote>I would prefer even that you should talk poetry
                    now, Eumolpus, rather than harbour such hopes. I am choleric, and you are
                    lecherous: you understand that these dispositions do not suit each other. Well,
                    regard me as a maniac, yield to my infirmity, in short, get out quick.</quote>
                Eumolpus was staggered by this attack, and never asked why I was angry, but went out
                of the room at once and suddenly banged the door, taking me completely by surprise
                and shutting me in. He pulled out the key in a moment and ran off to look for Giton.</p>
            <p>I was locked in. I made up my mind to hang myself and die. I had just tied a belt to
                the frame of a bed which stood by the wall, and was pushing my neck into the noose,
                when the door was unlocked, Eumolpus came in with Giton, and called me back to light
                from the very bourne of death. Nay, Giton passed from grief to raving madness, and
                raised a shout, pushed me with both hands and threw me on the bed, and
                    cried,<quote>Encolpius, you are wrong if you suppose you could possibly die
                    before me. I thought of suicide first; I looked for a sword in Ascyltos's
                    lodgings. If I had not found you I would have hurled myself to death over a
                    precipice. I will show you that death stands close by those who seek him: behold
                    in your turn the scene you wished me to behold.</quote></p>
            <p>With these words he snatched a razor from Eumolpus's servant, drew it once, twice
                across his throat, and tumbled down at our feet. I gave a cry of horror, rushed to
                him as he fell, and sought the road of death with the same steel. But Giton was not
                marked with any trace of a wound, and I did not feel the least pain. The razor was
                untempered, and specially blunted<pb id="p.191"/> in order to give boy pupils the
                courage of a barber: and so it had grown a sheath. So the servant had not been
                alarmed when the steel was snatched from him, and Eumolpus did not interrupt our
                death-scene.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="95"/>While this lover's play was being performed, an
                inmate of the house came in with part of our little dinner, and after looking at us
                rolling in disarray on the ground he said, <quote>Are you drunk, please, or runaway
                    slaves, or both? Who turned the bed up there, and what do all these sneaking
                    contrivances mean? I declare you meant to run off in the dark into the public
                    street rather than pay for your room. But you shall pay for it. I will teach you
                    that these lodgings do not belong to a poor widow, but to Marcus Mannicius.</quote>
                <quote>What?</quote> shouted Eumolpus, "you dare threaten us.' And as he spoke he
                struck the man in the face with all the force of his outstretched hand. The man
                hurled a little earthenware pot, which was empty, all the guests having drunk from
                it, at Eumolpus's head, broke the skin of his forehead in the midst of his clamour,
                and rushed out of the room. Eumolpus would not brook an insult; he seized a wooden
                candlestick and followed the lodger out, and avenged his bloody forehead with a rain
                of blows. All the household ran up, and a crowd of drunken lodgers. I had a chance
                of punishing Eumolpus, and I shut him out, and so got even with the bully, and of
                course had the room and my sleep to myself without a rival.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile cooks and lodgers be laboured him now that he was locked out, and one
                thrust a spit full of hissing meat into his eyes, another took a fork from a dresser
                and struck a fighting attitude. Above all, a blear-eyed old woman with a very dirty
                linen wrap round her. balancing herself on an uneven pair of<pb id="p.193"/> clogs,
                took the lead, brought up a dog of enormous size on a chain, and set him on to
                Eumolpus. But the candlestick was enough to protect him from all danger.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="96"/>We saw everything through a hole in the folding
                doors, which had been made by the handle of the door being broken a short time
                before; and I was delighted to see him thrashed. But Giton clung to compassion, and
                said we ought to open the door and go and rescue him from peril. My indignation was
                still awake; I did not hold my hand, I rapped his compassionate head with my sharp
                clenched knuckles. He cried and sat down on the bed. I put my eyes to the chink by
                turns, and gorged myself on the miseries of Eumolpus like a dainty dish, and
                approved their prolongation. Then Bargates, the man in charge of the lodging-house,
                was disturbed at his dinner, and two chairmen carried him right into the brawl; for
                he had gouty feet. In a furious vulgar voice he made a long oration against
                drunkards and escaped slaves, and then he looked at Eumolpus and said, <quote>What,
                    most learned bard, was it you? Getaway quick, you damned slaves, and keep your
                    hands from quarrelling.</quote>. .</p>

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="97"/>While Eumolpus was talking privately to Bargates, a
                crier came into the house with a municipal slave and quite a small crowd of other
                people, shook a torch which gave out more smoke than light, and made this
                proclamation: "Lost recently in the public baths, a boy aged about sixteen, hair
                curly, low habits, of attractive appearance, answers to the name of Giton. A reward
                of a thousand pieces will be paid to any person willing to bring him back or
                indicate his where<pb id="p.195"/> abouts." Ascyltos stood close by the crier in
                clothes of many colours, holding out the reward on a silver dish to prove his
                honesty. I told Giton to get under the bed at once, and hook his feet and hands into
                the webbing which held up the mattress on the frame, so that he might evade the
                grasp of searchers by staying stretched out under the bed, just as Ulysses of old
                clung on to the ram of the Cyclops.<note>See Homer's Odyssey, Book ix. Ulysses
                    escaped from the den of the Cyclops Polyphemus by clinging to the belly of a
                    ram, when Polyphemus sent out his flocks to graze.</note> Giton obeyed orders at
                once, and in a second had slipped his hands into the webbing, and surpassed even
                Ulysses at his own tricks. I did not want to leave any room for suspicion, so I
                stuffed the bed with clothes, and arranged them in the shape of a man about my own
                height sleeping by himself.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Ascyltos went round all the rooms with a constable, and when he came to
                mine, his hopes swelled within him at finding the door bolted with especial care.
                The municipal slave put an axe into the joints, and loosened the bolts from their
                place. I fell at Ascyltos's feet, and besought him, by the memory of our friendship
                and the miseries we had shared, at least to show me my brother. Further to win
                belief in my sham prayers, I said, <quote>I know you have come to kill me, Ascyltos.
                    Else why have you brought an axe with you? Well, satisfy your rage. Here is my
                    neck, shed my blood, the real object of your pretended legal search.</quote>
                Ascyltos threw off his resentment, and declared that he wanted nothing but his own
                runaway slave, that he did not desire the death of any man or any suppliant, much
                less of one whom he loved very dearly now that their deadly dispute was over.</p>
            <pb id="p.197"/>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="98"/>But the constable was not so deficient in energy.
                He took a cane from the inn-keeper, and pushed it under the bed, and poked into
                everything, even the cracks in the walls. Giton twisted away from the stick, drew in
                his breath very gently, and pressed his lips close against the bugs in the bedding.
                . . The broken door of the room could not keep anyone out, and Eumolpus rushed in in
                a fury, and cried, <quote>I have found a thousand pieces; for I mean to follow the
                    crier as he goes away, and betray you as you richly deserve, and tell him that
                    Giton is in your hands.</quote> He persisted, I fell at his feet, besought him
                not to kill a dying man, and said, <quote>You might well be excited if you could
                    show him the lost one. As it is, the boy has run away in the crowd, and I have
                    not the least idea where he has gone. As you love me, Eumolpus, get the boy
                    back, and give him to Ascyltos if you like.</quote> I was just inducing him to
                believe me, when Giton burst with holding his breath, and all at once sneezed three
                times so that he shook the bed. Eumolpus turned round at the noise, and said
                    <quote>Good day, Giton.</quote> He pulled off the mattress, and saw an Ulysses
                whom even a hungry Cyclops might have spared. Then he turned on me, <quote>Now, you
                    thief; you did not dare to tell me the truth even when you were caught. In fact,
                    unless the God who controls man's destiny had wrung a sign from this boy as he
                    hung there, I should now be wandering round the pot-houses like a fool.</quote>
                . . .</p>
            <p>Giton was far more at ease than I. He first stanched a cut which had been made on
                Eumolpus's forehead with spider's webs soaked in oil. He then took off his torn
                clothes, and in exchange gave him a short cloak of his own, then put his arms round
                him, for<pb id="p.199"/> he was now softening, poulticed him with kisses, and said,
                    <quote>Dearest father, we are in your hands, yours entirely. If you love your
                    Giton, make up your mind to save him. I wish the cruel fire might engulf me
                    alone, or the wintry sea assail me. I am the object of all his transgressions, I
                    am the cause. If I were gone, you two might patch up your quarrel.</quote> . .</p>

            <p>I burst into tears, and begged and prayed him to be friends again with me too: a true
                lover was incapable of mad jealousy. At the same time I would take care to do
                nothing more in word or deed by which he could possibly be hurt. Only he must remove
                all irritation from his mind like a man of true culture and leave no scar. <quote>On

                knock sounded on the door, and a sailor with a straggly beard stood at the entrance
                and said, <quote>You hang about, Eumolpus, as if you did not know a Blue Peter by
                    sight.</quote> We all got up in a hurry, and Eumolpus ordered his slave, who had
                now been asleep for some time, to come out with his baggage. Giton and I put

                These manly tones were somehow familiar to my ear, and my heart beat fast as they

            <p>Eumolpus was overwhelmed by this attack, and swore by gods and goddesses that he did
                not understand what had happened, and had no sinister intentions in his mind, but
                had taken us to share the voyage with him in perfect honesty and absolute good
                faith; he had been meaning to sail himself some time before. <quote>Is there any
                    trap here?</quote> he said, <quote>and who is the Hannibal we have on board?
                    Lichas of Tarentum is a respectable person. He is not only owner and captain of
                    this ship, but has several estates and some slaves in business. He is carrying a
                    cargo consigned to a market. This is the ogre and pirate king to whom we owe our
                    passage; and besides, there is Tryphaena, loveliest of women, who sails from one
                    place to another in search of pleasure.</quote>
                <quote>But it is these two we are running away from,</quote> said Giton, and poured
                out the story of our feud, and explained our imminent danger, till Eumolpus shook.
                He became muddled and helpless, and asked us each to put forward our views. <quote>I
                    would have you imagine that we have entered the ogre's den,</quote> he said.

                    and he will do you a favour.</quote> Eumolpus declared that this was impossible:
                    <quote>These large boats only steer into landlocked harbours, and it is
                    incredible that our brother should collapse so soon. Besides, Lichas may perhaps
                    ask to see the sick man as a matter of kindness. You realize what a fine turn we
                    should do ourselves by leading the master up to his runaways with our own hands.
                    But supposing the ship could be turned aside from her long passage, and Lichas

                    without being seen by every one? Cover our heads, or bare them? Cover them, and
                    every one will want to lend his arm to the poor sick man! Bare them, that is
                    nothing more or less than proscribing ourselves.</quote><milestone

                    invite Eumolpus to share the risk. It is not fair to load an innocent person
                    with another's troubles. I am satisfied if chance will help us to get down.</quote>
                <quote>It is a clever plan,</quote> said Eumolpus, if there were any way of starting
                it. But every one will see you going: especially the helmsman, who watches all night
                long, and keeps guard even over the motions of the stars. Of course you might elude
                his unsleeping watchfulness, if you wanted to escape off another part of the ship;
                but as it is, you want to slip off the stern close to the helm itself, where the
                rope which<pb id="p.207"/> holds the boat safe hangs just by, Again, I am surprised
                that it did not occur to you, Encolpius, that one sailor is always on duty night and
                day lying in the boat, and you cannot turn this sentry out except by killing him, or
                throw him out except by force. You must ask your own bold heart whether that can be
                done. As far as my coming with you goes, I do not shirk any danger which offers a
                chance of safety. But I suppose that even you do not wish to squander your lives
                like a vain trifle without any reason. Now see whether you approve of this. I will
                roll you in two bales, tie you up, and put you among my clothes as luggage, of
                course leaving the ends a bit open, so that you can get your breath and your food.
                Then I will raise the cry that my slaves have jumped overboard in the dark, being
                afraid of some heavier punishment. Then after we have arrived in harbour, I will
                carry you out like baggage without arousing any suspicion."</p>

                    long get creased and spoilt, and papers in bundles lose their shape. Are we

                    cloths as if we were statues?. . . No, we still have to find some way of
                    salvation. Look at what I thought of. Eumolpus, as a man of learning,<pb

                    ourselves, hair, nails, everything. Then we will stand by you with pleasure like
                    Aethiopian slaves, without undergoing any tortures, and our change of colour

                    when it takes a number of points in unison to make a good lie. Suppose the stain
                    of dye on the face could last for some time; imagine that never a drop of water
                    could make any mark on our skins, nor our clothes stick to the ink, which often
                    clings to us without the use of any cement: but, tell me, can we make our lips
                    swell to a hideous thickness? Or transform our hair with curling-tongs? Or
                    plough up our foreheads with scars? Or walk bow-legged? Or bend our ankles over
                    to the ground? Or trim our beards in a foreign cut? Artificial colours dirty
                    one's body without altering it. Listen, I have thought of this in desperation.
                    Let us tie our heads in our clothes, and plunge into the deep.</quote></p>

                    that you look like slaves punished by branding. These letters will divert
                    inquisitive people's suspicions, and at the same time conceal your faces with
                    the shadow of punishment.</quote> We tried the trick at once, and walked
                cautiously to the side of the ship, and yielded up our heads and eyebrows to the
                barber to be shorn. Eumolpus covered both our foreheads with enormous letters, and
                scrawled the usual mark of runaway slaves all over our faces with a generous hand.
                But one of the passengers, who was extremely seasick, happened to be leaning over
                the side of the ship to relieve his stomach, and observed the barber in the
                moonlight busy with his ill-timed work. The man cursed this for an omen, because it
                looked like the last offering of a doomed crew, and then threw himself back into his
                bunk. We pretended not to hear his puking curses, and went on with the gloomy
                business, and then lay down in silence and passed the remaining hours of the night

                speech Lichas fired up in alarm, and said, <quote>What, has anyone cut his hair on

                    want to know who is to be punished to give us a clear voyage.</quote>
                <quote>Oh,</quote> said Eumolpus, <quote>I gave those orders. I was not doing
                    anything unlucky, considering that I had to share the voyage myself. It was
                    because these ruffians had long, dirty hair. I did not want to turn the ship
                    into a prison, so I ordered the filth to be cleared off the brutes. Besides, I
                    did not want the marks of branding to be screened and covered by their hair.
                    They ought to show at full length for every one to read. Furthermore, they
                    squandered my money on a certain lady friend of ours; I pulled them away from
                    her the night before, reeking with wine and scent. In fact, they still stink of
                    the shreds of my inheritance.</quote></p>
            <p>So it was decided that forty stripes should be inflicted on each of us to appease the
                guardian angel of the ship. Not a moment was lost; the angry sailors advanced upon
                us with ropes-ends, and tried to soften their guardian angel's heart with our
                miserable blood. For my part I bore three full blows with Spartan pride. But Giton
                cried out so lustily the moment he was touched, that his familiar voice filled
                Tryphaena's ears. Not only was the lady in a flutter, but all her maids were drawn
                by the well-known tones, and came running to the victim. Giton's loveliness had
                    already<pb id="p.215"/> disarmed the sailors; even without speaking he appealed
                to his tormentors. Then all the maids screamed out together: <quote>It is Giton, it
                    is; stop beating him, you monsters. Help, ma'am, Giton is here.</quote>
                Tryphaena had already convinced herself, and inclined her ear to them, and flew on
                wings to the boy. Lichas, who knew me intimately, ran up as though he had heard my

                face and body was disguised. Tryphaena, thinking that the marks on our foreheads
                were real prisoners' brands, cried bitterly over our supposed punishment, and began
                to inquire more gently what prison had stayed us in our wanderings, and what hand
                had been so ruthless as to inflict such marks upon us. <quote>But, of

            <p>Tryphaena besought him to have pity, because she had not lost all her desire for
                Giton, but the seduction<pb id="p.217"/> of his wife and the insults offered to him
                in the Porch of Hercules were still in Lichas's mind, and he cried out with a look
                of still more profound agitation, <quote>Tryphaena, I believe you admit that the
                    Gods in Heaven take some trouble about men's affairs. They brought these sinners
                    on board my boat without their knowledge, and told us what they had done by a
                    coincidence in dreams. Then do consider; how can we possibly pardon people whom
                    a God himself has handed over to us for punishment? I am not a bloodthirsty man,
                    but personally I am afraid that if I let them off anything it will fall on
                me.</quote> Tryphaena veered round at this appeal to superstition, declined to
                interfere with the punishment, and declared that she approved of this most proper
                vengeance. She had been just as gravely wronged as Lichas, considering that her
                reputation for chastity had been publicly impugned. . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="107"/><quote>I believe I am a man of some reputation,
                    and they have chosen me for this duty, and begged me to make it up between them
                    and their old friends. I suppose you do not imagine that these young men have
                    fallen into the snare by chance, when the first care of every one who goes a
                    voyage is to find a trustworthy person to depend on. So unbend the sternness
                    which has been softened by revenge, and let the men go free without hindrance to
                    their destination. Even a harsh and unforgiving master reins in his cruelty if
                    his runaways are at last led back by penitence, and we all spare an enemy who
                    surrenders. What do you want or wish for more? These free and respectable young
                    men lie prostrate before your eyes, and what is more important, they were once
                    bound to you by close friendship I take my oath that if they had embezzled your

                    be satisfied with the punishment you have seen inflicted. Look, you see slavery
                    on their foreheads, and their free faces branded under a selfimposed sentence of
                    punishment.</quote> Lichas interrupted this plea for mercy, saying, <quote>Do
                    not go confusing the issue, but let each single point have its place. And first
                    of all, if they came of their own accord, why have they stripped all the hair
                    off their heads? A man who disguises himself wants to play a trick, not to make
                    amends. Again, if they were contriving some act of grace through a mediator, why
                    did you do everything in your power to hide your prot&eacute;g&eacute;s
                    away? All this makes it clear that the ruffians fell into the net by accident,
                    and that you hunted for some device to avoid the force of our displeasure. When
                    you try to prejudice us by calling them free and respectable, mind you do not
                    spoil your case by impudence. What should an injured party do, when the guilty
                    run into punishment? Oh! you say, they were once our friends! Then they deserve
                    the harsher treatment. A person who injures a stranger is called a robber, but a
                    man who hurts his friends is practically a parricide.</quote> Eumolpus put an
                end to this unfair harangue by saying,<quote>I know that nothing is more against the
                    poor young men than their cutting their hair at night. This looks like a proof
                    that they came by chance upon the ship and did not come on purpose. Now I want
                    the plain truth to come to your ears just as simply as it happened. They wanted
                    to relieve their heads of the troublesome and useless weight before they came
                    aboard, but the wind got up and postponed their scheme of treatment. They never
                    thought that it made any difference where they began what they had decided to
                    do; they were quite ignorant of sailors' omens and sea-law.</quote>
                <quote>But<pb id="p.221"/> why should they shave themselves to excite pity?</quote>
                said Lichas, Unless of course bald people are naturally more pitiable. But what is
                the use of trying to discover the truth through a third person? Now speak up, you
                ruffian! Who was the salamander that singed off your eyebrows? What God had the
                promise of your hair? Answer me, gallows-bird!"</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="108"/>I was dumb with terror of being punished, and too
                upset to find a word to say, for the case was only too clear. . . .We were in no
                position to speak, or do anything, for to say nothing of the disgrace of our shaven
                heads, our eyebrows were as bald as our pates. But when a wet sponge was wiped down
                my doleful countenance, and the ink ran over all my face and of course blotted out
                every feature in a cloud of smut, anger passed into loathing. Eumolpus cried out
                that he would not allow anyone to disfigure free young men without right or reason,
                and cut short the angry sailors' threats not only by argument but by force. His
                slave stood by him in his protest, and one or two of the most feeble passengers, who
                rather consoled him for having to fight than increased his strength. For my part I
                shirked nothing. I shook my fist in Tryphaena's face, and declared in a loud open
                voice that I would use violence to her if she did not leave off hurting Giton, for
                she was a wicked woman and the only person on the ship who deserved flogging.
                Lichas's wrath blazed hotter at my daring, and he taunted me with throwing up my own
                case and only shouting for somebody else. Tryphaena was equally hot and angry and
                abusive, and divided the whole ship's company into factions. On our side, the slave
                barber handed out his blades to us, and kept one for himself, on the other side
                Tryphaena's slaves were ready with bare<pb id="p.223"/> fists, and even the cries of
                women were not unheard on the field. The helmsman alone swore that he would give up
                minding the ship if this madness, which had been stirred up to suit a pack of
                scoundrels, did not stop. None the less, the fury of the combatants persisted, the
                enemy fighting for revenge and we for dear life. Many fell on both sides without
                fatal results, still more got bloody wounds and retired in the style of a real
                battle, and still we all raged implacably. Then the gallant Giton turned a razor on
                himself and threatened to put an end to our troubles by self-mutilation, and
                Tryphaena averted the horrible disaster by a fair promise of freedom. I lifted a
                barber's knife to my throat several times, no more meaning to kill myself than Giton
                meant to do what he threatened. Still he filled the tragic part more recklessly,
                because he knew that he was holding the very razor with which he had already made a
                cut on his throat. Both sides were drawn up in battle array, and it was plain that
                the fight would be no ordinary affair, when the helmsman with difficulty induced
                Tryphaena to conclude a treaty like a true diplomat. So the usual formal
                undertakings were exchanged, and she waved an olivebranch which she took from the
                ship's figure-head, and ventured to come up and talk to us: What madness," she
                cried, <quote>is turning peace into war? What have our hands done to deserve it? No

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="109"/>The woman poured out these words in a loud excited
                voice, the fighting died away for a little while, our hands were recalled to the way
                of peace, and dropped the war. Our leader Eumolpus seized the occasion of their
                relenting, and after making a warm attack on Lichas, signed the treaty, which ran as
                    follows:<quote>Agreed on your part, Tryphaena, that you will not complain of any
                    wrong done to you by Giton, and if any has been done to you before this date
                    will not bring it up against him or punish him or take steps to follow it up in
                    any other way whatsoever; that you will give the boy no orders which he
                    dislikes, for a hug, a kiss, or a lover's close embrace, without paying a
                    hundred pieces for it cash down. Furthermore, it is agreed on your part, Lichas,
                    that you will not pursue Encolpius with insulting words or grimaces, nor inquire
                    where he sleeps at night, or if you do inquire will pay two hundred pieces cash
                    down for every injurious act done to him.</quote> Peace was made on these terms,
                and we laid down our arms, and for fear any vestige of anger should be left in our
                minds, even after taking the oath, we decided to wipe out the past with a kiss.
                There was applause all round, our hatred died down, and a feast which had been
                brought for the fight cemented our agreement with joviality. Then the whole ship
                rang with songs; and a sudden calm having stayed us in our course, one man pursued
                the leaping fish with a spear, another pulled in his struggling prey on alluring
                hooks. Besides all this, some sea-birds settled on one of the yards, and a clever
                sportsman took them in with jointed rod of<pb id="p.227"/> rushes; they were snared
                by these limed twigs and brought down into our hands. The breeze caught their
                feathers as they flew, and the light foam lashed their wings as they skimmed the
                sea.</p>
            <p>Lichas was just beginning to be friendly with me again, Tryphaena was just pouring
                the dregs of a drink over Giton, when Eumolpus, who was unsteady with drink himself,
                tried to aim some satire at bald persons and branded criminals, and after exhausting
                his chilly wit, went back to his poetry and began to declaim a little dirge on Hair:</p>
            <p>"The hair that is the whole glory of the body is fallen, dull winter has carried away
                the bright locks of spring. Now the temples are bare of their shade and are
                downcast, and the wide naked space on my old head shines where the hair is worn
                away. Ye Gods that love to cheat us; ye rob us first of the first joys ye gave to
                our youth.</p>
            <p>Poor wretch, a moment ago thy hair shone bright and more beautiful than
                Ph&oelig;bus and the sister of Phoebus. Now thou art smoother than bronze or the
                round garden mushroom that is born in rain, and turnest in dread from a girl's
                mockery. To teach thee how quickly death shall come, know that a part of thine head
                hath died already."</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="110"/>He wanted to produce some more lines even more
                silly than the last, I believe, when Tryphaena's maid took Giton below decks, and
                ornamented the boy's head with some of her mistress's artificial curls. Further, she
                also took some eyebrows out of a box, and by cunningly following the lines where he
                was defaced she restored his proper beauty complete. Tryphaena recognized the true
                Giton, there was a storm of tears, and she then for the first time gave the boy a
                    kiss<pb id="p.229"/> with real affection. Of course, I was glad to see him
                clothed again in his former loveliness, but still I kept hiding my own face
                continually, for I realized that I was marked with no common ugliness, since not
                even Lichas considered me fit to speak to. But the same maid came and rescued me
                from gloom, called me aside, and decked me with equally becoming curls. Indeed, my
                face shone with a greater glory. My curls were golden . . .</p>
            <p>Then Eumolpus, our spokesman in peril and the begetter of our present peace, to save
                our jollity from falling dumb for want of good stories, began to hurl many taunts at
                the fickleness of women; how easily they fell in love, how quickly they forgot even
                their own sons, how no woman was so chaste that she could not be led away into utter
                madness by a passion for a stranger. He was not thinking of old tragedies or names
                notorious in history, but of an affair which happened in his lifetime. He would tell
                it us if we liked to listen. So all eyes and ears were turned upon him, and he began
                as follows:</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="111"/>There was a married woman in Ephesus of such
                famous virtue that she drew women even from the neighbouring states to gaze upon
                her. So when she had buried her husband, the common fashion of following the
                procession with loose hair, and beating the naked breast in front of the crowd, did
                not satisfy her. She followed the dead man even to his resting-place, and began to
                watch and weep night and day over the body, which was laid in an underground vault
                in the Greek fashion. Neither her parents nor her relations could divert her from
                thus torturing herself, and courting death by starvation; the officials were at last
                rebuffed and left her; every one mourned for her as a woman of unique character, and
                she was now<pb id="p.231"/> passing her fifth day without food. A devoted maid sat
                by the failing woman, shed tears in sympathy with her woes, and at the same time
                filled up the lamp, which was placed in the tomb, whenever it sank. There was but
                one opinion throughout the city, every class of person admitting this was the one
                true and brilliant example of chastity and love. At this moment the governor of the
                province gave orders that some robbers should be crucified near the small building
                where the lady was bewailing her recent loss. So on the next night, when the soldier
                who was watching the crosses, to prevent anyone taking down a body for burial,
                observed a light shining plainly among the tombs, and heard a mourner's groans, a
                very human weakness made him curious to know who it was and what he was doing. So he
                went down into the vault, and on seeing a very beautiful woman, at first halted in
                confusion, as if he had seen a portent or some ghost from the world beneath. But
                afterwards noticing the dead man lying there, and watching the woman's tears and the
                marks of her nails on her face, he came to the correct conclusion, that she found
                her regret for the lost one unendurable. He therefore brought his supper into the
                tomb, and began to urge the mourner not to persist in useless grief, and break her
                heart with unprofitable sobs: for all men made the same end and found the same
                resting-place, and so on with the other platitudes which restore wounded spirits to
                health. But she took no notice of his sympathy, struck and tore her breast more
                violently than ever, pulled out her hair, and laid it on the dead body. Still the
                soldier did not retire, but tried to give the poor woman food with similar
                encouragements, until the maid, who was no doubt seduced by the smell of his<pb
                    id="p.233"/> wine, first gave in herself, and put out her hand at his kindly
                invitation, and then, refreshed with food and drink, began to assail her mistress's
                obstinacy, and say, 'What will you gain by all this, if you faint away with hunger,
                if you bury yourself alive, if you breathe out your undoomed soul before Fate calls
                for it?' 'Believest thou that the ashes or the spirit of the buried dead can feel
                thy woe?<note>See Virgil, <hi rend="italics">&AElig;neid</hi> iv, 34.</note>
                Will you not begin life afresh? Will you not shake off this womanish failing, and
                enjoy the blessings of the light so long as you are allowed? Your poor dead
                husband's body here ought to persuade you to keep alive.' People are always ready to
                listen when they are urged to take a meal or to keep alive. So the lady, being
                thirsty after several days' abstinence, allowed her resolution to be broken down,
                and filled herself with food as greedily as the maid, who had been the first to
                yield.</p>

                <quote>Well, you know which temptation generally assails a man on a full stomach.
                    The soldier used the same insinuating phrases which had persuaded the lady to
                    consent to live, to conduct an assault upon her virtue. Her modest eye saw in
                    him a young man, handsome and eloquent. The maid begged her to be gracious, and
                    then said, 'Wilt thou fight love even when love pleases thee? Or dost thou never
                    remember in whose lands thou art resting?'<note>See Virgil, <hi rend="italics">&AElig;neid</hi> iv, 38.</note> I need hide the fact no longer. The
                    lady ceased to hold out, and the conquering hero won her over entire. So they
                    passed not only their wedding night together, but the next and a third, of
                    course shutting the door of the vault, so that any friend or stranger who came
                    to the tomb would imagine that this most virtuous lady had breathed her last
                    over her husband's body. Well, the<pb id="p.235"/> soldier was delighted with
                    the woman's beauty, and his stolen pleasure; he bought up all the fine things
                    his means permitted, and carried them to the tomb the moment darkness fell. So
                    the parents of one of the crucified, seeing that the watch was illkept, took
                    their man down in the dark and administered the last rite to him. The soldier
                    was eluded while he was off duty, and next day, seeing one of the crosses
                    without its corpse, he was in terror of punishment, and explained to the lady
                    what had happened. He declared that he would not wait for a court-martial, but
                    would punish his own neglect with a thrust of his sword. So she had better get
                    ready a place for a dying man, and let the gloomy vault enclose both her husband
                    and her lover. The lady's heart was tender as well as pure. 'Heaven forbid,' she
                    replied, 'that I should look at the same moment on the dead bodies of two men
                    whom I love. No, I would rather make a dead man useful, than send a live man to
                    death.' After this speech she ordered her husband's body to be taken out of the
                    coffin and fixed up on the empty cross. The soldier availed himself of this
                    far-seeing woman's device, and the people wondered the next day by what means
                    the dead man had ascended the cross.</quote>
            </p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="113"/>The sailors received this tale with a roar;
                Tryphaena blushed deeply, and laid her face caressingly on Giton's neck. But there
                was no laugh from Lichas; he shook his head angrily and said: <quote>If the governor
                    of the province had been a just man, he should have put the dead husband back in
                    the tomb, and hung the woman on the cross.</quote></p>
            <p>No doubt he was thinking once more of Hedyle and how his ship had been pillaged on
                her passionate<pb id="p.237"/> elopement. But the terms of our treaty forbade us to
                bear grudges, and the joy which had filled our souls left no room for wrath.
                Tryphaena was now lying in Giton's lap, covering him with kisses one moment, and
                sometimes patting his shaven head. I was gloomy and uneasy about our new terms, and
                did not touch food or drink, but kept shooting angry looks askance at them both.
                Every kiss was a wound to me, every pleasing wile that the wanton woman conjured up.
                I was not yet sure whether I was more angry with the boy for taking away my
                mistress, or with my mistress for leading the boy astray: both of them were hateful
                to my sight and more depressing than the bondage I had escaped. And besides all
                this, Tryphaena did not address me like a friend whom she was once pleased to have
                for a lover, and Giton did not think fit to drink my health in the ordinary way, and
                would not even so much as include me in general conversation. I suppose he was
                afraid of reopening a tender scar just as friendly feeling began to draw it
                together. My unhappiness moved me till tears overflowed my heart, and the groan I
                hid with a sigh almost stole my life away. . .</p>
            <p>He tried to gain admission to share their joys, not wearing the proud look of a

            <p>Nothing troubled me more than the fear that Eumolpus might have got some idea of what
                was going on, and might employ his powers of speech in attacking me in verse. . .</p>
            <p>Eumolpus swore an oath in most formal language. . .</p>
            <pb id="p.239"/>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="114"/>While we talked over this matter and others, the
                sea rose, clouds gathered from every quarter, and overwhelmed the day in darkness.
                The sailors ran to their posts in terror, and furled the sails before the storm. But
                the wind did not drive the waves in any one direction, and the helmsman was at a
                loss which way to steer. One moment the wind set towards Sicily, very often the
                north wind blew off the Italian coast, mastered the ship and twisted her in every
                direction; and what was more dangerous than any squall, such thick darkness had
                suddenly blotted out the light that the steersman could not even see the whole prow.
                Then for a wonder, as the hostile fury of the storm gathered, Lichas trembled and
                stretched out his hands to me imploringly, and said, <quote>Help us in our peril,
                    Encolpius; let the ship have the goddess's robe again and her holy
                        rattle.<note>Sacred emblems of Isis which Encolpius had probably
                    stolen.</note> Be merciful, I implore you, as your way is.</quote></p>
            <p>But even as he shouted the wind blew him into the water, a squall whirled him round
                and round repeatedly in a fierce whirlpool, and sucked him down. Tryphaena's
                faithful slaves carried her off almost by force, put her in a boat with most of her
                luggage, and so rescued her from certain death. . .</p>
            <p>I embraced Giton, and wept and cried aloud: <quote>Did we deserve this from the gods,
                    that they should unite us only when they slay? But cruel Fate does not grant us
                    even this. Look! even now the waves will upset the boat; even now the angry sea
                    will sunder a lover's embrace. So if you ever really loved Encolpius, kiss him
                    while you may, and snatch this last joy as Fate swoops down upon you.</quote> As
                I spoke Giton took<pb id="p.241"/> off his clothes, and I covered him with my shirt
                as he put up his head to be kissed. And that no envious wave should pull us apart as
                we clung to each other, he put his belt round us both and tied it tight,
                    saying,<quote>Whatever happens to us, at least we shall be locked together a
                    long while as the sea carries us, and if the sea has pity and will cast us up on
                    the same shore, some one may come by and put stones over us out of ordinary
                    human kindness, or the last work of the waves even in their wrath will be to
                    cover us with the unconscious sand.</quote> I let him bind me for the last time,
                and then waited, like a man dressed for his death-bed, for an end that had lost its
                bitterness. Meanwhile by Fate's decree the storm rose to its height, and took by
                violence all that was left of the ship. No mast, no helm, no rope or oar remained on
                her. She drifted on the waves like a rough and unshapen lump of wood. . . .</p>
            <p>Some fishermen in handy little boats put out to seize their prey. When they saw some
                men alive and ready to fight for their belongings, they altered their savage plans
                and came to the rescue. . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="115"/>We heard a strange noise, and a groaning like a
                wild beast, coming from under the master's cabin. So we followed the noise, and
                found Eumolpus sitting there inscribing verses on a great parchment. We were
                surprised at his having time to write poetry with death close at hand, and we pulled
                him out, though he protested, and implored him to be sensible. But he was furious at
                our interruption, and cried: <quote>Let me complete my design; the poem halts at the

                bellowing bard ashore. . .</p>
            <p>When this business was at last completed, we came sadly to a fisherman's cottage,
                refreshed our<pb id="p.243"/> selves more or less with food spoilt by sea-water, and

                part of the country we should venture, I suddenly saw a man's body caught in a
                gentle eddy and carried ashore. I stopped gloomily, and, with moist eyes, began to
                reflect upon the treachery of the sea. <quote>Maybe,</quote> I cried, <quote>there
                    is a wife waiting cheerfully at home for this man in a far-offland, or a son or
                    a father, maybe, who know nothing of this storm; he is sure to have left some
                    one behind whom he kissed before he went. So much for mortal men's plans, and
                    the prayers of high ambition. Look how the man floats.</quote> I was still
                crying over him as a perfect stranger, when a wave turned his face towards the shore
                without a mark upon it, and I recognized Lichas, but a while ago so fierce and so
                relentless, now thrown almost under my feet. Then I could restrain my tears no
                longer; I beat my breast again and again, and cried, <quote>Where is your temper and
                    your hot head now? Behold! you are a prey for fish and savage beasts. An hour
                    ago you boasted the strength of your command, and you have not one plank of your
                    great ship to save you. Now let mortal men fill their hearts with proud
                    imaginations if they will. Let misers lay out the gains they win by fraud for a
                    thousand years. Lo! this man but yesterday looked into the accounts of his
                    family property, and even settled in his own mind the very day when he would
                    come home again. Lord, Lord, how far he lies from his consummation! But it is
                    not the waves of the sea alone that thus keep faith with mortal men. The
                    warrior's weapons fail him; another pays his vows to Heaven, and his own house
                    falls and buries him in the act. Another slips from his coach and dashes out his
                    eager soul: the glutton<pb id="p.245"/> chokes at dinner, the sparing man dies
                    of wait. Make a fair reckoning, and you find shipwreck everywhere. You tell me
                    that for those the waters whelm there is no burial. As if it mattered how our
                    perishable flesh comes to its end, by fire or water or the lapse of time!
                    Whatever you may do, all these things achieve the same goal. But beasts will
                    tear the body, you say, as though fire would give it a more kindly welcome! When
                    we are angry with our slaves, we consider burning their heaviest punishment.

                    of us behind!</quote>. . .</p>
            <p>So Lichas was burned on a pyre built by his enemy's hands. Eumolpus proceeded to
                compose an epitaph on the dead man, and looked about in search of some far-fetched
                ideas. . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="116"/>We gladly performed this last office, and then
                took up our proposed way, and in a short while came sweating to a mountain top, from
                which we saw, not far off, a town set on a high peak. We had lost ourselves, and did
                not know what it was, until we learned from a farm-bailiff that it was Croton, a
                town of great age, and once the first city in Italy. When we went on to inquire
                particularly what men lived on such honoured soil, and what kind of business pleased
                them best, now that their wealth had been brought low by so many wars, the man
                replied, <quote>My friends, if you are business men, change your plans and look for
                    some other safe way of life. But if you profess to be men of a superior stamp
                    and thorough-paced liars, you are on the direct road to wealth. In this city the
                    pursuit of learning is not esteemed, eloquence has no place, economy and a pure
                    life do not win their reward in honour: know that the whole of<pb id="p.247"/>
                    the men you see in this city are divided into two classes. They are either the
                    prey of legacy-hunting or legacy-hunters themselves. In this city no one brings
                    up children, because anyone who has heirs of his own stock is never invited to
                    dinner or the theatre; he is deprived of all advantages, and lies in obscurity
                    among the base-born. But those who have never married, and have no near
                    relations, reach the highest positions; they alone, that is, are considered
                    soldierly, gallant, or even good. <quote>Yes,</quote> he went on, you will go
                    into a town that is like a plague-stricken plain, where there is nothing but
                    carcasses to be devoured, and crows to devour them.</quote> . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="117"/>Eumolpus was more cautious, and directed his
                attention to the novelty of the case, declaring that this kind of prophecy did not
                make him uneasy. I thought the old man was joking with the light heart of a poet,
                but then he said, I only wish I had a more ample background, I mean a more
                gentlemanly dress, and finer ornaments, to lend colour to my strange tale; I declare
                I would not put off the business, I would bring you into great wealth in a moment.
                Anyhow, I promise to do whatever my fellow-robber demands, so long as my clothes are
                satisfactory, and whatever we may find in Lycurgus's house when we break in. I am
                sure that our mother goddess for her honour's sake will pay up some coin to us for
                present needs.". . .<quote>Well then,</quote> said Eumolpus, <quote>Why shouldn't we
                    make up a farce? Now appoint me your master, if you like the business.</quote>
                No one dared to grumble at this harmless device. So to keep the lie safe among us
                all, we took an oath to obey Eumolpus; to endure burning, bondage, flogging, death
                by the sword, or anything else that Eumolpus ordered. We<pb id="p.249"/> pledged our
                bodies and souls to our master most solemnly, like regular gladiators. When the oath
                was over, we posed like slaves and saluted our master, and learned all together that
                Eumolpus had lost a son, a young man of great eloquence and promise, and that the
                poor old man had left his own country for this reason, to escape seeing his son's
                dependants and friends, or the tomb which was the source of his daily tears. His
                grief had been increased by a recent shipwreck, in which he lost over two million
                sesterces: it was not the loss that troubled him, but with no servant to wait upon
                him he could not recognize his own importance. Besides, he had thirty millions
                invested in Africa in estates and bonds; such a horde of his slaves was scattered
                over the fields of Numidia that he could positively have sacked Carthage. Under this
                scheme we ordered Eumolpus to cough frequently, sometimes to be bilious, and to find
                fault openly with all his food; he must talk of gold and silver and his
                disappointing farms and the obstinate barrenness of the soil; further, he must sit
                over his accounts daily, and revise the sheets of his will every month. To make the
                setting quite complete, he was to use the wrong names whenever he tried to call one
                of us, so that it would clearly look as though our master had also in his mind some
                servants who were not present. This was all arranged; we offered a prayer to Heaven
                for a prosperous and happy issue, and started on our journey. But Giton was not used
                to a burden and could not bear it, and the slave Corax, a shirker of work, kept
                putting down his bundle and cursing our hurry, and declaring that he would either
                throw the baggage away or run off with his load. <quote>You seem to think I am a
                    beast of burden or<pb id="p.251"/> a ship for carrying stones,</quote> he cried.
                    <quote>You paid for the services of a man, not a horse. I am just as free as you
                    are, although my father did leave me a poor man.</quote> Not satisfied with
                curses, he kept lifting his leg up and filling the whole road with a disgusting
                noise and smell. Giton laughed at his impudence and matched every noise he made. . .

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="118"/><quote>Yes, my young friends,</quote> said
                Eumolpus, "poetry has led many astray. As soon as a man has shaped his verse in feet
                and woven into it a more delicate meaning with an ingenious circumlocution, he
                thinks that forthwith he has scaled Helicon. In this fashion people who are tired
                out with forensic oratory often take refuge in the calm of poetry as in some happier
                haven, supposing that a poem is easier to construct than a declamation adorned with
                quivering epigrams. But nobler souls do not love such coxcombry, and the mind cannot
                conceive or bring forth its fruit unless it is steeped in the vast flood of
                literature. One must flee away from all diction that is, so to speak, cheap, and
                choose words divorced from popular use, putting into practice, <quote>I hate the
                    common herd and hold it afar.</quote><note>Horace, <hi rend="italics">Odes</hi>
                    iii, 1.</note> Besides, one must take care that the epigrams do not stand out
                from the body of the speech: they must shine with a brilliancy that is woven into
                the material. Homer proves this, and the lyric poets, and Roman Virgil, and the
                studied felicity of Horace. The others either did not see the path that leads to
                poetry, or saw it and were afraid to walk in it For instance, anyone who attempts
                the vast theme of the Civil War<note>The theme of the Pharsalia of Lucan, against
                    whom Eumolpus's criticisms seem to be directed.</note> will sink under the
                    burden<pb id="p.253"/> unless he is full of literature. It is not a question of
                recording -real events in verse; historians can do that far better. The free spirit
                of genius must plunge headlong into allusions and divine interpositions, and rack
                itself for epigrams coloured by mythology, so that what results seems rather the
                prophecies of an inspired seer than the exactitude of a statement made on oath
                before witnesses: the following effusion will show what I mean, if it take your
                fancy, though it has not yet received my final touches. . . .</p>

                sea and land and the course of sun and moon. But he was not satisfied. Now the
                waters were stirred and troubled by his loaded ships; if there were any hidden bay
                beyond, or any land that promised a yield of yellow gold, that place was Rome's
                enemy, fate stood ready for the sorrows of war, and the quest for wealth went on.
                There was no happiness in familiar joys, or in pleasures dulled by the common man's
                use. The soldier out at sea would praise the bronze of Corinth; bright colours dug
                from earth rivalled the purple; here the African curses Rome, here the Chinaman

                man's finest age may be hedged round with delay and hold back the hurrying years,
                Nature seeks for herself, and finds herself not. So all take their pleasure in
                harlotry, and the halting steps of a feeble body, and in flowing hair and numberless
                clothes of new names, everything that ensnares mankind.</p>

                her deep disgrace was herself both price and prize, and despoiled herself without an
                avenger. Moreover filthy usury and the handling of money had caught the common
                people in a double whirlpool, and destroyed them. Not a house is safe, not a man but
                is mortgaged; the madness spreads through their limbs, and trouble bays and hounds
                them down like some disease sown in the dumb flesh. In despair they turn to
                violence, and bloodshed restores the good things lost by luxury. A beggar can risk
                everything in safety. Could the spell of healthful reason stir Rome from the filth

                that even then he gazed on civil strife. In another quarter Cynthia darkened her
                full face, and denied her light to the crime. The mountain-tops slid down and the
                peaks broke in thunder, the wandering streams were dying, and no more ranged abroad
                between their familiar banks. The sky is loud with the clash of arms, the trumpet
                shakes to the stars and rouses the War God, and at once Aetna is the prey of
                unaccustomed fires, and casts her lightnings high into the air. The faces of the
                dead are seen visible among the tombs and the unburied bones, gibbering in dreadful
                menace. A blazing light girt with unknown stars leads the way for the flames of
                cities, and the sky rains down fresh showers of blood. In a little while God made
                these portents plain. For now Caesar shook off all his lingering, and, spurred by
                the passion of revenge, threw down his arms against Gaul and took them up against
                Rome.</p>
            <p>"In the high Alps, where the rocks trodden by a Greek god<note>Hercules was said to
                    have been the first to cross the Alps.</note> slope downward and allow men to
                    ap<pb id="p.265"/> proach them, there is a place sacred to the altars of
                Hercules: the winter seals it with frozen snow, and heaves it up on its white top to
                the sky. It seems as though the sky had fallen away from there: the beams of the
                full sun do not soften the place, nor the breezes of the springtime, but the soil
                stands stiff with ice and winter's frost: its frowning shoulders could support the
                whole globe. When Caesar with his exultant army trod these heights and chose a
                place, he looked far over the fields of Hesperia from the high mountaintop, and
                lifted his voice and both hands to the stars and said: 'Jupiter, Lord of all, and
                thou land of Saturn, once proud of my victories and loaded with my triumphs, I call
                you to witness that I do not willingly summon the War God to these hosts, and that
                my hand is not raised willingly to strike. But I am driven on by wounds, by
                banishment from my own city, while I dye the Rhine with blood and cut off the Gauls
                from the Alps on their second march to our Capitol.<note>The traditional date for
                    the sack of Rome by the Gauls is 390 B.C.</note> Victory makes my exile doubly
                sure. My rout of the Germans and my sixty triumphs were the beginning of my
                offences. Yet who is it that fears my fame, who are the men that watch me fight?
                Base hirelings bought at a price, to whom my native Rome is a stepmother. But I
                think that no coward shall bind my strong arm unhurt without a blow in return. Come,
                men, to victory while anger is hot, come, my comrades, and plead our cause with the
                sword. For we are all summoned under one charge, and the same doom hangs over us
                all. My thanks are your due, my victory is not mine alone. Wherefore, since
                punishment threatens our trophies, and disgrace is the meed<pb id="p.267"/> of
                conquest, let Chance decide how our lot shall fall. Raise the standard and prove
                your strength. My pleading at least is accomplished; armed amid so many warriors I
                cannot know defeat.' As he spoke these words aloud, the Delphic bird<note>The raven,
                    consecrated to Apollo on account of its gift of prophecy.</note> in the sky gave
                a happy omen, and beat the air as it flew. And from the left quarter of a gloomy
                grove strange voices sounded and fire flashed thereafter. Even Phoebus glowed with
                orb brighter than his wont, and set a burning halo of gold about his face.</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="123"/>"Heartened by these omens, Caesar advanced the
                standards of war, and marched first to open this strange tale of daring. At first
                indeed the ice and the ground fettered with white frost did not fight against them,
                and lay quiet in the kindly cold. But then the regiments broke the close-bound
                clouds, the trembling horses shattered the frozen bonds of the waters, and the snows
                melted. Soon new-born rivers rolled from the mountain heights, but they, too, stood
                still as if by some command, and the waves stopped short with ruining floods
                enchained, and the water that ran a moment before now halted, hard enough to cut.
                But then, treacherous before, it mocked their steps and failed their footing; horses
                and men and arms together fell heaped in misery and ruin. Lo! too, the clouds were
                shaken by a strong wind, and let fall their burden, and round the army were gusts of
                whirlwind and a sky broken by swollen hail. Now the clouds themselves burst and fell
                on the armed men, and a mass of ice showered upon them like a wave of the sea. Earth
                was overwhelmed in the deep snow, and the stars of heaven, and the rivers that clung
                to their banks. But Caesar was not yet overwhelmed; he<pb id="p.269"/> leaned on his
                tall spear and crushed the rough ground with fearless tread, like the son of
                    Amphitryon<note>Hercules: he came down to rescue Prometheus.</note> hastening
                down from a high peak of Caucasus, or the fierce countenance of Jupiter, when he
                descended from the heights of great Olympus and scattered the arms of the doomed
                Giants.</p>
            <p>"While Caesar treads down the swelling peaks in his wrath, Rumour flies swift in
                terror with beating wings, and seeks out the lofty top of the tall Palatine. Then
                she strikes all the images of the gods with her message of Roman thunder: how ships
                are now sweeping the sea, and the horsemen red with German blood pouring hotly over
                the range of the Alps. Battle, blood, slaughter, fire, and the whole picture of war
                flits before their eyes. Their hearts shake in confusion, and are fearfully divided
                between two counsels. One man chooses flight by land, another trusts rather to the
                water, and the open sea now safer than his own country. Some prefer to attempt a
                fight and turn Fate's decree to account. As deep as a man's fear is, so far he
                flies. In the turmoil the people themselves, a woeful sight, are led swiftly out of
                the deserted city, whither their stricken heart drives them. Rome is glad to flee,
                her true sons are cowed by war, and at a rumour's breath leave their houses to
                mourn. One holds his children with a shaking hand, one hides his household gods in
                his bosom, and weeping, leaves his door and calls down death on the unseen enemy.
                Some clasp their wives to them in tears, youths carry their aged sires, and, unused
                to burdens, take with them only what they dread to lose. The fool drags all his
                goods after him, and marches laden with booty to the battle: and<pb id="p.271"/> all
                now is as when on high the rush of a strong south wind tumbles and drives the
                waters, and neither rigging nor helm avail the crews, and one girds together the
                heavy planks of pine, another heads for quiet inlets and a waveless shore: a third
                sets sail and flees, and trusts all to Chance. But why sorrow for these petty ills?

                were mailed with a scurf of rust, her tongue was dripping with foulness and her face
                beset with snakes, her clothes were torn before her writhen breasts, and she waved a
                red torch in her quivering hand. When she had left behind the darkness of Cocytus

                Apennine, to gaze down thence upon all the earth and all its shores, and the armies

                fortune-hunters, who inquired what kind of men we were, and where we had come from.
                Then, as arranged by our common council,<pb id="p.277"/> a torrent of ready words
                burst from us, and they gave easy credence to our account of ourselves and our

                Eumolpus was flushed with success, and so far forgot the former state of his

                pleasure, and that his own dependants would escape unpunished by the kindness of his
                friends if they committed any crime in that city. But though I had lined my belly
                well every day with the ever-growing supply of good things, and believed that
                Fortune had turned away her face from keeping a watch on me, still I often thought
                over my old life and my history, and kept saying to myself, Supposing some cunning
                legacy-hunter sends a spy over to Africa and finds out our lies? Or supposing the
                servant grows weary of his present luck and gives his friends a hint, or betrays us
                out of spite, and exposes the whole plot? Of course we shall have to run away again;
                we must start afresh as beggars, and call back the poverty we have now at last

                eyes were brighter than stars far from the moon, and her nose had a little curve,

            <p><quote>What,</quote> she said, <quote>you give me the one without whom you cannot

                Even as she spoke grace made her words so attractive, the sweet noise fell so softly
                upon the listening air, that you seemed to have the harmony of the Sirens ringing in
                the breeze. So as I marvelled, and all the light of the sky somehow fell brighter
                upon me, I was moved to ask my goddess her name. <quote>Then my maid did not tell
                    you that I am called Circe?</quote> she said. <quote>I am not the Sun-child
                    indeed, and my mother has never stayed the moving world in its course while she

                    together. Surely now, the Gods with their quiet thoughts have some plan in the

            <p>Circe was silent, folded me in two arms softer than a bird's wing, and drew me to the
                ground on a carpet of coloured flowers.</p>

                <quote>Such flowers as Earth, our mother, spread on Ida's top when Jupiter embraced
                    her and she yielded her love, and all his heart was kindled with fire: roses
                    glowed there, and violets, and the tender flowering rush; and white lilies
                    laughed from the green grass: such a soil summoned Venus to the soft grasses,
                    and the day grew brighter and looked kindly on their hidden pleasure.</quote>

                the cloak the earth had stained, and hurried into the temple of Venus. But I was
                lost and horror-stricken as if I had seen a ghost, and began to inquire of my heart

            <p>As when dreams deceive our wandering eyes in the heavy slumber of night, and under

                spoil and snatch at the treasure, sweat too runs down our face, and a deep fear
                grips our heart that maybe some one will shake out our laden bosom, where he knows
                the gold is hid: soon, when these pleasures flee from the brain they mocked, and the

            <p>Chrysis came into my room and gave me a letter from her mistress, who wrote as
                follows: <quote>Circe greets Polyaenus. If I were a passionate woman, I should feel
                    betrayed and hurt: as it is I can be thankful even for your coldness. I have
                    amused myself too long with the shadow of pleasure. But I should like to know
                    how you are, and whether your feet carried you safely home; the doctors say that
                    people who have lost their sinews cannot walk. I tell you what, young man, you
                    must beware of paralysis. I have never seen a sick person in such grave danger;
                    I declare you are as good as dead. If the same mortal chill attacks your knees
                    and hands, you may send for<pb id="p.289"/> the funeral trumpeters. And what
                    about me? Well even if I have been deeply wounded, I do not grudge a poor man a
                    cure. If you want to get well, ask Giton. I think you will recover your sinews
                    if you sleep for three days without your brother. So far as I am concerned, I am
                    not afraid of finding anyone who dislikes me more. My looking-glass and my
                    reputation do not lie. Keep as well as you can.</quote></p>
            <p>When Chrysis saw that I had read through the whole of this complaint, she said:
                    <quote>These things often happen, especially in this town, where the women can
                    even draw down the moon from the sky, and so attention will be paid to this
                    matter also. Only do write back more gently to my mistress, and restore her
                    spirits by your frank kindness. For I must tell you the truth: she has never
                    been herself from the moment you insulted her.</quote></p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="130"/>I obeyed the girl with pleasure and wrote on a
                tablet as follows: <quote>Polyaenus greets Circe. Dear lady, I admit my many
                    failings; for I am human, and still young. But never before this day have I
                    committed deadly sin. The culprit confesses to you; I have deserved whatever you
                    may order. I have been a traitor, I have destroyed a man, and profaned a temple:
                    demand my punishment for these crimes. If you decide on execution, I will come
                    with my sword; if you let me off with a flogging, I will run naked to my lady.
                    Illud unum memento, non me sed instrumenta peccasse. Paratus miles arma non
                    habui. Who upset me so I know not. Perhaps my will ran on while my body lagged
                    behind, perhaps I wasted all my pleasure in delay by desiring too much. I cannot
                    discover what I did. But you tell me to beware of paralysis: as if the disease
                    could grow<pb id="p.291"/> worse, which has taken away from me the means of
                    making you my own. But my apology amounts to this&mdash;I will do your
                    pleasure if you allow me to mend my fault.</quote> . . .</p>
            <p>Chrysis was sent off with this promise, and I paid great attention to my offending
                body, and after leaving my bath anointed myself in moderation, and then fed on
                strong foods, onions, I mean, and snails' heads without sauce, and drank sparingly
                of wine. I then settled myself with a gentle walk before bed, and went into my room
                without Giton. I was so anxious to please her that I was afraid my brother might
                take away my strength.<milestone unit="section" n="131"/> Next day I got up sound in
                mind and body, and went down to the same grove of planetrees, though I was rather
                afraid of the unlucky place, and began to wait among the trees for Chrysis to lead
                me on my way.</p>
            <p>After walking up and down a short while, I sat where I had been the day before, and
                Chrysis came under the trees, bringing an old woman with her. When she had greeted
                me, she said, <quote>Well, disdainful lover, have you begun to come to your
                senses?</quote> Then the old woman took a twist of threads of different colours out
                of her dress, and tied it round my neck. Then she mixed some dust with spittle, and
                took it on her middle finger, and made a mark on my forehead despite my protest . .
                . .</p>
            <p>After this she ordered me in a rhyme to spit three times and throw stones into my
                bosom three times, after she had said a spell over them and wrapped them in purple,
                and laid her hands on me and began to try the force of her charm. . . . Dicto citius

            <p>The stately plane-tree, and Daphne decked with berries, and the quivering cypresses,
                and the swaying tops of the shorn pines, cast asummer shade. Among them played the
                straying waters of a foamy river, lashing the pebbles with its chattering flow. The
                place was proper to love; so the nightingale of the woods bore witness, and Procne
                from the town, as they hovered about the grasses and the tender violets, and pursued
                their stolen loves with a song. . . .</p>
            <p>She was stretched out there with her marble neck pressed on a golden bed, brushing
                her placid face with a spray of myrtle in flower. So when she saw me she blushed a
                little, of course remembering my rudeness the day before; then, when they had all
                left us, she asked me to sit by her, and I did; she laid the sprig of myrtle over my
                eyes, and then growing bolder, as if she had put a wall between us, <quote>Well,
                    poor paralytic,</quote> she said, <quote>have you come here to-day a whole man?</quote>
                <quote>Do not ask me,</quote> I replied, <quote>try me.</quote> I threw myself
                eagerly into her arms, and enjoyed her kisses unchecked by any magic until I was
                tired . . . . .</p>
            <p><milestone unit="section" n="132"/>The loveliness of her body called to me and drew
                us together. There was the sound of a rain of kisses as our lips met, our hands were
                clasped and discovered all the ways of love, then our bodies were held and bound by
                our embrace until even our souls were made as one soul. . . .</p>
            <p>My open taunts stung the lady, and at last she ran to avenge herself, and called her
                chamber grooms, and ordered me to be hoisted for flogging. Not content With this
                black insult, the woman called up all her low<pb id="p.295"/> spinsters, and the
                very dregs of her slaves, and invited them to spit upon me. I put my hands to my
                eyes and never poured forth any appeal, for I knew my deserts, and was beaten and
                spat upon and thrown out of doors. Proselenos was thrown out too, Chrysis was
                flogged, and all the slaves muttered gloomily to themselves, and asked who had upset
                their mistress's spirits. . . . So after considering my position I took courage, and
                carefully hid the marks of the lash for fear Eumolpus should exult or Giton be
                depressed at my disgrace. | Quod solum igitur salvo pudore poteram, contingere

                bed, and took a cane off the door and beat me again when I remained unresponsive.
                And if the cane had not broken at the first stroke and lessened the force of the
                blow, I daresay she would have broken my head and my arm outright. Anyhow I groaned
                at her dirty tricks, and wept abundantly, and covered my head with my right arm, and
                leaned against the pillow. She was upset, and cried too, and sat on another piece of
                the bed, and began to curse the delays of old age in a quavering voice, when the
                priestess came in.</p>

                    Just to show you, what do you think of a man who can come away from Circe
                    without a spark of pleasure?</quote> When Oenothea heard this she sat down
                between us, shook her head for some time, and then said, "I am the only woman alive

                <quote>Whatever thou seest in the world is obedient to me. The flowery earth, when I
                    will, faints and withers as its juices dry, and, when I will, pours forth its
                    riches, while rocks and rough crags spurt waters wide as the Nile. The great sea
                    lays its waves lifeless before me, and the winds lower their blasts in silence
                    at my feet. The rivers obey me, and Hyrcanian tigers, and serpents, whom I bid
                    stand still. But I will not tell you of small things; the shape of the moon is
                    drawn down to me by my spells, and Phoebus trembles and must turn his fiery
                    steeds as I compel him back in his course. So great is the power of words. The
                    flaming spirit of bulls is quenched and calmed by a maiden's rites, and Circe,
                    the child of Phoebus, transfigured Ulysses's crew with magic songs, and Proteus
                    can take what form he will. And I, who am cunning in these arts, can plant the
                    bushes of Mount Ida in the sea, or set rivers back on lofty peaks.</quote>

            <p><milestone unit="section" n="135"/>I shrank in horror from her promised miracles, and
                began to look at the old woman more carefully. . . .<quote>Now,</quote> cried
                Oenothea, <quote>obey my orders!</quote> and she wiped her hands carefully, leaned
                over the bed, and kissed me once, twice . . . .</p>
            <p>Oenothea put up an old table in the middle of the altar, and covered it with live
                coals, and repaired a wine-cup that had cracked from age with warm pitch. Then she
                drove in once more on the smoky wall a nail which had come away with the wooden
                winecup when she took it down. Then she put on a square cloak, and laid an enormous
                cooking-poton the hearth, and at the same time took off the meat-hooks with a fork a
                bag which had in it some beans put by for use, and some very mouldy pieces of a
                brain smashed into<pb id="p.305"/> a thousand fragments. After unfastening the bag
                she poured out some of the beans on the table, and told me to shell them carefully.
                I obeyed orders, and my careful fingers parted the kernels from their dirty covering
                of shell. But she reproved me for laziness, snatched them up in a hurry, tore off
                the shells with her teeth in a moment, and spat them on to the ground like the empty
                husks of flies. . .</p>
            <p>I marvelled at the resources of poverty, and the art displayed in each particular.

                holiday was set round with hurdles of willow twigs and fresh cups of clay shaped by
                a quick turn of the lowly wheel. There was a vessel for soft honey, and wicker-work
                plates of pliant bark, and a jar dyed with the blood of Bacchus. And the wall round
                was covered with light chaff and spattered mud; on it hung rows of rude nails and
                slim stalks of green rushes. Besides this, the little cottage roofed with smoky
                beams preserved their goods, the soft service-berries hung entwined in fragrant
                wreaths, and dried savory and bunches of raisins; such a hostess was here as was
                once on Athenian soil, worthy of the worship of Hecale,<note>Hecale was a poor woman
                    who entertained Theseus. The poet Callimachus (a native of Cyrene, founded by

                well,. . . and was replacing the brain, which must have been born on her own
                birthday, on the jack with her fork, the rotten stool which she was using to
                    increase<pb id="p.307"/> her height broke, and the old woman's weight sent her
                down on to the hearth. So the neck of the pot broke and put out the fire, which was
                just getting up. A glowing brand touched her elbow, and her whole face was covered
                with the ashes she scattered. I jumped up in confusion and put the old woman
                straight, not without a laugh. . . . She ran off to her neighbours to see to
                reviving the fire, to prevent anything keeping the ceremony back. . . . So I went to
                the door of the house,. . . when all at once three sacred geese, who I suppose
                generally demanded their daily food from the old woman at mid-day, made a rush at
                me, and stood round me while I trembled, cackling horribly like mad things. One tore
                my clothes, another untied the strings of my sandals and tugged them off; the third,
                the ringleader and chief of the brutes, lost no time in attacking my leg with his
                jagged bill. It was no laughing matter: I wrenched off a leg of the table and began
                to hammer the ferocious creature with this weapon in my hand. One simple blow did
                not content me. I avenged my honour by the death of the goose.</p>
            <p>'Even so I suppose the birds of Stymphalus fled into the sky when the power of
                Hercules compelled them, and the Harpies whose reeking wings made the tantalizing
                food of Phineus run with poison. The air above trembled and shook with unwonted
                lamentation, and the palace of heaven was in an uproar.'. .</p>
            <p>The remaining geese had now picked up the beans, which were spilt and scattered all
                over the floor, and having lost their leader had gone back, I think, to the temple.
                Then I came in, proud of my prize and my victory, threw the dead goose behind the
                bed, and bathed the wound on my leg, which was not<pb id="p.309"/> deep, with
                vinegar. Then, being afraid of a scolding, I made a plan for getting away, put my
                things together, and started to leave the house. I had not yet got outside the room,
                when I saw Oenothea coming with a jar full of live coals. So I drew back and threw
                off my coat, and stood in the entrance as if I were waiting for her return. She made
                up a fire which she raised out of some broken reeds, and after heaping on a quantity
                of wood, began to apologize for her delay, saying that her friend would not let her
                go until the customary three glasses had been emptied. <quote>What did you do while
                    I was away?</quote> she went on, <quote>and where are the beans?</quote>
                Thinking that I had done something which deserved a word of praise, I described the
                whole of my fight in detail, and to put an end to her depression I produced the
                goose as a set-off to her losses. When the old woman saw the bird, she raised such a
                great shriek that you would have thought that the geese had come back into the room
                again. <milestone unit="section" n="137"/>I was astonished and shocked to find so strange a crime at my door, and I
                asked her why she had flared up, and why she should be more sorry for the goose than
                for me. But she beat her hands together and said,
                    <quote>You villain, you dare to speak. Do you not know what a dreadful sin you
                    have committed? You have killed the darling of Priapus, the goose beloved of all
                    married women. And do not suppose that it is not serious; if any magistrate
                    finds out, on the cross you go. My house was spotless until to-day, and you have
                    defiled it with blood, and you have given any enemy of mine who likes the power
                    to turn me out of my priesthood.</quote> . . .</p>
            <p><quote>Not such a noise, please,</quote> I said; <quote>I will give you an ostrich to

            <p>I was amazed, and the woman sat on the bed and wept over the death of the goose,
                until Proselenos came in with materials for the sacrifice, and seeing the dead bird,
                inquired why we were so depressed. When she found out she began to weep loudly, too,
                and to compassionate me as if I had killed my own father instead of a common goose.
                I grew tired and disgusted, and said, <quote>Please let me cleanse my hands by
                    paying; it would be another thing if I had insulted you or done a murder. Look,
                    I will put down two gold pieces. You can buy both gods and geese for
                that.</quote> When Oenothea saw the money, she said,<quote>Forgive me, young man, I
                    am troubled on your account. I am showing my love and not my ill-will. So we
                    will do our best to keep the secret. But pray the gods to pardon what you have
                    done.</quote></p>

            <p>She stood a jar of wine under my hands, and made me stretch all my fingers out, and
                rubbed them with leeks and parsley, and threw filberts into the wine with a prayer.
                She drew her conclusions from them according<pb id="p.313"/> as they rose to the top
                or sank. I noticed that the nuts which were empty and had no kernel, but were filled

                were carried to the bottom. . . .</p>
            <p>She cut the goose open, drew out a very fat liver, and foretold the future to me from
                it. Further, to remove all traces of my crime, she ran the goose right through with

                makes dreams for himself. For when rest lies about the limbs subdued by sleep, and
                the mind plays with no weight upon it, it pursues in the darkness whatever was its
                task by daylight. The man who makes towns tremble in war, and overwhelms unhappy
                cities in flame, sees arms, and routed hosts, and the deaths of kings, and plains
                streaming with outpoured blood. They whose life is to plead cases have statutes and
                the courts before their eyes, and look with terror upon the judgement-seat
                surrounded by a throng. The miser hides his gains and discovers buried treasure.<pb
                    id="p.363"/> The hunter shakes the woods with his pack. The sailor snatches his
                shipwrecked bark from the waves, or grips it in death-agony. The woman writes to her
                lover, the adulteress yields herself: and the dog follows the tracks of the hare as
                he sleeps. The wounds of the unhappy endure into the night-season.</p>
