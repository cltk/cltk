A little below, I have rendered <foreign lang="la">via virtutis,</foreign> "the path of true merit."</note> for, on the contrary, you will find, upon reflection, that there is nothing more noble or excellent, and that to nature is wanting rather human industry than ability or time.</p>
<p>The ruler and director of the life of man is the mind, which, when it pursues glory in the path of true merit, is sufficiently powerful, efficient, and worthy of honor,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Worthy of honor] <quote lang="la">clarus.</quote> <cit><quote>"A person may be called <foreign lang="la">clarus</foreign> either on account of his great actions and merits; or on account of some honor which he has obtained, as the consuls were called <foreign lang="la">clarissimi viri;</foreign> or on account of great expectations which are formed from him. But since the worth of him who is <foreign lang="la">clarus</foreign> is known by all, it appears that the mind is here called <foreign lang="la">clarus</foreign> because its nature is such that pre-eminence is generally attributed to it, and the attention of all directed toward it."</quote><bibl>Dietsch.</bibl></cit></note> and needs no assistance from fortune, who can neither bestow integrity, industry, or other good qualities, nor can take them away.

<p>If man, however, had as much regard for worthy objects, as he has spirit in the pursuit of what is useless,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Useless] <quote lang="la">Aliena.</quote> Unsuitable, not to the purpose, not contributing to the improvement of life.</note> unprofitable, and even perilous, he would not be governed by circumstances more than he would govern them, and would attain to a point of greatness, at which, instead of being mortal,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Instead of being mortal] <quote lang="la">Pro mortalibus.</quote> There are two senses in which these words may be taken: as far as mortals can, and instead of being mortals. Kritz and Dietsch say that the latter is undoubtedly the true sense. Other commentators are either silent or say little to the purpose. As for the translators, they have studied only how to get over the passage delicately. The latter sense is perhaps favored by what is said in c. 2, that "the illustrious achievements of the mind are, like the mind itself, immortal."</note> he would be immortalized by glory.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="2">
<p> As man is composed of mind and body, so, of all our concerns and pursuits, some partake the nature of the body, and some that of the mind. Thus beauty of person, eminent wealth, corporeal strength, and all other things of this kind, speedily pass away; but the illustrious achievements of the mind are, like the mind itself, immortal.</p>
<p>Of the advantages of person and fortune, as there is a beginning, there is also an end; they all rise and fall,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">II. They all rise and fall, etc.] <quote lang="la">Omnia orta occidunt, et aucta senescunt.</quote> This is true of things in general, but is here spoken only of the qualities of the body, as De Brosses clearly perceived.</note> increase and decay. But the mind, incorruptible and eternal, the ruler of the human race, actuates and has power over all things,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Has power over all things] <quote lang="la">Habet cuncta.</quote> <cit><quote>"All things are in its power."</quote><bibl>Dietsch.</bibl></cit> <cit><quote>"<foreign lang="la">Sub ditione tenet.</foreign> So <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, Ov.

So Aristippus said, <foreign lang="la">Habeo Laidem, non habeor &agrave; Laide,</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">e)/xw o)uk e)/xomai.</foreign> Cic, Epist, ad Fam. ix. 26.</note> yet is itself free from control.</p>
<p>The depravity of those, therefore, is the more surprising, who, devoted to corporeal gratifications, spend their lives in luxury and indolence, but suffer the mind, than which nothing is better or greater in man, to languish in neglect and inactivity; especially when there are so many and various mental employments by which the highest renown may be attained.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="3">
<p> Of these occupation us, however, civil and military offices,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">III Civil and military offices] <quote lang="la">Magistratus et imperia.</quote> <cit><quote><foreign lang="la">"Illo vocabulo civilia, hoc militaria munera, significantur."</foreign></quote><bibl>Dietsch.</bibl></cit></note> <pb n="82"/>and all administration of public affairs, seem to me at the present time, by no means to be desired; for neither is honor conferred on merit, nor are those, who have gained power by unlawful means, the more secure or respected for it. To rule our country or subjects<note anchored="yes" place="foot">To rule our country or subjects, etc.] <quote lang="la">Nam vi quidem regere patriam aut parents,</quote> etc. Cortius, Gerlach, Kritz, Dietsch, and M&uuml;ller are unanimous in understanding <foreign lang="la">parentes</foreign> as the participle of the verb <foreign lang="la">parco.</foreign> That this is the sense, says Gerlach, is sufficiently proved by the conjunction <foreign lang="la">aut;</foreign> for if Sallust had meant <foreign lang="la">parents,</foreign> he would have used <foreign lang="la">ut;</foreign> and in this opinion Allen coincides. Doubtless, also, this sense of the word suits extremely well with the rest of the sentence, in which changes in government are mentioned. But Bernouf, with Crispinus, prefers to follow Aldus Manutius, who took the word in the other signification, supposing that Sallust borrowed the sentiment from Plato, who says in his Epistle <foreign lang="la">ad Dionis Propinquos:</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">*pate/ra de\ h)\ mhte/ra o)ux o(/sion h(gou=mai prosbiu/zesqai, mh\ no/sw| parafrosu/nhs e)xome/nous. *bi/an de\ patri/di polite/ias metabolh=s hh\ prosferein, o(/tan a)/neu fugw=n, kai\ sfagh=z a)ndrw=n, mh\ dunato\n h(=| gi/nesqai th\n a)risth\n.</foreign> And he makes a similar observation in his Crito: <foreign lang="greek">*pantaxou)= poihte/on, o(\ a(\n keleu/oi h( po/lis te, kai\ h( patri\s.----*bia/zezqai de\ o)ux o(/sion o)/ute mhte/ra, o)/ute pate/ra polu\ de\ tou/twn e)/ti h)tton th\n patri/da.</foreign> On which sentiments Cicero, ad Fam. i. 9, thus comments: <foreign lang="la">Id enim jubet idem ille Plato, quem ego auctorem vehementer sequor; tantum contender in republica quantum probare tuis civibus possis: vim neque parenti, neque patri&oelig; afferre oportere.</foreign> There is also another passage in Cicero, Cat. i. 3, which seems to favor this sense of the word: <foreign lang="la">Si te parentes timerent atque odissent tui, neque eos ull&acirc; ratione placare posses, ut opinor, ab eorum oculis aliqu&ograve; concederes; nunc te patria, qu&oelig; communis est omnium nostrum parens odit ac metuit,</foreign> etc. Of the first passage cited from Plato, indeed, Sallust's words may seem to be almost a translation. Yet, as the majority of commentators have followed Cortius, I have also followed him. Sallust has the word in this sense in Jug., c. 102: <foreign lang="la">Parentes abunde habemus.</foreign> So Vell. Pat. ii. 108: <foreign lang="la">Principatis constans ex voluntate parentium.</foreign></note> by force, though we may have the ability, and may correct what is wrong, is yet an ungrateful undertaking; especially as all changes in the state lead to<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lead to] <quote lang="la">Portendant.</quote> <cit><quote>"<foreign lang="la">Portendere</foreign> in a pregnant sense, meaning not merely to indicate, but <foreign lang="la">quasi secum ferre,</foreign> to carry along with them."</quote><bibl>Kritzius.</bibl></cit></note> bloodshed, exile, and other evils of discord; while to struggle in ineffectual attempts, and to gain nothing, by wearisome exertions, but public hatred, is the extreme of madness; unless when a base and pernicious spirit, perchance, may prompt a man to sacrifice his honor and liberty to the power of a party.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="4">
<p> Among other employments which are pursued by the intellect, the recording of past events is of pre-eminent utility; but of its merits I may, I think, be silent, since many have spoken of them, and since, if I were to praise my own occupation, I might be considered as presumptuously<note anchored="yes" place="foot">IV. Presumptuously] <quote lang="la">Per insolentiam.</quote> The same as <foreign lang="la">insolenter,</foreign> though some refer it, not to Sallust, but to <foreign lang="la">quis existumet,</foreign> in the sense of strangely, i.e. foolishly or ignorantly.

<p>But, in the present state of manners, who is there, on the <pb n="84"/>contrary, that does not rather emulate his forefathers in riches and extravagance, than in virtue and labor? Even men of humble birth,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Men of humble birth] <quote lang="la">Homines novi.</quote> See Cat., c. 23.</note> who formerly used to surpass the nobility in merit, pursue power and honor rather by intrigue and dishonesty, than by honorable qualifications; as if the pr&aelig;torship, consulate, and all other offices of the kind, were noble and dignified in themselves, and not to be estimated according to the worth of those who fill them.</p>
<p>But, in expressing my concern and regret at the manners of the state, I have proceeded with too great freedom, and at too great length. I now return to my subject.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="5">
<p> I am about to relate the war which the Roman people carried on with Jugurtha, King of the Numidians; first, because it was great, sanguinary, and of varied fortune; and secondly, because then, for the first time, opposition was offered to the power of the nobility; a contest which threw every thing, religious and civil, into confusion,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">V. Threw every thing, religious and civil into confusion] <quote lang="la">Divina et humana cuncta permiscuit.</quote> <cit><quote>"All things, both divine and human, were so changed, that their previous condition was entirely subverted."</quote><bibl>Dietsch.</bibl></cit></note> and was carried to such a height of madness, that nothing but war, and the devastation of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, could put an end to civil dissensions.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Civil dissensions] <quote lang="la">Studiis civilibus.</quote> This is the sense in which most commentators take <foreign lang="la">studia;</foreign> and if this be right, the whole phrase must be understood as I have rendered it. So Cortius; <foreign lang="la">"Ut non prius finirentur [studio civilia] nisi bello et vastitate Itali&aelig;."</foreign> Sallust has <foreign lang="la">studia paratium,</foreign> Jug c. 42; and <placeName key="tgn,2083270">Gerlach</placeName> quotes from Cic. pro <placeName key="tgn,2054957">Marcell</placeName>. c. 10: "<foreign lang="la">Non enim consiliis solis et studiis, sed armis etiam et castris dissidebamus.</foreign>"</note> But before I fairly commence my narrative, I will take a review of a few preceding particulars, in order that the whole subject may be more clearly and distinctly understood.</p>
<p>In the second Punic war, in which <placeName key="tgn,2069580">Hannibal</placeName>, the leader of the Carthaginians, had weakened the power of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> more than any other enemy<note anchored="yes" place="foot">More than any other enemy] <quote lang="la">Maxim&egrave;.</quote></note> since the Roman name became great,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Since the Roman name became great] <quote lang="la">Post magnitudinem nominis Romani.</quote> <cit><quote>"I know not why interpreters should find any difficulty in this passage.

In return for which services, after the Carthaginians <pb n="85"/>were subdued, and after Syphax,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Syphax] <cit><quote>"He was King of the Mas&aelig;syli in <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>; was at first an enemy to the Carthaginians (Liv. xxiv. 48), and afterward their friend (Liv. xxviii. 17). He then changed sides again, and made a treaty with Scipio ; but having at length been offered the hand of Sophonisba, the daughter of Asdrubal, in marriage, he accepted it, and returned into alliance with the Carthaginians. Being subsequently taken prisoner by Masinissa and L&aelig;lius, the lieutenant of Scipio, (Liv. xxx. 2) he was carried into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and died at <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName> (Liv. xxx. 45)."</quote><bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></cit></note> whose power in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was great and extensive, was taken prisoner, the Roman people presented to Masinissa, as a free gift, all the cities and lands that they had captured. Masinissa's friendship for us, accordingly, remained faithful and inviolate; his reign<note anchored="yes" place="foot">His reign] <quote lang="la">Imperii.</quote> Cortius thinks that the grant of the Romans ceased with the life of Masinissa, and that his son Micipsa, reigned only over that part of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName> which originally belonged to his father. But in this opinion succeeding commentators have generally supposed him to be mistaken.</note> and his life ended together. His son, Micipsa, alone succeeded to his kingdom; Mastanabal and Gulussa, his two brothers, having been carried off by disease. Micipsa had two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and had brought up in his house, with the same care as his own children, a son of his brother Mastanabal, named Jugurtha, whom Masinissa, as being the son of a concubine, had left in a private station.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="6">
<p> Jugurtha, as he grew up, being strong in frame, graceful in person, but, above all, vigorous in understanding, did not allow himself to be enervated by pleasure and indolence, but, as is the usage of his country, exercised himself in riding, throwing the javelin, and contending in the race with his equals in age; and, though he excelled them all in reputation, he was yet beloved by all. He also passed much of his time in hunting; he was first, or among the first, to wound the lion and other beasts; he performed very much, but spoke very little of himself.</p>
<p>Micipsa, though he was at first gratified with these circumstances, considering that the merit of Jugurtha would be an honor to his kingdom, yet, when he reflected that the youth was daily increasing in popularity, while he himself was advanced in age, and his children but young, he was extremely disturbed at the state of things, and revolved it frequently in his mind. The very nature of man, ambitious of power, and eager to gratify its desires, gave him reason for apprehension, as well as the opportunity afforded by his own age and that <pb n="86"/>of his children, which was sufficient, from the prospect of such a prize, to lead astray even men of moderate desires. The affection of the Numidians, too, which was strong toward Jugurtha, was another cause for alarm; among whom, if he should cut off such a man, he feared that some insurrection or war might arise.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="7">
<p> Surrounded by such difficulties, and seeing that a man, so popular among his countrymen, was not to be destroyed either by force or by fraud, he resolved, as Jugurtha was of an active disposition, and eager for military reputation, to expose him to dangers in the field, and thus make trial of fortune. During the Numantine war,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">VII. During the Numantine war] <quote lang="la">Bello Numantino.</quote> <placeName key="tgn,7017511">Numantia</placeName>, which stood near the source of the <placeName key="tgn,7010409">Durius</placeName> or Douro in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, was so strong in its situation and fortifications, that it withstood the Romans for fourteen years See Florus, ii. 17, 18; Vell. Pat. ii. 4.</note> therefore, when he was sending supplies of horse and foot to the Romans, he gave him the command of the Numidians, whom he dispatched into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, hoping that he would certainly perish, either by an ostentatious display of his bravery, or by the merciless hand of the enemy. But this project had a very different result from that which he had expected. For when Jugurtha, who was of an active and penetrating intellect, had learned the disposition of Publius Scipio, the Roman general, and the character of the enemy, he quickly rose, by great exertion and vigilance, by modestly submitting to orders, and frequently exposing himself to dangers, to such a degree of reputation, that he was greatly beloved by our men, and extremely dreaded by the Numantines. He was indeed, what is peculiarly difficult, both brave in action, and wise in counsel; qualities, of which the one, from forethought, generally produces fear, and the other, from confidence, rashness. The general, accordingly, managed almost every difficult matter by the aid of Jugurtha, numbered him among his friends, and grew daily more and more attached to him, as a man whose advice and whose efforts were never useless. With such merits were joined generosity of disposition, and readiness of wit, by which he united to himself many of the Romans in intimate friendship.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="8">
<p> There were at that time, in our army, a number of officers, some of low, and some of high birth, to whom wealth was more attractive than virtue or honor; men who were attached to certain parties, and of consequence in their own <pb n="87"/>country; but, among the allies, rather distinguished than respected. These persons inflamed the mind of Jugurtha, of itself sufficiently aspiring, by assuring him, "that if Micipsa should die, he might have the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName> to himself; for that he was possessed of eminent merit, and that any thing might be purchased at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>."</p>
<p>When <placeName key="tgn,7017511">Numantia</placeName>, however, was destroyed, and Scipio had determined to dismiss the auxiliary troops, and to return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he led Jugurtha, after having honored him, in a public assembly, with the noblest presents and applauses, into his own tent; where he privately admonished him "to court the friendship of the Romans rather by attention to them as a body, than by practicing on individuals;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">VIII. Rather by attention to them as a body, than by practicing on individuals] <quote lang="la">Public&egrave; qu&agrave;m privatim.</quote> <cit><quote>"<foreign lang="la">Univers&aelig; potius civitatis, qu&aacute;m privatorum gratiam qu&aelig;rendo.</foreign>"</quote><bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></cit> The words can only be rendered periphrastically.</note> to bribe no one, as what belonged to many could not without danger be bought from a few; and adding that, if he would but trust to his own merits, glory and regal power would spontaneously fall to his lot; but, should he proceed too rashly, he would only, by the influence of his money, hasten his own ruin."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="9">
<p> Having thus spoken, he took leave of him, giving him a letter, which he was to present to Micipsa, and of which the following was the purport: "The merit of your nephew Jugurtha, in the war against <placeName key="tgn,7017511">Numantia</placeName>, has been eminently distinguished; a fact which I am sure will afford you pleasure. He is dear to us for his services, and we shall strive, with our utmost efforts, to make him equally dear to the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. As a friend, I sincerely congratulate you; you have a kinsman worthy of yourself, and of his grandfather Masinissa."</p>
<p>Micipsa, when he found, from the letter of the general, that what he had already heard reported was true, being moved, both by the merit of the youth and by the interest felt for him by Scipio, altered his purpose, and endeavored to win Jugurtha by kindness.

<p>A few years afterward, when, being debilitated by age and disease, he perceived that the end of his life was at hand, he is said, in the presence of his friends and relations, and of Adherbal and Hiempsal his sons, to have spoken with Jugurtha in the following manner:</p></div1>

<p>"But on you, Jugurtha, who are superior in age and wisdom, it is incumbent, more than on your brothers, to be cautions that nothing of a contrary tendency may arise; for, in all disputes, he that is the stronger, even though he receive the injury, appears, because his power is greater, to have inflicted it.

<div1 type="chapter" n="11">
<p> To this address, Jugurtha, though he knew that the king had spoken insincerely,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XI. Had spoken insincerely] <quote lang="la">Ficta locutum.</quote> Jugurtha saw that Micipsa pretended more love for him than he really felt.

<p>When the princes had performed his funeral with due magnificence, they met together to hold a discussion on the general condition of their affairs. Hiempsal, the youngest, who was naturally violent, and who had previously shown contempt for the mean birth of Jugurtha, as being inferior on his mother's side, sat down on the right hand of Adherbal, in order to prevent Jugurtha from being the middle one of the three, which is regarded by the Numidians as the seat of honor.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Which is regarded by the Numidians as the seat of honor] <quote lang="la">Quod apud Numidas honori ducitur.</quote> "I incline," says Sir Henry Steuart, "to consider those manuscripts as the most correct, in which the word <foreign lang="la">et</foreign> is placed immediately before <foreign lang="la">apud, Quod et apud Numidas honori ducitur</foreign>." Sir Henry might have learned, had he consulted the commentators, that "the word <foreign lang="la">et</foreign>is placed immediately before <foreign lang="la">apud</foreign>" in no manuscript; that Lipsius was the first who proposed its insertion; and that Crispinus, the only editor who has received it into his text, is ridiculed by Wasse for his folly. "Lipsius," says Cortius, <foreign lang="la">"c&ugrave;m sciret apud Romanos etiam medium locum honoratiorem fuisse, corrigit: quod et apud Numidas honori ducitur.

Abherbal had then to remove Hiempsal <foreign lang="la">in alteram parten,</foreign> that is, to induce him to take the seat corresponding to his own, on the other side of the middle one.</note></p>
<p>In the course of this conference, after a long debate about the administration of the kingdom, Jugurtha suggested, among other measures, "that all the acts and decrees made in the last five years should be annulled, as Micipsa, during that period, had been enfeebled by age, and scarcely sound in intellect." Hiempsal replied, "that he was exceedingly pleased with the proposal, since Jugurtha himself, within the last three years, had been adopted as joint-heir to the throne." This repartee sunk deeper into the mind of Jugurtha than any one imagined. From that very time, accordingly, being agitated with resentment and jealousy, he began to meditate and concert schemes, and to think of nothing but projects for secretly cutting off Hiempsal. But his plans proving slow in operation, and his angry feelings remaining unabated, he resolved to execute his purpose by any means whatsoever.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="12">
<p> At the first meeting of the princes, of which I have just spoken, it had been resolved, in consequence of their disagreement, that the treasures should be divided among them, and that limits should be set to the jurisdiction of each. Days were accordingly appointed for both these purposes, but the earlier of the two for the division of the money. The princes, in the mean time, retired into separate places of abode in the neighborhood of the treasury. Hiempsal, residing in the town of Thirmida, happened to occupy the house of a man, who, being Jugurtha's chief lictor,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XII. Chief lictor] <quote lang="la">Proxumus lictor.</quote> <cit><quote>"The <foreign lang="la">proximus lictor</foreign> was he who, when the lictors walked before the prince or magistrate in a regular line, one behind the other, was last, or next to the person on whom they attended."</quote><bibl>Cortius.</bibl></cit> He would thus be ready to receive the great man's commands, and be in immediate communication with him. We must suppose either that Sallust merely speaks in conformity with the practice of the Romans, or, what is more probable, that the Roman custom of being preceded by lictors had been adopted in <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>.</note> had always been liked and <pb n="91"/>favored by his master. This man, thus opportunely presented as an instrument, Jugurtha loaded with promises, and induced him to go to his house, as if for the purpose of looking over it, and provide himself with false keys to the gates; for the true ones used to be given to Hiempsal; adding, that he himself, when circumstances should call for his presence, would be at the place with a large body of men. This commission the Numidian speedily executed, and, according to his instructions, admitted Jugurtha's men in the night, who, as soon as they had entered the house, went different ways in quest of the prince; some of his attendants they killed while asleep, and others as they met them; they searched into secret places, broke open those that were shut, and filled the whole premises with uproar and tumult. Hiempsal, after a time, was found concealed in the hut of a maid-servant,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Hut of a maid-servant] <quote lang="la">Tugurio mulieris ancill&oelig;.</quote> Rose renders <foreign lang="la">tugurio</foreign> "a mean apartment," and other translators have given something similar, as if they thought that the servant must have had a room in the house. But she, and other Numidian servants, may have had huts apart from the dwelling-house. <foreign lang="la">Tugurium</foreign> undoubtedly signifies a hut in general.</note> where, in his alarm and ignorance of the locality, he had at first taken refuge. The Numidians, as they had been ordered, brought his head to Jugurtha.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="13">
<p> The report of so atrocious an outrage was soon spread through <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>. Fear seized on Adherbal, and on all who had been subject to Micipsa. The Numidians divided into two parties, the greater number following Adherbal, but the more warlike, Jugurtha; who, accordingly, armed as large a force as he could, brought several cities, partly by force and partly by their own consent, under his power, and prepared to make himself sovereign of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>. Adherbal, though he had sent embassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to inform the senate of his brother's murder and his own circumstances, yet, relying on the number of his troops, prepared for an armed resistance.

A few days afterward, therefore, he dispatched embassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, with a profusion of gold and silver, whom he directed, in the first place, to make abundance of presents to his old friends, and then to procure him new ones; and not to hesitate, in short, to effect whatever could be done by bribery.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="14">
<p> "My father Micipsa, Conscript Fathers, enjoined me, on his death-bed, to look upon the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName> as mine only by deputation;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XIV.

<p>"Since I was thus to be reduced to such an extremity of wretchedness, I could wish that I were able to implore your aid, Conscript Fathers, rather for the sake of my own services than those of my ancestors; I could wish, indeed, above all, that acts of kindness were due to me from the Romans, of which I should not stand in need; and, next to this,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Next to this] <quote lang="la">Secundum ea.</quote> <cit><quote lang="la">"Priscianus, lib. xiii., de pr&aelig;positione agens Secundum, inquit, quando pro <foreign lang="greek">kata\</foreign> et <foreign lang="greek">meta\</foreign> accipitur, loco pr&oelig;positionis est.

Suffer not, then, O Conscript Fathers, a descendent of that family to implore aid from you in vain.

But I am driven from those very territories which the Roman people gave to my <pb n="94"/>ancestors, and from which my father and grandfather, in conjunction with yourselves, expelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. It is what you bestowed that has been wrested from me; in my wrongs you are insulted.</p>
<p>" Unhappy man that I am! Has your kindness, O my father Micipsa, come to this, that he whom you made equal with your children, and a sharer of your kingdom, should become, above all others,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Above all others] <quote lang="la">Potissim&ugrave;m.</quote></note> the destroyers of your race? Shall our family, then, never be at peace? Shall we always be harassed with war, bloodshed, and exile? While the Carthaginians continued in power, we were necessarily exposed to all manner of troubles; for the enemy were on our frontiers; you, our friends, were at a distance; and all our dependence was on our arms. But after that pest was extirpated, we were happy in the enjoyment of tranquillity, as having no enemies but such as you should happen to appoint us. But lo! on a sudden, Jugurtha, stalking forth with intolerable audacity, wickedness, and arrogance, and having put to death my brother, his own cousin, made his territory, in the first place, the prize of his guilt; and next, being unable to ensnare me with similar stratagems, he rendered me, when under your rule I expected any thing rather than violence or war, an exile, as you see, from my country and my home, the prey of poverty and misery, and safer any where than in my own kingdom.</p>
<p>"I was always of opinion, Conscript Fathers, as I had often heard my father observe, that those who cultivated your friendship might indeed have an arduous service to perform, but would be of all people the most secure. What our family could do for you, it has done; it has supported you in all your wars; and it is for you to provide for our safety in time of peace. Our father left two of us, brothers; a third, Jugurtha, he thought would be attached to us by the benefits conferred upon him; but one of us has been murdered, and I, the other, have scarcely escaped the hand of lawlessness.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">One of us has been murdered, and I, the other, have scarcely escaped the hand of lawlessness] <quote lang="la">Alter eorum necatus, alterius ipse ego manus impias vix effugi.</quote> This is the general reading, but it can not be right. Adherbal speaks of himself and his brother as two persons, and of Jugurtha as a third, and says that of those two the one (<foreign lang="la">alter</foreign>) has been killed; he would then naturally proceed to speak of himself as the other; i.e. he would use the word <foreign lang="la">alter</foreign> concerning himself, not apply it to Jugurtha. <placeName key="tgn,1121113">Allen</placeName>, therefore, proposes to read <foreign lang="la">alter necatus, alter manus impias vix effugi.</foreign> This mode of correction strikes out too much; but there is no doubt that the second <foreign lang="la">alter</foreign> should be in the nominative case.</note> What course <pb n="95"/>can I now take? Unhappy that I am, to what place, rather than another, shall I betake myself? All the props of our family are extinct; my father, of necessity, has paid the debt of nature; a kinsman, whom least of all men it became, has wickedly taken the life of my brother; and as for my other relatives, and friends, and connections, various forms of destruction have overtaken them. Seized by Jugurtha, some have been crucified, and some thrown to wild beasts, while a few, whose lives have been spared, are shut up in the darkness of the dungeon, and drag on, amid suffering and sorrow, an existence more grievous than death itself.</p>
<p>"If all that I have lost, or all that, from being friendly, has become hostile to me,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">From being friendly, has become hostile to me] <quote lang="la">Ex necessariis advorsa facta sunt.</quote> <cit><quote><foreign lang="la">"Si omnia mihi incolumia manerent, neque quidquam rerum mearum (s. pr&aelig;sidiorum) amisissem, neque Jugurtha aliique mihi ex necessariis inimici facti essent."</foreign></quote><bibl>Kritzius.</bibl></cit></note> remained unchanged, yet, in case of any sudden calamity, it is of you that I should still have to implore assistance, to whom, from the greatness of your empire, justice and injustice in general should be objects of regard. And at the present time, when I am exiled from my country and my home, when I am left alone, and destitute of all that is suitable to my dignity, to whom can I go, or to whom shall I appeal, but to you? Shall I go to nations and kings, who, from our friendship with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, are all hostile to my family?

<p>"Masinissa, moreover, instructed us, Conscript Fathers, to cultivate no friendship but that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to adopt no new leagues or alliances, as we should find, in your good-will, abundance of efficient support; while, if the fortune of your empire should change, we must sink together with it. But, by your own merits, and the favor of the gods, you are great and powerful; the whole world regards you with favor and yields to your power; and you are the better able, in consequence, to attend to the grievances of your allies. My only fear is, that private friendship for Jugurtha, too little understood, may lead any of you astray; for his partisans, I hear, are doing their utmost in his behalf, soliciting and importuning <pb n="96"/>you individually, to pass no decision against one who is absent, and whose cause is yet untried; and saying that I state what is false, and only pretend to be an exile, when I might, if I pleased, have remained still in my kingdom.

He omits no argument or representation that could move the pity of the Romans; and if his abject prostration of mind appears more suitable to a woman than a man, it is to be remembered that it is purposely introduced by Sallust to exhibit the weakness of his character."</quote></note> through villainy and the slaughter of our family."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="15">
<p> When the prince had concluded his speech, the embassadors of Jugurtha, depending more on their money than their cause, replied, in a few words, " that Hiempsal had been put to death by the Numidians for his cruelty; that Adherbal, commencing war of his own accord, complained, after he was defeated, of being unable to do injury; and that Jugurtha entreated the senate not to consider him a different person from what he had been known to be at <placeName key="tgn,7017511">Numantia</placeName>, nor to set the assertions of his enemy above his own conduct."</p>
<p>Both parties then withdrew from the senate-house, and the senate immediately proceeded to deliberate. The partisans of the embassadors, with a great many others, corrupted by their influence, expressed contempt for the statements of Adherbal, extolled with the highest encomiums the merits of Jugurtha, and exerted themselves as strenuously, with their interest and eloquence, in defense of the guilt and infamy of another, as <pb n="98"/>they would have striven for their own honor. A few, however, on the other hand, to whom right and justice were of more estimation than wealth, gave their opinion that Adherbal should be assisted, and the murder of Hiempsal severely avenged. Of all these the most forward was &AElig;milius Scaurus,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XV. &AElig;milius Scaurus] He was <quote lang="la">princeps senat&ucirc;s</quote> (see c. 25), and seems to be pretty faithfully characterized by Sallust as a man of eminent abilities, but too avaricious to be strictly honest. Cicero, who alludes to him in many passages with commendation (Off., i. 20, 30; Brut., 29; Pro Mur&aelig;n., 7; Pro Fonteio, 7), mentions an anecdote respecting him (De Orat. ii. 70), which shows that he had a general character for covetousness. See Pliny, H. N. xxxvi. 14. Valerius Maximus (iii. 7, 8) tells another anecdote of him, which shows that he must have been held in much esteem, for whatever qualities, by the public. Being accused before the people of having taken a bribe from Mithridates, he made a few remarks on his own general conduct; and added, "Varius of Sucro says that Marcus Scaurus, being bribed with the king's money, has betrayed the interests of the Roman people. Marcus Scaurus denies that he is guilty of what is laid to his charge. Which of the two do you believe?" The people dismissed the accusation; but the words of Scaurus may be regarded as those of a man rather seeking to convey a notion of his innocence, than capable of proving it. The circumstance which Cicero relates is this: Scaurus had incurred some obloquy for having, as it was said, taken possession of the property of a certain rich man, named Phyrgio Pompeius, without being entitled to it by any will; and being engaged as an advocate in some cause, Memmius, who was pleading on the opposite side, seeing a funeral pass by at the time, said, "Scaurus, yonder is a dead man, on his way to the grave; if you can but get possession of his property!" I mention these matters, because it has been thought that Sallust, from some ill-feeling, represents Scaurus as more avaricious than he really was.</note> a man of noble birth and great energy, but factious, and ambitious of power, honor, and wealth; yet an artful concealer of his own vices. He, seeing that the bribery of Jugurtha was notorious and shameless, and fearing that, as in such cases often happens, its scandalous profusion might excite public odium, restrained himself from the indulgence of his ruling passion.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">His ruling passion] <quote lang="la">Consuet&acirc; libidine.</quote> Namely, avarice.</note></p></div1>

<p> Yet that party gained the superiority in the senate, which preferred money and interest to justice. A decree was made, "that ten commissioners should divide the kingdom, which Micipsa had possessed, between Jugurtha and Adherbal." Of this commission the leading person was Lucius Opimius,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XVI. Lucius Opimius] His contention with the party of C.

<p>Jugurtha, though he had already counted Scaurus among his friends at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, yet received him with the most studied ceremony, and, by presents and promises, wrought on him so effectually, that he preferred the prince's interest to his own character, honor, and all other considerations.

<div1 type="chapter" n="20">
<p> When the commissioners, after dividing the kingdom, had left Africa, and Jugurtha saw that, contrary to his apprehensions, he had obtained the object of his crimes; he then being convinced of the truth of what he had heard from his friends at Numantia, "that all things were purchasable at Rome," and being also encouraged by the promises of those whom he had recently loaded with presents, directed his views to the domain of Adherbal. He was himself bold and warlike, while the other, at whose destruction he aimed, was quiet, unfit for arms, of a mild temper, a fit subject for injustice, and a prey to fear rather than an object of it. Jugurtha, accordingly, with a powerful force, made a sudden irruption into his dominions, took several prisoners, with cattle and other booty, set fire to the buildings, and made hostile demonstrations against <pb n="104"/>several places with his cavalry. He then retreated, with all his followers, into his own kingdom, expecting that Adherbal, roused by such provocation, would avenge his wrongs by force, and thus furnish a pretext for war. But Adherbal, thinking himself unable to meet Jugurtha in the field, and relying on the friendship of the Romans more than on the Numidians, merely sent embassadors to Jugurtha to complain of the outrage; and, although they brought back but an insolent reply, yet he resolved to endure any thing rather than have recourse to war, which, when he attempted it before, had ended in his defeat. By such conduct the eagerness of Jugurtha was not at all allayed; for he had now, indeed, in imagination, possessed himself of all Adherbal's dominions. He therefore renewed hostilities, not, as before, with a predatory band, but at the head of a large army which he had collected, and openly aspired to the sovereignty of all Numidia. Wherever he marched, he ravaged the towns and the fields, drove off booty, and raised confidence in his own men and dismay among the enemy.</p></div1>

On this understanding, both parties separated. Of addressing Adherbal the deputies had no opportunity.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="23">
<p> Jugurtha, as soon as he thought that they had quitted Africa, surrounded the walls of Cirta, which, from the nature of its situation, he was unable to take by assault, with a rampart and a trench; he also erected towers, and manned them with soldiers; he made attempts on the place, by force or by stratagem, day and night; he held out bribes, and some times menaces, to the besieged; he roused his men, by exhortations, to efforts of valor, and resorted, with the utmost perseverance, to every possible expedient.</p>
<p>Adherbal, on the other hand, seeing that his affairs were in a desperate condition, that his enemy was determined on his ruin, that there was no hope of succor, and that the siege, from want of provisions, could not long be protracted, selected from among those who had fled with him to Cirta, two of his most resolute supporters, whom he induced, by numerous promises, and an affecting representation of his distress, to make their way in the night, through the enemy's lines, to the nearest point of the coast, and from thence to Rome.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="24">
<p> The Numidians, in a few days executed their commission; and a letter from Adherbal was read in the senate, of which the following was the purport:</p>
<p>"It is not through my own fault, Conscript Fathers, that I so often send requests to you; but the violence of Jugurtha compels me; whom so strong a desire for my destruction has seized, that he pays no regard<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXIV. Pays no regard] <quote lang="la">Neque--in animo habeat.</quote> This letter of Adherbal's, both in matter and tone, is very similar to his speech in c. 14.</note> either to you or to the immortal gods; my blood he covets beyond every thing. Five months, in consequence, have I, the ally and friend of the Roman people, been besieged with an armed force; neither the remembrance of my father Micipsa's benefits, nor your decrees, are of any avail for my relief; and whether I am more closely pressed by the sword, or by famine, I am unable to say.
<pb n="107"/></p>
<p>"From writing further concerning Jugurtha, my present condition deters me; for I have experienced, even before,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">I have experienced, even before] <quote lang="la">Jam antea expertus sum.</quote> He means, in the result of his speech to the senate.</note> that little credit is given to the unfortunate. Yet I can perceive that his views extend further than to myself, and that he does not expect to possess, at the same time, your friendship and my kingdom; which of the two he thinks the more desirable, must be manifest to every one. For, in the first place, he murdered my brother Hiempsal; and, in the next, expelled me from my dominions; which, however, may be regarded as our own wrongs, and as having no reference to you. But now he occupies your kingdom with an army; he keeps me, whom you appointed a king over the Numidians, in a state of blockade; and in what estimation he holds the words of your embassadors, my perils may serve to show. What then is left, except your arms, that can make an impression upon him ?</p>
<p>"I could wish, indeed, that what I now write, as well as the complaints which I lately made before the senate, were false, rather than that my present distresses should confirm the truth of my statements. But since I am born to be an example of Jugurtha's villainy, I do not now beg a release from death or distress, but only from the tyranny of an enemy, and from bodily torture. Respecting the kingdom of Numidia, which is your own property, determine as you please, but if the memory of my grandfather Masinissa is still cherished by you, deliver me, I entreat you, by the majesty of your empire, and by the sacred ties of friendship, from the inhuman hands of Jugurtha."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="25">
<p> When this letter was read, there were some who thought that an army should be dispatched into Africa, and relief afforded to Adherbal, as soon as possible; and that the senate, in the mean time, should give judgment on the conduct of Jugurtha, in not having obeyed the embassadors. But by the partisans of Jugurtha, the same that had before supported his cause, effectual exertions were made to prevent any decree from being passed; and thus the public interest, as is too frequently the case, was defeated by private influence.</p>
<p>An embassy was, however, dispatched into Africa, consisting of men of advanced years, and of noble birth, and who had filled the highest offices of the state; among whom was Marcus Scaurus, already mentioned, a man who had held the consulship, <pb n="108"/>and who was at that time chief of the senate.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXV. Chief of the senate] <quote lang="la">Princeps senat&ucirc;s.</quote> "He whose name was first entered in the censors' books was called <foreign lang="la">Princeps Senat&ucirc;s,</foreign> which title used to be given to the person who of those alive had been censor first (<foreign lang="la">qui primus censor, ex iis qui viverent, fuisset</foreign>), but after the year <date value="544">544</date>, to him whom the censors thought most worthy, Liv., xxvii. 13. This dignity, although it conferred no command or emolument, was esteemed the very highest, and was usually retained for life, Liv., xxxiv. 44; xxxix. 52. It is called <foreign lang="la">Principatus;</foreign> and hence afterward the Emperor was named <foreign lang="la">Princeps,</foreign> which word properly denotes rank, and not power." Adam's Rom. Antiq., p. 3.</note> These embassadors, as their business was an affair of public odium, and as they were urged by the entreaties of the Numidians, embarked in three days; and having soon arrived at Utica, sent a letter from thence to Jugurtha, desiring him " to come to the province as quickly as possible, as they were deputed by the senate to meet him."</p>
<p>Jugurtha, when he found that men of eminence, whose influence at Rome he knew to be powerful, were come to put a stop to his proceedings, was at first perplexed, and distracted between fear and cupidity. He dreaded the displeasure of the senate, if he should disobey the embassadors; while his eager spirit, blinded by the lust of power, hurried him on to complete the injustice which he had begun. At length the evil incitements of ambition prevailed.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">At length the evil incitements of ambition prevailed] <quote lang="la">Vicit tamen in avido ingenio pravum consilium.</quote> "Evil propensities gained the ascendency in his ambitious disposition."</note> He accordingly drew his army round the city of Cirta, and endeavored, with his utmost efforts, to force an entrance; having the strongest hopes, that, by dividing the attention of the enemy's troops, he should be able, by force or artifice, to secure an opportunity of success. When his attempts, however, were unavailing, and he found himself unable, as he had designed, to get Adherbal into his power before he met the embassadors, fearing that, by further delay, he might irritate Scaurus, of whom he stood in great dread, he proceeded with a small body of cavalry into the Province. Yet, though serious menaces were repeated to him in the name of the senate, because he had not desisted from the siege, nevertheless, after spending a long time in conference, the embassadors departed without making any impression upon him.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="26">
<p> When news of this result was brought to Cirta, the Italians,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXVI. The Italians] <quote lang="la">Italici.</quote> See c. 21.</note> by whose exertions the city had been defended, and who trusted that, if a surrender were made, they would be able, <pb n="109"/>from respect to the greatness of the Roman power, to escape without personal injury, advised Adherbal to deliver himself and t:he city to Jugurtha, stipulating only that his life should be spared, and leaving all other matters to the care of the senate. Adherbal, though he thought nothing less trustworthy than the honor of Jugurtha, yet, knowing that those who advised could also compel him if he resisted, surrendered the place according to their desire. Jugurtha immediately proceeded to put Adherbal to death with torture, and massacred all the inhabitants that were of age, whether Numidians or Italians, as each fell in the way of his troops.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="27">
<p> When this outrage was reported at Rome, and became a matter of discussion in the senate, the former partisans of Jugurtha applied themselves, by interrupting the debates and protracting the time, sometimes exerting their interest, and sometimes quarreling with particular members, to palliate the atrocity of the deed. And had not Caius Memmius, one of the tribunes of the people elect, a man of energy, and hostile to the power of the nobility, convinced the people of Rome that an attempt was being made, by the agency of a small faction, to have the crimes of Jugurtha pardoned, it is certain that the public indignation against him would have passed off under the protraction of the debates; so powerful was party interest, and the influence of Jugurtha's money.

An army was then raised to be sent into Africa; and pay, and all other necessaries of war, were decreed for its use.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="28">
<p> When Jugurtha received this news, which was utterly at variance with his expectations, as he had felt convinced that all things were purchasable at Rome, he sent his son, with two of his friends, as deputies to the senate, and directed them, like those whom he had sent on the murder of Hiempsal, to attack every body with bribes. Upon the approach of these deputies to Rome, the senate was consulted by Bestia, whether they would allow them to be admitted within the gates; and the senate decreed, " that, unless they came to surrender Jugurtha's kingdom and himself, they must quit Italy within the ten following days." The consul directed this decree to be communicated to the Numidians, who consequently returned home without effecting their object.</p>
<p>Calpurnius, in the mean time, having raised an army, chose for his officers men of family and intrigue, hoping that whatever faults he might commit, would be screened by their influence; and among these was Scaurus, of whose disposition and character we have already spoken. There were, indeed, in our consul Calpurnius, many excellent qualities, both mental and personal, though avarice interfered with the exercise of them; he was patient of labor, of a penetrating intellect, of great foresight, not inexperienced in war, and extremely vigilant against danger and surprise.</p>
<p>The troops were conducted through Italy to Rhegium, from thence to Sicily, and from Sicily into Africa; and Calpurnius's first step, after collecting provisions, was to invade Numidia with spirit, where he took many prisoners, and several towns, by force of arms.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="29">
<p> But when Jugurtha began, through his emissaries, to tempt him with bribes, and to show the difficulties of the war which he had undertaken to conduct, his mind, corrupted with avarice, was easily altered. His accomplice, however, and manager in all his schemes, was Scaurus; who, though he had at first, when most of his party were corrupted, displayed violent hostility to Jugurtha, yet was afterward seduced, by a vast sum of money, from integrity and honor to injustice and perfidy-Jugurtha, <pb n="111"/>however, at first sought only to purchase a suspension of hostilities, expecting to be able, during the interval, to make some favorable impression, either by bribery or by interest, at Rome; but when he heard that Scaurus was co-operating with Calpurnius, he was elated with great hopes of regaining peace, and resolved upon a conference with them in person respecting the terms of it. In the mean time, for the sake of giving confidence<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXIX. For the sake of giving confidence] <quote lang="la">Fidei caus&acirc;.</quote> <cit><quote>"In order that Jugurtha might have confidence in Bestia, Sextius the qu&aelig;stor was sent as a sort of hostage into one of Jugurtha's towns."</quote><bibl>Cortius.</bibl></cit></note> to Jugurtha, Sextus the qu&aelig;stor was dispatched by the consul to Vaga, one of the prince's towns; the pretext for his journey being the receiving of corn, which Calpurnius had openly demanded from Jugurtha's emissaries, on the ground that a truce was observed through their delay to make a surrender. Jugurtha then, as he had determined, paid a visit to the consul's camp, where, having made a short address to the council, respecting the odium cast upon his conduct, and his desire for a capitulation, he arranged other matters with Bestia and Scaurus in secret; and the next day, as if by an evident majority of voices,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">As if by an evident majority of voices] <quote lang="la">Quasi per saturam exquisitis sententiis.</quote> "The opinions being taken in a confused manner," or, as we say, in the lump.

<div1 type="chapter" n="30">
<p> When rumor had made known the affairs transacted in Africa, and the mode in which they had been brought to <pb n="112"/>pass, the conduct of the consul became a subject of discussion in every place and company at Rome. Among the people there was violent indignation; as to the senators, whether they would ratify so flagitious a proceeding, or annul the act of the consul, was a matter of doubt. The influence of Scaurus, as he was said to be the supporter and accomplice of Bestia, was what chiefly restrained the senate from acting with justice and honor. But Caius Memmius, of whose boldness of spirit, and hatred to the power of the nobility, I have already spoken, excited the people by his harangues, during the perplexity and delay of the senators, to take vengeance on the authors of the treaty; he exhorted them not to abandon the public interest or their own liberty; he set before them the many tyrannical and violent proceedings of the nobles, and omitted no art to inflame the popular passions. But as the eloquence of Memmius, at that period, had great reputation and influence I have thought proper to give in full<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXX.

<p>During the course of these proceedings at Rome, those whom Bestia had left in Numidia in command of the army, following the example of their general, had been guilty of many scandalous transactions. Some, seduced by gold, had restored Jugurtha his elephants; others had sold him his deserters; others had ravaged the lands of those at peace with us; so strong a spirit of rapacity, like the contagion of a pestilence, had pervaded the breasts of all.</p>
<p>Cassius, when the measure proposed by Memmius had been carried, and while all the nobility were in consternation, set out on his mission to Jugurtha, whom, alarmed as he was, and despairing of his fortune, from a sense of guilt, he admonished " that since he had surrendered himself to the Romans, he had better make trial of their mercy than their power." He also pledged his own word, which Jugurtha valued not less than that of the public, for his safety. Such, at that period, was the reputation of Cassius.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="33">
<p> Jugurtha, accordingly, accompanied Cassius to Rome, but without any mark of royalty, and in the garb, as much as possible, of a suppliant;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXXIII.

<p>An assembly of the people being convoked, Memmius although they were violently exasperated against Jugurtha, (some demanding that he should be cast into prison, others that, unless he should name his accomplices in guilt, he should be put to death, according to the usage of their ancestors, as a public enemy), yet, regarding rather their character than their <pb n="118"/>resentment, endeavored to calm their turbulence and mitigate their rage ; and assured them that, as far as depended on him, the public faith should not be broken. At length, when silence was obtained, he brought forward Jugurtha, and addressed them. He detailed the misdeeds of Jugurtha at Rome and in Numidia, and set forth his crimes toward his father and brothers; and admonished the prince, " that the Roman people, though they were well aware by whose support and agency he had acted, yet desired further testimony from himself; that, if he disclosed the truth, there was great hope for him in the honor and clemency of the Romans; but if he concealed it, he would certainly not save his accomplices, but ruin himself and his hopes forever."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="34">
<p> But when Memmius had concluded his speech, and Jugurtha was expected to give his answer, Caius B&aelig;bius, the tribune of the people, whom I have just noticed as having been bribed, enjoined the prince to hold his peace;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXXIV.

<div1 type="chapter" n="35">
<p> There was at this period in Rome a certain Numidian named Massiva, a son of Gulussa and grandson of Masinissa, who, from having been, in the dissensions among the princes, opposed to Jugurtha, had been obliged, after the surrender of Cirta and the murder of Adherbal, to make his escape out of Africa. Spurius Albinus, who was consul with Quintus Minucius Rufus the year after Bestia, prevailed upon this man, as he was of the family of Masinissa, and as odium and terror hung over Jugurtha for his crimes, to petition the senate for the kingdom of Numidia. Albinus,being eager for the conduct of a war, was desirous that affairs should be disturbed,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXXV. Should be disturbed] <quote lang="la">Movere</quote> is the reading of Cortius; <foreign lang="la">moveri</foreign> that of most other editors, in conformity with most of the MSS. and early editions.</note> rather than sink into tranquillity; especially as, in the division of the provinces, Numidia had fallen to himself, and Macedonia to Minucius.</p>
<p>When Massiva proceeded to carry these suggestions into execution, Jugurtha, finding that he had no sufficient support in his friends, as a sense of guilt deterred some, and evil report or timidity others, from coming forward in his behalf, directed Bomilcar, his most attached and faithful adherent, to procure by the aid of money, by which he had already effected so much, assassins to kill Massiva; and to do it secretly if he could; but, if secrecy should be impossible, to cut him off' in any way whatsoever. This commission Bomilcar soon found means to execute; and, by the agency of men versed in such service, ascertained the direction of his journeys, his hours of leaving home, and the times at which he resorted to particular places,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">The times at which he resorted to particular places] <quote lang="la">Loca atque temrora cuncta.</quote> "All his places and times." There can be no doubt that the sense is what I have given in the text.</note> and, when all was ready, placed his assassins in ambush. One of their number sprung upon Massiva, though with too little caution, and killed him; but being himself caught, he made, at the instigation of many, and especially of Albinus the consul, a full confession. Bomilcar was accordingly committed for trial, though rather on the principles of reason and justice than <pb n="120"/>in accordance with the law of nations,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">In accordance with the law of nations, etc.] As the public faith had been pledged to Jugurtha for his security, his retinue was on the same footing as that of embassadors, the persons of whose attendants are considered as inviolable as their own, as long as they commit no offense against the laws of the country in which they are resident. If any such offense is committed by an attendant of an embassador, an application is usually made by the government to the embassador to deliver him up for trial. Bomilcar seems to have been apprehended without any application having been made to Jugurtha; as, in our own country, the Portuguese embassador's brother, who was one of his retinue, was apprehended and executed for a murder, by Oliver Cromwell. See, on this point, Grotius De Jure Bell. et Pac., xviii. 8; Vattel, iv. 9; Burlamaqui on Politic Law, part iv. ch. 15. Jugurtha, says Vattel, should have given up Bomilcar; but such was not Jugurtha's object.</note> as he was in the retinue of one who had come to Rome on a pledge of the public faith for his safety. But Jugurtha, though clearly guilty of the crime, did not cease to struggle against the truth, until he perceived that the infamy of the deed was too strong for his interest or his money. For which reason, although, at the commencement of the proceedings,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">At the commencement of the proceedings] <quote lang="la">In priori actione.</quote> That is, when Bomilcar was apprehended and charged with the murder.</note> he had given fifty of his friends as bail for Bomilcar, yet, thinking more of his kingdom than of the sureties, he sent him off privately into Numidia; for he feared that if such a man should be executed, his other subjects would be deterred from obeying him.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">His other subjects would be deterred from obeying him] <quote lang="la">Reliquos popularis metus invaderet parendi sibi.</quote> "Fear of obeying him should take possession of his other subjects."</note> A few days after, he himself departed, having been ordered by the senate to quit Italy.

Some would render them O venal city, etc., because Livy, Epit. lxiv., has <foreign lang="la">O urbem venalem</foreign>, but this seems to require that the verb should be in the second person; and it is probable that in Livy we should either eject the "O" or read <foreign lang="la">inveneris.</foreign> Florus, iii. 1, gives the words in the same way as Sallust.</note></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="36">
<p> The war being now renewed, Albinus hastened to transport provisions, money, and other things necessary for the army, into Africa, whither he himself soon followed, with the hope that, before the time of the comitia, which was not far distant, he might be able, by an engagement, by capitulation, or by some other method, to bring the contest to a conclusion. <pb n="121"/>Jugurtha, on the other hand, tried every means of protracting the war, continually inventing new causes for delay; at one time he promised to surrender, at another he feigned distrust; he retreated when Albinus attacked him, and then, lest his men should lose courage, attacked in return, and thus amused the consul with alternate procrastinations of war and of peace.</p>
<p>There were some, at that time, who thought that Albinus understood Jugurtha's object, and who believed that so ready a protraction of the war, after so much haste at the commencement, was to be attributed less to tardiness than to treachery. However this might be, Albinus, when time passed on, and the day of the comitia approached, left his brother Aulus in the camp as propr&aelig;tor,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXXVI. As propr&aelig;tor] <quote lang="la">Pro pr&oelig;tore.</quote> With the power of lieutenant-general.</note> and returned to Rome.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="37">
<p> The republic, at this time was grievously distracted by the contentions of the tribunes.

Throughout the year] <quote lang="la">Totius anni.</quote> That is, all that remained of the year.</note> In consequence of this delay, Aulus, who, as I have just said, was left as propr&aelig;tor in the camp, conceiving hopes either of finishing the war, or of extorting money from Jugurtha by the terror of his army, drew out his troops in the month of January, from their winter-quarters into the field, and by forced marches, during severe weather, made his way to the town of Suthul, where Jugurtha's treasures were deposited. And though this place, both from the inclemency of the season, and from its advantageous situation, could neither be taken nor besieged; for around its walls, which were built on the edge of a steep hill,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">On the edge of a steep hill] <quote lang="la">In pr&aelig;rupti montis extremo.</quote> "<foreign lang="la">In extremo</foreign> a scholiast rightly interprets <foreign lang="la">in margine,</foreign> Gerlach.

Doubtless, as Gerlach observes, the city was on the top of the hill, which was broad enough to hold it; but the words <foreign lang="la">in extremo</foreign> signify that the walls were even with the side of the hill.

<p> Jugurtha, seeing the propr&aelig;tor's vanity and ignorance, artfully strengthened his infatuation; he sent him, from time to time, deputies with submissive messages, while he himself, as if desirous to escape, led his army away through woody defiles and cross-roads. At length he succeeded in alluring Aulus, by the prospect of a surrender on conditions, to leave Suthul, and pursue him, as if in full retreat, into the remoter parts of the country. Meanwhile, by means of skillful emissaries, he tampered night and day with our men, and prevailed on some of the officers, both of infantry and cavalry, to desert to him at once, and upon others to quit their posts at a given signal, that their defection might thus be less observed.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXXVIII.

Gerlach thinks them an intruded gloss.</note> Having prepared matters according to his wishes, he suddenly surrounded the camp of Aulus, in the dead of night, with a vast body of Numidians. The Roman soldiers were alarmed with an unusual disturbance; some of them seized their arms, others hid themselves, others encouraged those that were afraid; but consternation prevailed every where ; for the number of the enemy was great, the sky was thick with clouds and darkness, the danger was indiscernible, and it was uncertain whether it were safer to flee or to remain. Of those whom I have just mentioned as being bribed, one cohort of Ligurians, with two troops of Thracian horse, and a few common soldiers, went over to Jugurtha; and the chief centurion<note anchored="yes" place="foot">The chief centurion] <quote lang="la">Centurio primi pili.</quote> There were sixty centurions in a Roman legion; the one here meant was the first, or oldest, centurior of the Triarii, or Pilani.</note> of the third legion allowed the enemy an entrance at the very post which he had been appointed to defend, and at which all the Numidians poured into the camp. Our men fled disgracefully, the greater part having thrown away their arms, and took possession of a neighboring hill. Night, and the spoils of the camp, prevented <pb n="123"/>the enemy from making full use of this victory. On the following day, Jugurtha, coming to a conference with Aulus, told him, " that though he held him hemmed in by famine and the sword, yet that, being mindful of human vicissitudes, he would, if they would make a treaty with him, allow them to depart uninjured; only that they must pass under the yoke, and quit Numidia within ten days." These terms were severe and ignominious; but, as death was the alternative,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">As death was the alternative] <quote lang="la">Quia mortis metu mutabant.</quote> Neither manuscripts nor critics are agreed about this passage.

Kritzius fancifully and strangely interprets, <foreign lang="la">propter mortis metum se mutabant,</foreign> i.e., <foreign lang="la">alia videbantur atque erant,</foreign> or the acceptance of the terms appeared excusable to the soldiers, because they were threatened with death if they did not accept them.

<div1 type="chapter" n="39">
<p> When this affair was made known at Rome, consternation and dismay pervaded the city; some were concerned for the glory of the republic; others, ignorant of war, trembled for their liberty. But all were indignant at Aulus, and especially those who had been distinguished in the field, because, with arms in his hands, he had sought safety in disgrace rather than in resistance. The consul Albinus, apprehending, from the delinquency of his brother, odium and danger to himself, consulted the senate on the treaty which had been made, but, at the same time, raised recruits for the army, sent for auxiliaries to the allies and Latins, and made general preparations for war. The senate, as was just, decreed, "that no treaty could be made without their own consent and that of the people."</p>
<p>The consul, though he was hindered by the influence of the tribunes from taking with him the force which he had raised, set out in a few days for the province of Africa, where the whole army, being withdrawn, according to the agreement, from Numidia, had gone into winter-quarters. When he arrived there, although he longed to pursue Jugurtha, and diminish the <pb n="124"/>odium that had fallen on his brother, yet, when he saw the state of the troops, whom, besides the flight and relaxation of discipline, licentiousness, and debauchery had corrupted, he determined, under all the circumstances of the case,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XXXIX.

<p> At Rome, in the mean time, Caius Mamilius Limetanus, one of the tribunes, proposed that the people should pass a bill for instituting an inquiry into the conduct of those by whose influence Jugurtha had set at naught the decrees of the senate, as well as of those who, whether as embassadors or commanders, had received money from him, or who had restored to him his elephants and deserters, or had made any compacts with the enemy relative to peace or war. To this bill some, who were conscious of guilt, and, others, who apprehended danger from the jealousy of parties, secretly raised obstructions through the agency of friends, and especially of men among the Latins and Italian allies,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XL. The Latins and Italian allies] <quote lang="la">Per homines nominis Latini, et socios Italicos.</quote> <cit><quote>"The right of voting was not extended to all the Latin people till  A.U.C. 664, and the Italian allies did not obtain it till some years afterward."</quote><bibl>Kritzius.</bibl></cit> So that at this period, which was twenty years earlier, their influence could only be employed in an underhand way.

<p> The prevalence of parties among the people, and of factions in the senate, and of all evil practices attendant on them, had its origin at Rome, a few years before, during a period of tranquillity, and amid the abundance of all that mankind regarded as desirable. For, before the destruction of Carthage, the senate and people managed the affairs of the republic with mutual moderation and forbearance; there were no contests among the citizens for honor or ascendency; but the dread of an enemy kept the state in order. When that fear, however, was removed from their minds, licentiousness and pride, evils which prosperity loves to foster, immediately began to prevail; and thus peace, which they had so eagerly desired in adversity, proved, when they had obtained it, more grievous and fatal than adversity itself.

Things were accordingly directed, both at home and in the field, by the will of a small number of men, at whose disposal were the treasury, the provinces, offices, honors, and triumphs; while the people were oppressed with military service and with poverty, and the generals divided the spoils of war with a few of their friends.

<p> Thus when Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, whose forefathers had done much to increase the power of the state in the Punic and other wars, began to vindicate the liberty of the people, and to expose the misconduct of the few, the nobility, conscious of guilt, and seized with alarm, endeavored, sometimes by means of the allies and Latins,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">By means of the allies and Latins] See on, c. 40.</note> and sometimes by means of the equestrian order, whom the hope of coalition with the patricians had detached from the people, to put a stop to the proceedings of the Gracchi; and first they killed Tiberius, and a few years after Caius, who pursued the same measures as his brother, the one when he was tribune, and the other when he was one of a triumvirate for settling colonies; and with them they cut off Marcus Fulvius Flaccus. In the Gracchi, indeed, it must be allowed that, from their ardor for victory, there was not sufficient prudence.

Others, as Cortius, think it a reflection on the too great violence of the Gracchi. The brevity with which Sallust had expressed himself makes it difficult to decide. Kritzius, who thinks that the remark is in praise of the Gracchi, supplies the ellipse thus: <foreign lang="la">"Sane concedi debet Gracchis non satis moderatum animum fuisse; qu&oelig; res ipsis adeo interitum attulit; sed sic quoque egregii viri putandi sunt; nam bono vinci,"</foreign> etc. Langius and Burnouf join <foreign lang="la">bono</foreign> with <foreign lang="la">more,</foreign> but do not differ much in their interpretations of the passage from that given by Dietsch.</note> to injustice than to triumph over it by improper <pb n="127"/>means. The nobility, however, using their victory with wanton extravagance, exterminated numbers of men by the sword or by exile, yet rather increased, for the time to come, the dread with which they were regarded, than their real power. Such proceedings have often ruined powerful states; for of two parties, each strives to suppress the other by any means whatever, and take vengeance with undue severity on the vanquished.</p>
<p>But were I to attempt to treat of the animosities of parties, and of the morals of the state, with minuteness of detail, and suitably to the vastness of the subject, time would fail me sooner than matter. I therefore return to my subject.</p></div1>

<p> After the treaty of Aulus, and the disgraceful flight of our army, Quintus Metellus and Marcus Silanus, the consuls elect, divided the provinces between them; and Numidia fell to Metellus, a man of energy, and, though an opponent of the popular party, yet of a character uniformly irreproachable.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XLIII.

The new general, accordingly, felt more anxiety from the corrupt morals of the men, than confidence or hope from their numbers. He determined, however, though the delay of the comitia had shortened his summer campaign, and though he knew his countrymen to be anxious for the result of his proceedings, not to commence operations, until, by a revival of the old discipline, he had brought the soldiers to bear fatigue. For Albinus, dispirited by the disaster of his brother Aulus and his army, and having resolved not to leave the province during the portion of the summer that he was to command, had kept the soldiers, for the most part, in a stationary camp,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">In a stationary camp] <quote lang="la">Stativis castris.</quote> In contradistinction to that which the soldiers formed at the end of a day's march.</note> except when stench, or want of forage, obiged them to remove.

<div1 type="chapter" n="45">
<p> But I am assured that Metellus, in these difficult circumstances, no less than in his operations against the enemy, proved himself a great and wise man; so just a medium did he observe between an affectation of popularity and an excessive enforcement of discipline. His first measure was to remove incentives to idleness, by a general order that no one should sell bread, or any other dressed provisions, in the camp; that no sutlers should follow the army; and that no common soldier should have a servant, or beast of burden, either in a camp or on a march. He made the strictest regulations, too, with regard to other things.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XLV.

Thus by preventing rather than punishing irregularities, he in a short time rendered his army effective.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="46">
<p> Jugurtha, meantime, having learned from his emissaries how Metellus was proceeding, and having heard, when lie was in Rome, of the integrity of the consul's character, began to despair of his plans, and at length actually endeavored to effect a capitulation. He therefore sent deputies to the consul with proposals of submission, stipulating only for his own life <pb n="130"/>and that of his children, and offering to surrender every thing else to the Romans. But Metellus had already learned by experience, that the Numidians were a faithless race, of unsettled disposition, and fond of change; and he accordingly applied himself to each of the deputies separately, and after gradually sounding them, and finding them proper instruments for his purpose, prevailed on them, by large promises, to deliver Jugurtha into his hands; bringing him alive, if they could, or dead, if to take him alive was impracticable. In public, however, he directed that such an answer should be given to the king as would be agreeable to his wishes.</p>
<p>A few days afterward, he led the army, which was now vigorous and resolute, into Numidia, where, instead of any appearance of war, he found the cottages full of people, and the cattle and laborers in the fields, while the officers of Jugurtha came from the towns and villages<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XLVI. Villages] <quote lang="la">Mapalibus.</quote> See c. xviii. The word is here used for a collection of huts, a village.</note> to meet him, offering to supply him with corn, to convey provisions for him, and to do whatever might be required of them. Metellus, notwithstanding, made no diminution in the caution with which he marched, but kept as much upon the defensive as if an enemy had been at hand; and he dispatched scouts to explore the country, thinking that these signs of submission were but pretense, and that the Numidians were watching an opportunity for treachery. He himself, with some light-armed cohorts, and a select body of slingers and archers, advanced always in the front; while Caius Marius, his lieutenant-general, at the head of the cavalry, had charge of the rear. The auxiliary horse, distributed among the tribunes of the legions and prefects of the cohorts, he placed on the flanks, so that, with the aid of the light troops mixed with them, they might repel the enemy whenever an approach should be made. For such was the subtlety of Jugurtha, and such his knowledge of the country and the art of war, that it was doubtful whether he was more formidable absent or present, offering peace or threatening hostilities.</p></div1>

<div1 type="chapter" n="48">
<p> Jugurtha, on comparing the words of Metellus with his actions, perceived that he was assailed with his own artifices; for though peace was offered him in words, a most vigorous war was in reality pursued against him; one of his <pb n="132"/>strongest cities was wrested from him; his country was explored by the enemy, and the affections of his subjects alienated. Being compelled, therefore, by the necessity of circumstances, he resolved to try the fortune of a battle.

Then, riding round among the several squadrons and battalions, he exhorted and conjured them to call to mind their former prowess and triumphs, and to defend themselves and their country from Roman rapacity; saying that they would have to engage with those whom they had already conquered and sent under the yoke, and that, though their commander was changed, there was no alteration in their spirit.

The probability, however, if Sallust is consistent with himself in his use of the word, lies with Cortius. Gerlach refers to C&aelig;sar, De Bell, Civ., iii. 89: " <foreign lang="la">Celeriter ex terti&acirc; acie singulas cohortes detraxit, atque ex his quartam instituit;</foreign> but this does not illustrate Sallust's use of the word <foreign lang="la">subsidia:</foreign> C&aelig;sar forms a fourth <foreign lang="la">acies;</foreign> Metellus draws up one <foreign lang="la">acies</foreign> "<foreign lang="la">triplicibus subsidia.</foreign>"</note> he distributed the slingers and archers among the infantry, posted all the cavalry on the flanks, and having made a brief address, such as time permitted, to his men, he led them down, with the front changed into a flank,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">With the front changed into a flank] <quote lang="la">Transversis principiis.</quote> He made the whole army wheel to the left, so that what was their front line, or <foreign lang="la">principia</foreign>, as they faced the enemy on the hill, became their flank as they marched from the mountain toward the river.</note> toward the plain.</p></div1>

<p> But when he observed that the Numidians remained quiet, and did not offer to descend from the hill, he became apprehensive that his army, from the season of the year and the scarcity of water, might be overcome with thirst, and therefore sent Rutilius, one of his lieutenant-generals, with the light-armed cohorts and a detachment of cavalry, toward the river, to secure ground for an encampment, expecting that the enemy, by frequent charges and attacks on his flank, would endeavor to impede his march, and, as they despaired of success in arms, would try the effect of fatigue and thirst on his troops. He then continued to advance by degrees, as his circumstances and the ground permitted, in the same order in which he had descended from the range of mountains. He assigned Marius his post behind the front line,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">L. Behind the front line] <quote lang="la">Post principia.</quote> The <foreign lang="la">principia</foreign> are the same as those mentioned in the preceding note, that is, the front line when the army faced that of Jugurtha on the hill, but which presented its flank to the enemy when the army was on its march. So that Marius commanded in the center ("<foreign lang="la">in medio agmine,</foreign>" says Dietsch), while Metellus took the lead with the cavalry of the left wing. See the following note.</note> and took on himself the command of the <pb n="135"/>cavalry on the left wing, which, on the march, had become the van.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Cavalry on the left wing-which, on the march, had become the van] <quote lang="la">Sinistr&oelig; ul&oelig; equitibus--qui in agmine principes facti erant.</quote> When Metellus halted (c. 49, fin.), and drew up his troops fronting the hill on which Jugurtha was posted, he placed all his cavalry in the wings; consequently, when the army wheeled to the left, and marched forward, the cavalry of the left wing became the van.</note></p>
<p>When Jugurtha perceived that the rear of the Roman army had passed his first line, he took possession of that part of the mountain from which Metellus had descended, with a body of about two thousand infantry, that it might not serve the enemy, if they were driven back, as a place of retreat, and afterward as a post of defense; and then, ordering the signal to be given, suddenly commenced his attack. Some of his Numidians made havoc in the rear of the Romans, while others assailed them on the right and left wings; they all advanced and charged furiously, and every where threw the consul's troops into confusion. Even those of our men who made the stoutest resistance, were baffled by the enemy's versatile method of fighting, and wounded from a distance, without having the power of wounding in return, or of coming to close combat; for the Numidian cavalry, as they had been previously instructed by Jugurtha, retreated whenever a troop of Romans attempted to pursue them, but did not keep in a body, or collect themselves into one place, but dispersed as widely as possible. Thus, being superior in numbers, if they could not deter the Romans from pursuing, they surrounded them, when disordered, on the rear or flank, or, if the hill seemed more convenient for retreat than the plain, the Numidian horses, being accustomed to the brushwood, easily made their way among it, while the difficulty of the ascent, and want of acquaintance with the ground, impeded those of the Romans.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="51">
<p> The aspect of the whole struggle<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LI. Of the whole struggle] <quote lang="la">Totius negotii.</quote> That is, on the side of the Romans,</note> was indeed various, perplexing, direful, and lamentable; the men, separated from their comrades, were partly fleeing, partly pursuing; neither standards nor ranks were regarded, but wherever danger pressed, there they made a stand and defended themselves; arms and weapons, horses and men, enemies, and fellow-countrymen, were all mingled in confusion; nothing was done by direction or command, but chance ordered every thing. Though <pb n="136"/>the day, therefore, was now far advanced, the event of the contest was still uncertain. At last, however, when all were faint with exertion and the heat of the day, Metellus, observing that the Numidians were less vigorous in their charges, drew his troops together by degrees, restored order among them, and led four cohorts of the legions against the enemy's infantry, of whom a great number, overcome with fatigue, had seated themselves on the high ground. He at the same time entreated and exhorted his men not to lose courage, nor to suffer a flying enemy to be victorious; adding that they had neither camp nor citadel to which they could flee, but that their only dependence was on their arms. Nor was Jugurtha, in the mean time, inactive; he rode round among his troops, cheered them, renewed the contest, and, at the head of a select body, made every possible effort for victory; supporting his own men, charging such of the enemy as wavered, and repressing with missiles such as he saw remaining unshaken.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="52">
<p> Thus did these two commanders, both eminent men, maintain the contest against each other. In personal ability they were equal, but in circumstances unequal. Metellus had. resolute troops, but a disadvantageous position; Jugurtha had every thing in his favor except men. At last the Romans, seeing that they had no place of refuge, that the enemy allowed no opportunity for a regular engagement, and that the evening was fast approaching, forced their way, according to the orders which were given, up the hill. The Numidians were thus driven from their position, routed, and put to flight; a few of them were slain, but their speed, and the enemy's ignorance of the country,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LII. The enemy's ignorance of the country] <quote lang="la">Regio hostibus ignara.</quote>  <foreign lang="la">Ignara</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">ignota;</foreign> a country unknown to the enemy.</note> saved the greater number of them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bomilcar, who, as I have said before, was appointed by Jugurtha over the elephants and a part of the infantry, having seen Rutilius pass by him, led down his men gradually into the plain, and while Rutilius hastened to the river, to which he had been dispatched, quietly drew them up in such order as circumstances required; not omitting, at the same time, to watch every movement of the enemy. When he learned that Rutilius had taken his position, and seemed free from apprehension of danger, and heard, at the same time, an increasing noise where Jugurtha was engaged, fearing lest the <pb n="137"/>lieutenant-general, taking the alarm, should go to the support of his countrymen in difficulties, he, in order to intercept his march, increased the extent of his lines, which, from distrust of the bravery of his men, he had previously condensed, and advanced in this order toward Rutilius' camp.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="53">
<p> The Romans, on a sudden, observed a vast cloud of dust, which, as the ground, thickly covered with brushes, obstructed their view, they at first supposed to be only sand raised by the wind; but at length, when they saw that it continued uniform, and approached nearer and nearer as the line advanced, they understood the real cause of it, and, hastily seizing their arms, drew up, as their commander directed, before the camp. When the enemy came up, both sides rushed to the encounter with loud shouts. But the Numidians maintained the contest only as long as they trusted for support to their elephants; for, when they saw the animals entangled in the boughs of the trees, and dispersed or surrounded by the enemy, they betook themselves to flight, and most of them, having thrown away their arms, escaped, by favor of the hill, or of the night, which was now coming on, without injury.

The subtlety of the Numidians, indeed, allowed them neither rest nor relaxation. But as the two parties drew together, in the obscurity of the night, each occasioned, by a noise like that of enemies approaching, alarm and trepidation in the other; and, had not parties of horse, sent forward from both sides, ascertained the truth, a fatal disaster was on the point of happening from the mistake. However, in place of fear, joy quickly succeeded; the soldiers met with mutual congratulations, relating their adventures, or listening to those of others, and each extolling his own achievements to the skies. For thus it is with human affairs; in success, even cowards may boast; while defeat lowers the character even of heroes.

<div1 type="chapter" n="54">
<p> Metellus remained four days in the same camp. He carefully provided for the recovery of the wounded, rewarded, in military fashion, such as had distinguished themselves in the engagements, and praised and thanked them all in a public address; exhorting them to maintain equal resolution in their future labors, which would be less arduous, as they had fought sufficiently for victory, and would now have to contend only for spoil. In the mean time he dispatched deserters, and other eligible persons, to ascertain where Jugurtha was, or what he was doing; whether he had but few followers, or a large army; and how he conducted himself under his defeat. The prince, he found, had retreated to places full of wood, well defended by nature, and was there collecting an army, which would be more numerous indeed than the former, but inactive and inefficient, as being composed of men better acquainted with husbandry and cattle than with war. This had happened from the circumstance, that, in case of flight, none of the Numidian troops, except the royal cavalry, follow their king; the rest disperse, wherever inclination leads them; nor is this thought any disgrace to them as soldiers, such being the custom of the people.</p>
<p>Metellus, therefore, seeing that Jugurtha's spirit was still unsubdued; that a war was being renewed, which could only be conducted<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LIV. Which could only be conducted, etc.] <quote lang="la">Quod, nisi ex illius lubidine, geri non posset.</quote> Cortius omits the <foreign lang="la">non</foreign> before <foreign lang="la">posset,</foreign> but almost every other editor, except Allen, has retained it, from a conviction of necessity.</note> according to the prince's pleasure; and that he was struggling with the enemy on unequal terms, as the Numidians suffered a defeat with less loss than his own men gained a victory, he resolved to manage the contest, not by pitched battles or regular warfare, but in another method. He accordingly marched into the richest parts of Numidia, captured and burned many fortresses and towns, which were insufficiently or wholly undefended, put the youth to the sword, and gave up every thing else as plunder to his soldiers. From the terror caused by these proceedings, many persons were given up as hostages to the Romans; corn, and other necessaries, were supplied in abundance; and garrisons were admitted wherever Metellus thought fit.</p>
<p>These measures alarmed Jugurtha much more than the loss of the late battle; for he, whose whole security lay in flight, was compelled to pursue; and he who could not defend his own <pb n="139"/>part of the kingdom, was obliged to make war in that which was occupied by others. Under these circumstances, however,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Under these circumstances, however] <quote lang="la">Ex copi&acirc; tamen.</quote> With <foreign lang="la">copi&acirc;</foreign> we must understand <foreign lang="la">consiliorum</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">rerum,</foreign> as at the end of c. 39.

He ordered the main body of his army to continue stationary; while he himself, with a select troop of cavalry, went in pursuit of Metellus, and coming upon him unperceived, by means of night marches and by-roads, he fell upon such of the Roman as were straggling about, of whom the greater number, being unarmed, were slain, and several others made prisoners; not one of them, indeed, escaped unharmed; and the Numidians, before assistance could arrive from the camp, fled, as they had been ordered, to the nearest hills.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="55">
<p> In the mean time great joy appeared at Rome when the proceedings of Metellus were reported, and when it was known how he was conducting himself and his army conformably to the ancient discipline; how, on adverse ground, he had gained a victory by his valor; how he was securing possession of the enemy's territory; and how he had driven Jugurtha, when elated by the weakness of Aulus, to depend for safety on the desert or on flight. For these successes, accordingly, the senate decreed a thanksgiving<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LV. A thanksgiving] <quote lang="la">Supplicia.</quote> The same as <foreign lang="la">supplicatio,</foreign> on which the reader may consult Adam's Rom. Ant., or Dr. Smith's Dictionary.</note> to the immortal gods; the city, which had been full of anxiety, and apprehensive as to the event of the war, was now filled with joy; and the fame of Metellus was raised to the utmost height.</p>
<p>The consul's eagerness to gain a complete victory was thus increased; he exerted himself in every possible way, taking care, at the same time, to give the enemy no opportunity of attacking him to advantage. He remembered that envy is the concomitant of glory, and thus, the more renowned he became, the greater was his caution and circumspection. He never went out to plunder, after the sudden attack of Jugurtha, with his troops in scattered parties; when corn or forage was sought, a body of cohorts, with the whole of the cavalry, were stationed as a guard. He himself conducted part of the army, and Marius the rest. The country was wasted, however, more by fire than by spoliation. They had separate camps, not far from each other; <pb n="140"/>whenever there was occasion for force, they formed a union; but, that desolation and terror might spread the further, they acted separately. Jugurtha, meanwhile, continued to follow them along the hills, watching for a favorable opportunity or situation for an attack. He destroyed the forage, and spoiled the water, which was scarce, wherever he found that the enemy were coming. He presented himself sometimes to Metellus, and sometimes to Marius; he would attack their rear upon a march, and instantly retreat to the hills; he would threaten sometimes one point, and sometimes another, neither giving battle nor allowing rest, but making it his great object to retard the progress of the enemy.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="56">
<p> The Roman commander, finding himself thus harassed by artifices, and allowed no opportunity of coming to a general engagement, resolved on laying siege to a large city, named Zama, which was the bulwark of that part of the kingdom in which it was situate; expecting that Jugurtha, as a necessary consequence, would come to the relief of his subjects in distress, and that a battle would then follow. But the king, being apprised by some deserters of the consul's design, reached the place, by rapid marches, before him, and exhorted the inhabitants to defend their walls, giving them, as a reinforcement, a body of deserters; a class of men, who, of all the royal forces, were the most to be trusted, inasmuch as they dared not be guilty of treachery.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LVI. Dared not be guilty of treachery] <quote lang="la">Fallere nequibant.</quote> <cit><quote>"Through dread of the severest punishments if they should fall into the hands of the Romans.

Hence it appears that the punishment of deserters was left to the pleasure of the general."</quote><bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></cit></note> He also promised to support them, whenever it should be necessary, with his whole army.</p>
<p>Having taken these precautions, he retired into the deserts of the interior; where he soon after learned that Marius, with a few cohorts, had been dispatched from the line of march to bring provisions from Sicca,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Sicca] It stood on the banks of the Bagradas, at some distance from the coast, and contained a celebrated Temple of Venus. Val. Max., ii. 6. D'Anville thinks it the same as the modern Kef.</note> a town which had been the first to revolt from him after his defeat. To this place he hastened by night, accompanied by a select body of cavalry, and attacked <pb n="141"/>the Romans at the gate, just as they were leaving the city; calling to the inhabitants, at the same time, with a loud voice, to surround the cohorts in the rear; adding, that Fortune had given them an opportunity for a glorious exploit; and that, if they took advantage of it, he would henceforth enjoy his kingdom, and they their liberty, without fear. And had not Marius hastened to advance the standards, and to escape from the town, it is certain that all, or the greater part of the inhabitants, would have changed their allegiance; so great is the fickleness which the Numidians exhibit in their conduct. The soldiers of Jugurtha, animated for a time by their king, but finding the enemy pressing them with superior force, betook themselves, after losing a few of their number, to flight.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="57">
<p> Marius arrived at Zama. This town, built on a plain, was better fortified by art than by nature. It was well supplied with necessaries, and contained plenty of arms and men. Metellus, having made arrangements suitable for the time and the place, encompassed the whole city with his army, assigning to each of his officers his post of command. At a given signal, a loud shout was raised on every side, but without exciting the least alarm in the Numidians, who awaited the attack full of spirit and resolution. The assault was consequently commenced; the Romans were allowed to act each according to his inclination; some annoyed the enemy with slings and stones from a distance; others came close up to the walls, and attempted to undermine or scale them, desiring to engage in close combat with the besieged. The Zamians, on the other hand, rolled down stones, and hurled burning stakes, javelins,<note anchored="yes" place="foot"> LVII. Javelins] <quote lang="la">Pila.</quote> This pilum may have been, as M&uuml;ller suggests, similar to the <foreign lang="la">falarica</foreign> which Livy (xxi. 8) says that the Saguntines used against their besiegers. <foreign lang="la">Falarica erat Saguntinis, missile telum hastili abieg no--id, sicut in pilo, quadratum stupp&acirc; circumligabant, linebantque pice:--quod cum medium accensum mitteretur,</foreign> etc. Of Sallust's other words, in the latter part of this sentence, the sense is clear, but the readings of different editors are extremely various.

Nor was caution a sufficient protection to those who kept aloof; for darts, discharged from engines or by the hand, inflicted wounds <pb n="142"/>on most of them; and thus the brave and the timid, though of unequal merit, were exposed to equal danger.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="58">
<p> While the struggle was thus continued at Zama, Jugurtha, at the head of a large force, suddenly attacked the camp of the Romans, and, through the remissness of those left to guard it, who expected any thing rather than an attack, effected an entrance at one of the gates. Our men, struck with sudden consternation, acted each on his own impulse; some fled, others seized their arms; and many of them were wounded or slain. About forty, however, out of the whole number, mindful of the honor of Rome, formed themselves into a body, and took possession of a slight eminence, from which they could not be dislodged by the utmost efforts of the enemy, but hurled back the darts discharged at them, and, as they were few against many, not without execution. If the Numidians came near them, they displayed their courage, and slaughtered, repulsed, and dispersed them, with the greatest fury. Metellus, meanwhile, who was vigorously pursuing the siege, heard a noise, as of enemies, in his rear, and, turning round his horse, perceived a party of soldiers in flight toward him; a certain proof that they were his own men. He instantly, therefore, dispatched the whole of the cavalry to the camp, and immediately after-ward Caius Marius, with the cohorts of the allies, entreating him with tears, by their mutual friendship, and by his regard for the public welfare, to allow no stain to rest on a victorious army, and not to let the enemy escape with impunity. Marius soon executed his orders. Jugurtha, in consequence, after being embarrassed in the intrenchments of the camp, while some of his men threw themselves over the ramparts, and others, in their haste, obstructed each other at the gates, fled, with considerable loss, to his strongholds, Metellus, not succeeding in his attempt on the town, retired with his forces, at the approach of night, into his camp.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="59">
<p> On the following day, before he marched out to resume the siege, he ordered the whole of his cavalry to take their station before the camp, on the side where the approach of Jugurtha was to be apprehended; assigning the gates, and adjoining posts, to the charge of the tribunes. He then marched toward the town, and commenced an assault upon the walls as on the day before. Jugurtha, meanwhile, issuing from his concealment, suddenly attacked our men in the camp, of whom those stationed <pb n="143"/>in advance were for the moment alarmed and thrown into confusion; but the rest soon came to their support; nor would the Numidians have longer maintained their ground, had not their foot, which were mingled with the cavalry, done great execution in the struggle; for the horse, relying on the infantry, did not, as is common in actions of cavalry, charge and then retreat, but pressed impetuously forward, disordering and breaking the ranks, and thus, with the aid of the light-armed foot, almost succeeded in giving the army a defeat.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LIX. And thus, with the aid of the light-armed foot, almost succeeded in giving the enemy a defeat] <quote lang="la">Ita expeditis peditibus suis hostes p&oelig;ne victos dare.</quote> Gortius, Kritzius, and Allen, concur in regarding <foreign lang="la">expedites peditibus</foreign> as an ablative of the instrument, i.e. as equivalent to <foreign lang="la">per expedites pedites,</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">victos dare</foreign> as nothing more than <foreign lang="la">vincere.</foreign> This appears to be the right mode of explanation; but most of the translators, French as well as English, have taken <foreign lang="la">expeditis peditibus</foreign> as a dative, and given to the passage the sense that "the cavalry delivered up the enemy, when nearly conquered, to be dispatched by the light-armed foot."</note></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="60">
<p> The conflict at Zama, at the same time, was continued with great fury. Wherever any lieutenant or tribune commanded, there the men exerted themselves with the utmost vigor. No one seemed to depend for support on others, but every one on his own exertions. The townsmen, on the other side, showed equal spirit. Attacks, or preparations for defense, were made in all quarters.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LX. Attacks, or preparations for defense, were made in all quarters] <quote lang="la">Oppugnare aut parare omnibus locis.</quote> There is much discussion among the critics whether these verbs are to be referred to the besiegers or the besieged.

There can be little doubt that they are spoken of both parties equally.</note> All appeared more eager to wound their enemies than to protect themselves. Shouts, mingled with exhortations, cries of joy, and the clashing of arms, resounded through the heavens. Darts flew thick on every side. If the besiegers, however, in the least relaxed their efforts, the defenders of the walls immediately turned their attention to the distant engagement of the cavalry; they were to be seen sometimes exhibiting joy, and sometimes apprehension, according to the varying fortune of Jugurtha, and, as if they could be heard or seen by their friends, uttering warnings or exhortations, making signs with their hands, and moving their bodies to and fro, like men avoiding or hurling darts. This being noticed by Marius, who commanded on that side of the town, he artfully relaxed his efforts, as if despairing of success, and allowed the besieged to view the battle at the camp unmolested. Then, while their <pb n="144"/>attention was closely fixed on their countrymen, he made a vigorous assault on the wall, and the soldiers mounting their scaling ladders, had almost gained the top, when the townsmen rushed to the spot in a body, and hurled down upon them stones, firebrands, and every description of missiles. Our men made head against these annoyances for a while, but at length, when some of the ladders were broken, and those who had mounted them dashed to the ground, the rest of the assailants retreated as they could, a few indeed unhurt, but the greater number miserably wounded. Night put an end to the efforts of both parties.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="61">
<p> When Metellus saw that all his attempts were vain; that the town was not to be taken; that Jugurtha was resolved to abstain from fighting, except from an ambush, or on his own ground, and that the summer was now far advanced, he withdrew his army from Zama, and placed garrisons in such of the cities that had revolted to him as were sufficiently strong in situation or fortifications. The rest of his forces he settled in winter quarters, in that part of our province nearest to Numidia.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXI.

But it is to be understood that Metellus did not distribute his troops through the whole of the province, but in that part which is nearest to Numidia, in order that they might be easily assembled in case of an attack of the enemy or any other emergency. There is, therefore, no need to read with the Bipont edition and M&uuml;ller, <foreign lang="la">qu&agrave; proxima,</foreign> etc. though this is in itself not a bad conjecture."</quote><bibl>Kritzius.</bibl></cit></note></p>
<p>This season of repose, however, he did not, like other commanders, abandon to idleness and luxury; but as the war had been but slowly advanced by fighting, he resolved to try the effect of treachery on the king through his friends, and to employ their perfidy instead of arms. He accordingly addressed himself with large promises, to Bomilcar, the same nobleman who had been with Jugurtha at Rome, and who had fled from thence, notwithstanding he had given bail, to escape being tried for the murder of Massiva; selecting this person for his instrument, because, from his great intimacy with Jugurtha, he had the best opportunities of betraying him. He prevailed on him, in the first place, to come to a conference with him privately, when, having given him his word, "that, if he should deliver up Jugurtha, alive or dead, the senate would grant him a pardon, <pb n="145"/>and the full possession of his property," he easily brought him over to his purpose, especially as he was naturally faithless, and also apprehensive that, if peace were made with the Romans, he himself would be surrendered to justice by the terms of it.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="62">
<p> Bomilcar took the earliest opportunity of addressing Jugurtha, at a time when he was full of anxiety, and lamenting his ill success. He exhorted and implored him, with tears in his eyes, to take at length some thought for himself and his children, as well as for the people of Numidia, who had so much claim upon him. He reminded him that they had been defeated in every battle; that the country was laid waste; that numbers of his subjects had been captured or slain; that the resources of the kingdom were greatly reduced; that the valor of his soldiers, and his own fortune, had been already sufficiently tried; and that he should beware, lest, if he delayed to consult for his people, his people should consult for themselves. By these and similar appeals, he prevailed with Jugurtha to think of a surrender. Embassadors were accordingly sent to the Roman general, announcing that Jugurtha was ready to submit to whatever he should desire, and to trust himself and his kingdom unconditionally to his honor. Metellus, on receiving this statement, summoned such of his officers as were of senatorial rank, from their winter quarters; of whom, with others whom he thought eligible, he formed a council. By a resolution of this assembly, in conformity with ancient usage, he demanded of Jugurtha, through his embassadors, two hundred thousand pounds' weight of silver, all his elephants, and a portion of his horses and arms. These requisitions being immediately complied with, he next desired that all the deserters should be brought to him in chains. A large number of them were accordingly brought; but a few, when the surrender first began to be mentioned, had fled into Mauretania to king Bocchus.</p>
<p>When Jugurtha, however, after being thus despoiled of arms, men and money, was summoned to appear in person at Tisidium,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXII. Was summoned to appear in person at Tisidium, etc.] <quote lang="la">C&ugrave;m ipse  ad imperandum Tisidium vocaretur.</quote> The gerund is used, as grammarians say, in a passive sense. <cit><quote>"The town of Tisidium is nowhere else mentioned.

punishment due to his crimes. Having spent several days in hesitation, sometimes, from disgust at his ill success, believing any thing better than war, and sometimes considering with himself how grievous would be the fall from sovereignty to slavery, he at last determined, notwithstanding that he had lost so many and so valuable means of resistance, to commence hostilities anew.</p>
<p>At Rome, meanwhile, the senate, having been consulted about the provinces, had decreed Numidia to Metellus.</p></div1>

<p> About the same time, as Caius Marius, who happened to be at Utica, was sacrificing to the gods,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXIII.

Previously to this period an ardent longing for the consulship had possessed him; and he had, indeed, every qualification for obtaining it, except antiquity of family; he had industry, integrity, great knowledge of war, and a spirit undaunted in the field; he was temperate in private life, superior to pleasure and riches, and ambitious only of glory. Having been born at Arpinum, and brought up there during his boyhood, he employed himself, as soon as he was of age to bear arms, not in the study of Greek eloquence, nor in learning the refinements of the city, but in military service; and thus, amid the strictest discipline, his excellent genius soon attained full vigor. When he solicited the people, therefore, for the military tribuneship, he was well known by name, though most were strangers to his face, and unanimously elected by the tribes. After this office he attained others in succession, and conducted himself so well in his public duties, that he was always deemed worthy of a higher station than he had reached. Yet, though such had been his character hitherto (for he was afterward carried away by ambition), he had not ventured to stand for the consulship.

<p> But when Marius found that the words of the augur pointed in the same direction as his own inclinations prompted him, he requested of Metellus leave of absence, that he might offer himself a candidate for the consulship. Metellus, though eminently distinguished by virtue, honor, and other qualities valued by the good, had yet a haughty and disdainful spirit, the common failing of the nobility. He was at first, therefore, astonished at so extraordinary an application, expressed surprise at Marius's views, and advised him, as if in friendship, "not to indulge such unreasonable expectations, or elevate his thoughts above his station; that all things were not to be coveted by all men; that his present condition ought to satisfy him; and, finally, that he should be cautious of asking from the Roman people what they might justly refuse him." Having made these and similar remarks, and finding that the resolution of Marius was not at all affected by them, he told him "that he would grant what he desired as soon as the public business would allow him."<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXIV. As soon as the public business would allow him] <quote lang="la">Ubi prim&ugrave;m potuisset per negotia publica.</quote> As soon as he could through (regard to) the public business.</note> On Marius repeating his request several times afterward, he is reported to have said, "that he need not be in a hurry to go, as he would be soon enough if he became a candidate with his own son."<note anchored="yes" place="foot">With his own son] <quote lang="la">Cum filio suo.</quote> With the son of Metellus.

<p>This taunt served only to rouse the feelings of Marius, as <pb n="148"/>
well for the honor at which he aimed, as against Metellus. He suffered himself to be actuated, therefore, by ambition and resentment, the worst of counselors. He omitted nothing henceforward, either in deeds or words, that could increase his own popularity. He allowed the soldiers, of whom he had the command in the winter quarters, more relaxation of discipline than he had ever granted them before. He talked of the war among the merchants, of whom there was a great number at Utica, censoriously with respect to Metellus, and vauntingly with regard to himself; saying "that if but half of the army were granted him, he would in a few days have Jugurtha in chains; but that the war was purposely protracted by the consul, because, being a man of vanity and regal pride, he was too fond of the delights of power." All these assertions appeared the more credible to the merchants, as, by the long continuance of the war, they had suffered in their fortunes; and to impatient minds no haste is sufficient.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="65">
<p> There was then in our army a Numidian named Gauda, the son of Mastanabal, and grandson of Masinissa, whom Micipsa, in his will, had appointed next heir to his immediate successors. This man had been debilitated by ill-health, and, from the effect of it, was somewhat impaired in his understanding. He had petitioned Metellus to allow him a seat, like a prince, next to himself, and a troop of horse for a bodyguard; but Metellus had refused him both; the seat, because it was granted only to those whom the Roman people had addressed as kings, and the guard, because it would be an indignity to Roman cavalry to act as guards to a Numidian. While Gauda was discontented at these refusals, Marius paid him a visit, and prompted him, with his assistance, to seek revenge for the affronts put upon him by the general; inflating his mind, which was as weak as his body,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXV.

<p> Jugurtha, meantime, who, after relinquishing his intention to surrender, had renewed the war, was now hastening the preparations for it with the utmost diligence.

<p>Induced by the entreaties of their king, from whom, indeed, they had never been alienated in affection, the leading inhabitants of Vacca, a city in which Metellus, when Jugurtha began to treat for peace, had placed a garrison, entered into a conspiracy against the Romans. As for the common people of the town, they were, as is generally the case, and especially among the Numidians, of a fickle disposition, factious and turbulent, and therefore already desirous of a change, and adverse to peace and quiet. Having arranged their plans, they fixed upon the third day following for the execution of them, because that day, being a festival, celebrated throughout Africa, would promise merriment and dissipation rather than alarm. When the time came, they invited the centurions and military tribunes, <pb n="150"/>
with Titus Turpilius Silanus, the governor of the town, to their several houses, and butchered them all, except Turpilius, at their banquets; and then fell upon the common soldiers, who, as was to be expected on such a day, when discipline was relaxed, were wandering about without their arms. The populace followed the example of their chiefs, some of them having been previously instructed to do so, and others induced by a liking for such disorders, and, though ignorant of what had been done or intended, finding sufficient gratification in tumult and variety.</p></div1>

Whether his flight was the consequence of compassion in his entertainer, of compact, or of chance, I have never discovered; but since, in such a general massacre, he preferred inglorious safety to an honorable name, he seems to have been a worthless and infamous character.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Worthless and infamous character] <quote lang="la">Improbus intestabilisque.</quote> These words are taken from the twelve tables of the Roman law: See Aul.

<p> When Metellus heard of what had happened at Vacca, he retired for a time, overpowered with sorrow, from the public gaze; but at length, as indignation mingled with his <pb n="151"/>
grief, he hastened, with the utmost spirit, to take vengeance for the outrage. He led forth, at sunset, the legion that was in winter quarters with him, and as many Numidian horse as he could, and arrived, about the third hour on the following day, at a certain plain surrounded by rising grounds. Here he acquainted the soldiers, who were now exhausted with the length of their march, and averse to further exertion,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXVIII. Averse to further exertion] <quote lang="la">Tum abnuentes omnia.</quote> Most of the translators have understood by these words that the troops refused to obey orders; but Sallust's meaning is only that they expressed, by looks and gestures, their unwillingness to proceed.</note> that the town of Vacca was not above a mile distant, and that it became them to bear patiently the toil that remained, with the hope of exacting revenge for their countrymen, the bravest and most unfortunate of men. He likewise generously promised them the whole of the plunder. Their courage being thus revived, he ordered them to resume their march, the cavalry maintaining an extended line in front, and the infantry, with their standards concealed, keeping the closest order behind.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="69">
<p> The people of Vacca, perceiving an army coming toward them, judged rightly at first that it was Metellus, and shut their gates; but, after a while, when they saw that their fields were not laid waste, and that the front consisted of Numidian cavalry, they imagined that it was Jugurtha, and went out with great joy to meet him. A signal being immediately given, both cavalry and infantry commenced an attack; some cut down the multitude pouring from the town, others hurried to the gates, others secured the towers, revenge and the hope of plunder prevailing over their weariness. Thus Vacca triumphed only two days in its treachery; the whole city, which was great and opulent, was given up to vengeance and spoliation. Turpilius, the governor, whom we mentioned as the only person that escaped, was summoned by Metellus to answer for his conduct, and not being able to clear himself, was condemned, as a native of Latium,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXIX As a native of Latium] <quote lang="la">Nam is civis ex Latio erat.</quote> <cit><quote>"As he was a Latin, he was not protected by the Porcian law (see Cat., c. 51), though how far this law had power in the camp, is not agreed."</quote><bibl>Allen.</bibl></cit> Gerlach thinks that it had the same power in the camp as elsewhere, with reference to Roman citizens. But Roman citizenship was not extended to the Latins till the end of the Social War,  A.U.C. 662. Plutarch, however, in his Life of Caius Gracchus (c. 9), speaks of Livius Drusus having been abetted by the patricians in proposing a law for exempting the Latin soldiers from being flogged, about thirty years earlier; and it seems to have been passed, but, from this passage of Sallust, appears not to have remained in force. Lipsius touches on this obscure point in his <foreign lang="la">Militia Romana,</foreign> v. 18, but settles nothing.
Plutarch, in his Life of Marius, c. 8, says that Turpilius was an old retainer of the family of Metellus, whom he attended, in this war, as <foreign lang="la">pr&oelig;fectus f&oelig;br&ucirc;m,</foreign> or master of the artificers; that, being afterward appointed governor of Vacca, he exercised his office with great justice and humanity; that his life was spared by Jugurtha at the solicitation of the inhabitants that, when he was brought to trial, Metellus thought him innocent, and that he would not have been condemned but for the malice of Marius, who exasperated the other members of the council against him. He adds, that after his death, his innocence became apparent, and that Marius boasted of having planted in the breast of Metellus an avenging fury, that would not fail to torment him for having put to death the innocent friend of his family. Hence Sir Henry Steuart has accused Sallust of wilfully misrepresenting the character of Turpilius, as well as the whole transaction. But as much credit is surely due to Sallust as to Plutarch.</note> to be scourged and put to death.

<div1 type="chapter" n="70">
<p> About this time, Bomilcar, at whose persuasion Jugurtha had entered upon the capitulation which he had discontinued through fear, being distrusted by the king, and distrusting him in return, grew desirous of a change of government. He accordingly meditated schemes for Jugurtha's destruction, racking his invention night and day. At last, to leave nothing untried, he sought an accomplice in Nabdalsa, a man of noble birth and great wealth, who was in high regard and favor with his countrymen, and who, on most occasions, used to command a body of troops distinct from those of the king, and to transact all business to which Jugurtha, from fatigue, or from being occupied with more important matters, was unable to attend ;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXX.

By these two men in concert, a day was fixed for the execution of their treachery; succeeding matters they agreed to settle as the exigences of the moment might require. Nabdalsa then proceeded to join his troops, which he kept in readiness, according to orders, among the winter quarters of the Romans,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Among the winter-quarters of the Romans] <quote lang="la">Inter hiberna Romanorum.</quote> It is stated in c. 61, as Kritzius observes, that Metellus, when he put his army into winter-quarters, had, at the same time, placed garrisons in such of Jugurtha's towns as had revolted to him. The forces of the Romans being thus dispersed, Nabdalsa might justly be said to have his army <foreign lang="la">inter hiberna,</foreign> "among their winter-quarters."</note> to prevent the country from being ravaged by the enemy with impunity.</p>
<p>But as Nabdalsa, growing alarmed at the magnitude of the <pb n="153"/>
undertaking, failed to appear at the appointed time, and allowed his fears to hinder their plans, Bomilcar, eager for their execution, and disquieted at the timidity of his associate, lest he should relinquish his original intentions and adopt some new course, sent him a letter by some confidential person, in which he "reproached him with pusillanimity and irresolution, and conjured him by the gods, by whom he had sworn, not to turn the offers of Metellus to his own destruction;" assuring him " that the fall of Jugurtha was approaching; that the only thing to be considered was whether he should perish by their hand or by that of Metellus; and that, in consequence, he might consider whether to choose rewards, or death by torture."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="71">
<p> It happened that when this letter was brought, Nabdalsa, overcome with fatigue, was reposing on his couch, where, after reading Bomilcar's letter, anxiety at first, and afterward, as is usual with a troubled mind, sleep overpowered him. In his service there was a certain Numidian, the manager of his affairs, a person who possessed his confidence and esteem, and who was acquainted with all his designs except the last. He, hearing that a letter had arrived, and supposing that there would be occasion, as usual, for his assistance or suggestions, went into the tent, and, while his master was asleep, took up the letter thrown carelessly upon the cushion behind his head,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXI. Behind his head] <quote lang="la">Super caput.</quote> On the back of the bolster that supported his head; part of which might be higher than the head itself.</note> and read it; and, having thus discovered the plot, set off in haste to Jugurtha. Nabdalsa, who awoke soon after, missing the letter, and hearing of the whole affair, and how it had happened, at first attempted to pursue the informer, but finding that pursuit was vain, he went himself to Jugurtha to try to appease him; saying that the disclosure which he intended to make, had been anticipated by the perfidy of his servant; and beseeching him with tears, by his friendship, and by his own former proofs of fidelity, not to think that he could be guilty of such treachery.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="72">
<p> To these entreaties the king replied with a mildness far different from his real feelings. After putting to death Bomilcar, and many others whom he knew to be privy to the plot, he refrained from any further manifestation of resentment, lest an insurrection should be the consequence of it. But after this <pb n="154"/>
occurrence he had no peace either by day or by night; he thought himself safe neither in any place, nor with any person, nor at any time; he feared his subjects and his enemies alike; he was always on the watch, and was startled at every sound; he passed the night sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another, and often in places little suited to royal dignity; and sometimes, starting from his sleep, he would seize his arms and raise an alarm. He was indeed so agitated by extreme terror, that he appeared under the influence of madness.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="73">
<p> Metellus, hearing from some deserters of the fate of Bomilcar, and the discovery of the conspiracy, made fresh preparations for action, and with the utmost dispatch, as if entering upon an entirely new war. Marius, who was still importuning him for leave of absence, he allowed to go home; thinking that as he served with reluctance, and bore him personal enmity, he was not likely to prove a very useful officer.</p>
<p>The common people at Rome, having learned the contents of the letters written from Africa concerning Metellus and Marius, had listened to the accounts given of both with eagerness. But the noble birth of Metellus, which had previously been a motive for paying him honor, had now become a cause of unpopularity; while the obscurity of Marius's origin had procured him favor. In regard to both, however, party feeling had more influence than the good or bad qualities of either. The factious tribunes,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXIII. The factious tribunes] <quote lang="la">Seditiosi magistratus.</quote></note> too, inflamed the populace, charging Metellus, in their harangues, with offenses worthy of death, and exaggerating the excellent qualities of Marius. At length the people were so excited that all the artisans and rustics, whose whole subsistence and credit depended on their labor, quitting their several employments, attended Marius in crowds, and thought less of their own wants than of his exaltation. Thus the nobility being borne down, the consulship, after the lapse of many years,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">After the lapse of many years] <quote lang="la">Post multas tempestates.</quote> Apparently the period since  A.U.C. 611, when Quintus Pompeius, who, as Cicero says (in Verr. ii. 5). was <foreign lang="la">humile atque obscuro loco natus,</foreign> obtained the consulship; that is, a term of forty-three or forty-four years.</note> was once more given to a man of humble birth. And afterward, when the people were asked by Manilius Mancinus, one of their tribunes, whom they would appoint to carry on the war against Jugurtha, they, in a full assembly, voted it to Marius. The <pb n="155"/>
senate had previously decreed it to Metellus; but that decree was thus rendered abortive.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">That decree was thus rendered abortive] <quote lang="la">Ea res frustra fuit.</quote> By a <foreign lang="la">ex Sempronia,</foreign> a law of Caius Gracchus, it was enacted that the senate should fix the provinces for the future consuls before the <foreign lang="la">comitia</foreign> for electing them were held. But from Jug. c. 26, it appears that the consuls might settle by lot, or by agreement between themselves, which of those two provinces each of them should take. How far the senate were allowed or accustomed in general, to interfere in the arrangement, it is not easy to discover; but on this occasion they had taken on themselves to pass a resolution in favor of the patrician. Lest similar scenes, however, to those of the Sempronian times should be enacted, they yielded the point to the people.</note></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="74">
<p> During this period, Jugurtha, as he was bereft of his friends (of whom he had put to death the greater number, while the rest, under the influence of terror, had fled partly to the Romans, and partly to Bocchus), as the war, too, could not be carried on without officers, and as he thought it dangerous to try the faith of new ones after such perfidy among the old, was involved in doubt and perplexity; no scheme, no counsel, no person could satisfy him; he changed his route and his captains daily; he hurried sometimes against the enemy, and some-times toward the deserts; depended at one time on flight, and at another on resistance; and was unable to decide whether he could less trust the courage or the fidelity of his subjects. Thus, in whatever direction he turned his thoughts, the prospect was equally disheartening.</p>
<p>In the midst of his irresolution, Metellus suddenly made his appearance with his army. The Numidians were assembled and drawn up by Jugurtha, as well as time permitted; and a battle was at once commenced. Where the king commanded in person, the struggle was maintained for some time; but the rest of his force was routed and put to flight at the first onset. The Romans took a considerable number of standards and arms, but not many prisoners; for, in almost every battle, their feet afforded more security to the Numidians than their swords.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="75">
<p> In consequence of this defeat, Jugurtha, feeling less confidence in the state of his affairs than ever, retreated with the deserters, and part of his cavalry, first into the deserts, and afterward to Thala,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXV. Thala] The river on which this town stood is not named by Sallust, but it appears to have been the Bagrada. It seems to have been nearly destroyed by the Romans, after the defeat of Juba, in the time of Julius C&aelig;sar; though Tacitus, Ann. iii. 21, mentions it as having afforded a refuge to the Romans in the insurrection of the Numidian chief, Tacfarinas. D'Anville and Dr, Shaw, Travels in Bombay, vol. i. pt. 2, ch. 5, think it the same with Telepte, now <foreign lang="la">Ferre-anah;</foreign> but this is very doubtful. See Cellar. iv. 5. It was in ruins in the time of Strabo.</note> a large and opulent city, where lay the <pb n="156"/>
greater portion of his treasures, and where there was magnificent provision for the education of his children. When Metellus was informed of this, although he knew that there was, between Thala and the nearest river, a dry and desert region fifty miles broad, yet, in the hope of finishing the war if he should gain possession of the town, he resolved to surmount all difficulties, and to conquer even Nature herself. He gave orders that the beasts of burden, therefore, should be lightened of all the baggage excepting ten days' provision; and that they should be laden with skins and other utensils for holding water. He also collected from the fields as many laboring cattle as he could find, and loaded them with vessels of all sorts, but chiefly wooden, taken from the cottages of the Numidians. He directed such of the neighboring people, too, as had submitted to him after the retreat of Jugurtha, to bring him as much water as they could carry, appointing a time and a place for them to be in attendance. He then loaded his beasts from the river, which, as I have intimated, was the nearest water to the town, and, thus provided, set out for Thala.</p>
<p>When he came to the place at which he had desired the Numidians to meet him, and had pitched and fortified his camp, so copious a fall of rain is said to have happened, as would have furnished more than sufficient water for his whole army. Provisions, too, were brought him far beyond his expectations; for the Numidians, like most people after a recent surrender, had done more than was required of them.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Had done more than was required of them] <quote lang="la">Officia intenderant.</quote> <foreign lang="la">"Auxit intenditque s&aelig;vitiam exacerbatus indicio filii sui Drusi."</foreign> Suet. Tib. 62.</note> The men, however, from a religious feeling, preferred using the rain-water; the fall of which greatly increased their courage, for they thought themselves the peculiar care of the gods. On the next day, to the surprise of Jugurtha, they arrived at Thala. The inhabitants, who thought themselves secured by the difficulties of the approach to them, were astonished at so strange and unexpected a sight, but, nevertheless, prepared for their defense. Our men showed equal alacrity on their side.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="76">
<p> But Jugurtha himself, believing that to Metellus, who, by his exertions, had triumphed over every obstacle, over arms, deserts, seasons, and finally over Nature herself that controls all, nothing was impossible, fled with his children, and a <pb n="157"/>

<p>Metellus, seeing that the people of Thala were determined on resistance, and that the town was defended both by art and situation, surrounded the walls with a rampart and a trench. He then directed his machines against the most eligible points, threw up a mound, and erected towers upon it to protect<note anchored="yes" place="foot">And erected towns upon it to protect, etc.] <quote lang="la">Et super aggerem impositis turribus opus et administros tutari.</quote> "And protected the work and the workmen with towers placed on the mound." <foreign lang="la">Impositis turribus</foreign> is not the ablative absolute, but the ablative of the instrument.</note> the works and the workmen. The townsmen, on the other hand, were exceedingly active and diligent; and nothing was neglected on either side. At last the Romans, though exhausted with much previous fatigue and fighting, got possession, forty days after their arrival, of the town, and the town only; for all the spoil had been destroyed by the deserters; who, when they saw the walls shaken by the battering-ram, and their own situation desperate, had conveyed the gold and silver, and whatever else is esteemed valuable, to the royal palace, where, after being sated with wine and luxuries, they destroyed the treasures, the building, and themselves, by fire, and thus voluntarily submitted to the sufferings which, in case of being conquered, they dreaded at the hands of the enemy.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="77">
<p> At the very time that Thala was taken, there came to Metellus embassadors from the city of Leptis,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXVII.

<p> Since the affairs of Leptis have led me into these regions, it will not be foreign to my subject to relate the noble <pb n="159"/>
and singular act of two Carthaginians, which the place has brought to my recollection.</p>
<p>At the time when the Carthaginians were masters of the greater part of Africa, the Cyrenians were also a great and powerful people. The territory that lay betweem them was sandy, and of a uniform appearance, without a stream or a hill to determine their respective boundaries; a circumstance which involved them in a severe and protracted war. After armies and fleets had been routed and put to flight on both sides, and each people had greatly weakened their opponents, fearing lest some third party should attack both victors and vanquished in a state of exhaustion, they came to an agreement, during a short cessation of arms, "that on a certain day deputies should leave home on either side, and that the spot where they should meet should be the common boundary between the two states." From Carthage, accordingly, were dispatched two brothers, who were named Phil&aelig;ni,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXIX. Phil&aelig;ni] The account of these Carthaginian brothers with a Greek name, <foreign lang="greek">fi/lainoi,</foreign> praise-loving, is probably a fable. Cortius thinks that the inhabitants, observing two mounds rising above the surrounding level, fancied they must have been raised, not by nature, but by human labor, and invented a story to account for their existence. " The altars," according to Mr. Rennell (Geog. of Herod., p. 640), " were situated about seven ninths of the way from Carthage to Cyrene; and the deception," he adds, "would have been too gross, had it been pretended that the Carthaginian party had traveled seven parts in nine, while the Cyrenians had traveled no more than two such parts of the way." Pliny (H. N. v. 4) says that the altars were of sand; Strabo (lib. iii.) says that in his time they had vanished.

<p> After the loss of Thala, Jugurtha, thinking no place sufficiently secure against Metellus, fled with a few followers into the country of the Getulians, a people savage and uncivilized, and, at that period, unacquainted with even the name of Rome. Of these barbarians he collected a great multitude, and trained them by degrees to march in ranks, to follow standards, to obey the word of command, and to perform other military exercises. He also gained over to his interest, by large presents and larger promises, the intimate friends of king Bocchus, and working upon the king by their means, induced him to commence war against the Romans. This was the more practicable and easy, because Bocchus, at the commencement of hostilities with Jugurtha, had sent an embassy to Rome to solicit friendship and allliance; but a faction, blinded by avarice, and accustomed to sell their votes on every question honorable or dishonorable,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXX.

<p> The two kings, with their armies,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXXI. The two kings, with their armies] The text has only <quote lang="la">exercitus.</quote></note> met in a place settled by mutual agreement, where, after pledges of amity were given and received, Jugurtha inflamed the mind of Bocchus by observing " that the Romans were a lawless people, of insatiable covetousness, and the common enemies of mankind; that they had the same motive for making war on Bocchus as on himself and other nations, the lust of dominion; that all independent states were objects of hatred to them; at present, for instance, himself; a little before, the Carthaginians had been so, as well as king Perses; and that, in future, as any sovereign became conspicuous for his power, so would he assuredly be treated as an enemy by the Romans."</p>
<p>Induced by these and similar considerations, they determined to march against Cirta, where Metellus had deposited his plunder, prisoners, and baggage. Jugurtha supposed that, if he took the city, there would be ample recompense for his exertions; or that, if the Roman general came to succor his adherents, he would have the opportunity of engaging him in the field. He also hastened this movement from policy, to lessen Bocchus's chance of peace;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">To lessen Bocchus's chance of peace] <quote lang="la">Bocchi pacem imminuere.</quote> He wished to engage Bocchus in some act of hostility against the Romans, so as to render any coalition between them impossible.</note> lest, if delay should be allowed, he should decide upon something different from war.</p></div1>

<p>In the mean time he was informed, by letters from Rome, that the province of Numidia was assigned to Marius, of whose election to the consulship he had already heard.</p>
<p>Being affected at these occurrences beyond what was proper and decorous, he could neither restrain his tears nor govern his tongue; for though he was a man eminent in other respects, he had too little firmness in bearing trouble of mind. His irritation was by some imputed to pride; others said that a noble spirit was wounded by insult; many thought him chagrined because victory, just attained, was snatched from his grasp. But to me it is well known that he was more troubled at the honor bestowed on Marius than at the injustice done to himself; and that he would have shown much less uneasiness if the province of which he was deprived had been given to any other than Marius.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="83">
<p> Discouraged, therefore, by such a mortification, and thinking it folly to promote another man's success at his own hazard, he sent deputies to Bocchus, entreating him " not to become an enemy to the Romans without cause ;" and observing " that he had a fine opportunity of entering into friendship and alliance with them, which were far preferable to war; that though he might have confidence in his resources, he ought not to change certainties for uncertainties; that a war was easily begun, but discontinued with difficulty; that its commencement and conclusion were not dependent on the same party; that any one, even a coward, might commence hostilities, but that they could be broken off only when the conqueror thought proper; and that he should therefore consult for his interest and that of his kingdom, and not connect his own prosperous circumstances with the ruined fortunes of Jugurtha." To these representations the king mildly answered, "that he desired peace, but felt compassion for the condition of Jugurtha, to whom if similar proposals were made, all would easily be arranged." Metellus, in reply to this request of <pb n="163"/>
Bocchus, sent deputies with overtures, of which the king approved some, and rejected others. Thus, in sending messengers to and fro, the time passed away, and the war, according to the consul's desire, was protracted without being advanced.</p></div1>

<p> Marius, who, as I said before, had been made consul with great eagerness on the part of the populace, began, though he had always been hostile to the patricians, to inveigh against them, after the people gave him the province of Numidia, with great frequency and violence; he attacked them sometimes individually and sometimes in a body; he said that he had snatched from them the consulship as spoils from vanquished enemies; and uttered other remarks laudatory to himself and offensive to them. Meanwhile he made the provision for the war his chief object; he asked for reinforcements for the legions; he sent for auxiliaries from foreign states, kings, and allies; he also enlisted all the bravest men from Latium, most of whom were known to him by actual service, some few only by report, and induced, by earnest solicitation, even discharged veterans<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXXIV.

Marius himself, too, had excited them in no small degree by a speech; for, when all that he required was granted, and he was anxious to commence a levy, he called an assembly of the people, as well to encourage them to enlist, as to inveigh, according to his practice, against the nobility. He spoke, on the occasion, as follows:</p></div1>

Setting out, accordingly, for Africa, with a somewhat larger force than had been decreed, he arrived in a few days at Utica. The command of the army was resigned to him by Publius Rutilius, Metullus's lieutenant-general; for Metullus himself avoided the sight of Marius, that he might not see what he could not even endure to hear mentioned.</p></div1>

<p>Marius continued to attend, with equal activity and prudence, to his own affairs and those of the enemy. He observed what would be advantageous, or the contrary, to either party; he watched the movements of the kings, counteracted their intentions and stratagems, and allowed no remissness in his own army, and no security in that of the enemy. He accordingly attacked and dispersed, on several occasions, the Getulians and Jugurtha on their march, as they were carrying off spoil from our allies ;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXXVIII.

As to Bocchus, he had frequently sent messengers to Marius, saying that he desired the friendship of the Roman people, and that the consul need fear no act of hostility from him.

<p> Marius, as he had determined, proceeded to <pb n="174"/>attack the fortified towns and places of strength, and to detach them, partly by force, and partly by threats or offers of reward, from the enemy. His operations in this way, however, were at first but moderate; for he expected that Jugurtha, to protect his subjects, would soon come to an engagement. But finding that he kept at a distance, and was intent on other affairs, he thought it was time to enter upon something of greater importance and difficulty. Amid the vast deserts there lay a great and strong city, named Capsa, the founder of which is said to have been the Libyan Hercules.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">LXXXIX.

At the end of six days, accordingly, when he arrived at the river, a large number of bottles had been prepared. Having pitched his camp, with a slight fortification, he ordered his men to take refreshment, and to be ready to resume their march at sunset; and, having laid aside all their baggage, to load themselves and their beasts only with water. As soon as it seemed time, he quitted the camp, and, after marching the whole night,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XCI.

He himself immediately followed, with the utmost ardor, restraining his men from plunder.</p>
<p>When the inhabitants perceived that the place was surprised, their state of consternation and extreme dread, the suddenness of the calamity, and the consideration that many of their fellow-citizens were without the walls in the power of the enemy, compelled them to surrender. The town, however, was burned; of the Numidians, such as were of adult age, were put to the sword; the rest were sold, and the spoil divided among the soldiers. This severity, in violation of the usages of war, was not adopted from avarice or cruelty in the consul, but was exercised because the place was of great advantage to Jugurtha, and difficult of access to us, while the inhabitants were a fickle and faithless race, to be influenced neither by kindness nor by terror.</p></div1>

<p> Marius having thus wasted much time and labor, <pb n="178"/>began seriously to consider whether he should abandon the attempt as impracticable, or wait for the aid of Fortune, whom he had so often found favorable.

Burnouf, with Havercamp and the editions antecedent to Cortius reads <foreign lang="la">more human&oelig; cupidinis ignara visundi animum vortit,</foreign> of which the first five words are taken from a quotation of Aulus Gellius, ix. 12, who, however, may have transcribed them from some other part of Sallust's works, now lost.</note> took violent possession of him.

Raising himself sometimes on the boughs of this tree, and sometimes on the projecting rocks, the Ligurian, as all the Numidians were intently watching the besiegers, took a full survey of the platform of the fortress. Having observed whatever he thought it would afterward prove useful to know, he descended the same way, rot unobservantly, as he had gone up, but exploring <pb n="179"/>and noticing all the peculiarities of the path. He then hastened to Marius, acquainted him with what he had done, and urged him to attack the fort on that side where he had ascended, offering himself to lead the way and the attempt. Marius sent some of those about him, along with the Ligurian, to examine the practicability of his proposal, who, according to their several dispositions, reported the affair as difficult or easy. The consul's hopes, however, were somewhat encouraged; and he accordingly selected, from his band of trumpeters and bugle-men, five of the most nimble, and with them four centurions for a guard;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Four centurions for a guard] <quote lang="la">Pr&oelig;sidio qui forest, quatuor centuriones.</quote> It is a question among the commentators whether the centurions were attended by their centuries or not; Cortius thinks that they were not, as ten men were sufficient to cause an alarm in the fortress, which was all that Marius desired. But that Cortius is in the wrong, and that there were common soldiers with the centurions, appears from the following considerations: 1. Marius would hardly have sent, or Sallust have spoken of, four men as a guard to six. 2. Why should centurions only have been selected, and not common soldiers as well as their officers? 3. An expression in the following chapter, <foreign lang="la">laqueis--quibus allevati milites facilius escenderent,</foreign> seems to prove that there were others present besides the centurions and the trumpeters. The word <foreign lang="la">milites</foreign> is indeed wanting in the text of Cortius, but appears to have been omitted by him merely to favor his own notion as to the absence of soldiers, for he left it out, as Kritzius says, <foreign lang="la">summ&acirc; libidine, ne uno quidem codice assentiente,</foreign> "purely of his own will, and without the authority of a single manuscript."

<p>Though Marius had kept the attention of the Numidians, during the whole day, fixed on his attacks, yet, when he heard from his scouts how the Ligurian had succeeded, he animated his soldiers to fresh exertions, and he himself, advancing beyond the vine&aelig;, and causing a testudo to be formed,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Causing a testudo to be formed] <quote lang="la">Testudine act&acirc;.</quote> The soldiers placed their shields over their heads, and joined them close together, forming a defense like the shell of a tortoise.</note> came up close under the walls, annoying the enemy, at the same time, with his engines, archers, and slingers, from a distance.</p>
<p>But the Numidians, having often before overturned and burned the vine&aelig; of the Romans, no longer confined themselves within the fortress, but spent day and night before the walls, railing at the Romans, upbraiding Marius with madness, threatening our soldiers with being made slaves to Jugurtha, and exhibiting the utmost audacity on account of their successful defense. In the mean time, while both the Romans and Numidians were engaged in the struggle, the one side contending for glory and dominion, the other for their very existence, the trumpets suddenly sounded a blast in the rear of the enemy, at <pb n="181"/>which the women and children, who had gone out to view the contest, were the first to flee; next those who were nearest to the wall, and at length the whole of the Numidians, armed and unarmed, retreated within the fort. When this had happened, the Romans pressed upon the enemy with increased boldness, dispersing them, and at first only wounding the greater part, but afterward making their way over the bodies of those who fell, thirsting for glory, and striving who should be first to reach the wall; not a single individual being detained by the plunder. Thus the rashness of Marius, rendered successful by fortune, procured him renown from his very error.</p></div1>

<p> During the progress of this affair, Lucius Sylla, Marius's qu&aelig;stor, arrived in the camp with a numerous body of cavalry, which he had been left at Rome to raise among the Latins and allies.</p>

About a hundred and fifty fragments of his history remain.</note> who has treated that subject the most ably and accurately of all writers, seems to me to have spoken with too little freedom. Sylla, then, was of patrician descent, but of a family almost sunk in obscurity by the degeneracy of his forefathers. He was skilled, equally and profoundly, in Greek and Roman literature. He was a man of large mind, fond of pleasure, but fonder of glory. His leisure was spent in luxurious gratifications, but pleasure never kept him from his duties, except that he might have acted more for his honor with regard to his wife.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Except that he might have acted more for his honor with regard to his wife] <quote lang="la">Nisi quod de uxore potuit honestius consuli.</quote> As these words are vague and indeterminate, it is not agreed among the critics and translators to what part of Sylla's life Sallust refers. I suppose, with Rupertus, Aldus, Manutius, Crispinus, and De Brosses, that the allusion is to his connection with Valeria, of which the history is given by Plutarch in his life of Sylla, which the English reader may take in Langhorne's translation: " A few months after Metella's death, he presented the people with a show of gladiators; and as, at that time, men and women had no separate places, but sat promiscuously in the theater, a woman of great beauty, and of one of the best families, happened to sit near Sylla. She was the daughter of Messala, and sister to the orator Hortensius; her name was Valeria ; and she had lately been divorced from her husband. This woman, coming behind Sylla, touched him, and took off a little of the nap of his robe, and then returned to her place. Sylla looked at her, quite amazed at her familiarity, when she said, ' Wonder not, my lord, at what I have done; I had only a mind to share a little in your good fortune.' Sylla was far from being displeased; on the contrary, it appeared that he was flattered very agreeably, for he sent to ask her name, and to inquire into her family and character. Then followed an interchange of amorous regards and smiles, which ended in a contract and marriage. The lady, perhaps, was not to blame. But Sylla, though he got a woman of reputation, and great accomplishments, yet came into the match upon wrong principles. Like a youth, he was caught with soft looks and languishing airs, things that are wont to excite the lowest of the passions." Others have thought that Sallust refers to Sylla's conduct on the death of his wife Metella, above mentioned, to whom, as she happened to fall sick when he was giving an entertainment to the people, and as the priest forbade him to have his house defiled with death on the occasion, he unfeelingly sent a bill of divorce, ordering her to be carried out of the house while the breath was in her. Cortius, Kritz, and Langius, think that the allusion is to Sylla's general faithlessness to his wives, for he had several; as if Sallust had used the singular for the plural, <foreign lang="la">uxore</foreign> for <foreign lang="la">uxoribus,</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">re uxori&acirc;;</foreign> but if Sallust meant to allude to more than one wife, why should he have restricted himiself to the singular?</note> He was eloquent <pb n="182"/>and subtle, and lived on the easiest terms with his friends.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Lived on the easiest terms with his friends] <quote lang="la">Facilis amiciti&acirc;.</quote> The critics are in doubt about the sense of this phrase. I have given that which Dietsch prefers, who says that a man <foreign lang="la">facilis amiciti&acirc;</foreign> is "one who easily grants his friends all that they desire, exacts little from them, and is no severe censor of their morals." Cortius explains it <foreign lang="la">facilis ad amicitiam,</foreign> and Facciolati, in his Lexicon, <foreign lang="la">facil&egrave; sibi amicos parans,</foreign> but these interpretations, as Kritzius observes, are hardly suitable to the ablative case.</note> His depth of thought in disguising his intentions, was incredible; he was liberal of most things, but especially of money.

<p> When Sylla came with his cavalry into Africa, as has just been stated, and arrived at the camp of Marius, though he had hitherto been unskilled and undisciplined in <pb n="183"/>the art of war, he became, in a short time, the most expert of the whole army. He was besides affable to the soldiers; he conferred favors on many at their request, and on others of his own accord, and was reluctant to receive any in return. But he repaid other obligations more readily than those of a pecuniary nature; he himself demanded repayment from no one; but rather made it his object that as many as possible should be indebted to him. He conversed, jocosely as well as seriously, with the humblest of the soldiers; he was their frequent companion at their works, on the march, and on guard. Nor did he ever, as is usual with depraved ambition, attempt to injure the character of the consul, or of any deserving person. His sole aim, whether in the council or the field, was to suffer none to excel him; to most he was superior. By such conduct he soon became a favorite both with Marius and with the army.</p></div1>

<p> Jugurtha, after he had lost the city of Capsa, and other strong and important places, as well as a vast sum of money, dispatched messengers to Bocchus, requesting him to bring his forces into Numidia as soon as possible, and stating that the time for giving battle was at hand. But finding that he hesitated, and was balancing the inducements to peace and war, he again corrupted his confidants, as on a previous occasion, with presents, and promised the Moor himself a third part of Numidia, should either the Romans be driven from Africa, or the war brought to an end without any diminution of his own territories. Being allured by this offer, Bocchus joined Jugurtha with a large force.</p>

But the whole conflict was more like a rencounter with robbers than a battle; the horse and foot of the enemy, mingled together without standards or order, wounded some of our men, and cut down others, and surprised many in the rear while fighting stoutly with those in front; neither valor nor arms were a sufficient defense, the enemy being superior in numbers, and covering the field on all sides.

<p> Marius, in this desperate emergency, was not more alarmed or disheartened than on any previous occasion, but rode about with his troop of cavalry, which he had formed of his bravest soldiers rather than his nearest friends, in every quarter of the field, sometimes supporting his own men when giving way, sometimes charging the enemy where they were thickest, and doing service to his troops with his sword, since, in the general confusion, he was unable to command with his voice.</p>
<p>The day had now closed, yet the barbarians abated nothing of their impetuosity, but, expecting that the night would be <pb n="185"/>in their favor, pressed forward, as their kings had directed them, with increased violence. Marius, in consequence, resolved upon a measure suited to his circumstances, and, that his men might have a place of retreat, took possession of two hills contiguous to each other, on one of which, too small for a camp, there was an abundant spring of water, while the other, being mostly elevated and steep, and requiring little fortification, was suited for his purpose as a place of encampment. He then ordered Sylla, with a body of cavalry, to take his station for the night on the eminence containing the spring, while he himself collected his scattered troops by degrees, the enemy being not less disordered,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">XCVIII.

Thus the kings, obliged by the strength of the Roman position, were deterred from continuing the combat; yet they did not allow their men to withdraw to a distance, but, surrounding both hills with a large force, encamped without any regular order. Having then lighted numerous fires, the barbarians, after their custom, spent most of the night in merriment, exultation, and tumultuous clamor, the kings, elated at having kept their ground, conducting themselves as conquerors. This scene, plainly visible to the Romans, under cover of the night and on the higher ground, afforded great encouragement to them.</p></div1>

The deserters, whose lives were of little value, and who were well acquainted with the country, observed the route of the enemy. Marius himself, too, as if no other were placed in charge, attended to every thing, went through the whole of the troops, and praised or blamed them according to their desert. He was always armed and on the alert, and obliged his men to imitate his example. He fortified his camp with the same caution with which he marched; stationing cohorts of the legions to watch the gates, and the auxiliary cavalry in front, and others upon the rampart <pb n="187"/>and lines. He went round the posts in person, not from suspicion that his orders would not be observed, but that the labor of the soldiers, shared equally by their general, might be endured by them with cheerfulness.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Might be endured by them with cheerfulness] <quote lang="la">Volentibus esset.</quote> A Greek phrase, <foreign lang="greek">boulome/nois ei)/h.</foreign></note> Indeed, Marius, as well at this as at other periods of the war, kept his men to their duty rather by the dread of shame<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Dread of shame] <quote lang="la">Pudore.</quote> Inducing each to have a regard to his character.</note> than of severity; a course which many said was adopted from desire of popularity, but some thought it was because he took pleasure in toils to which he had been accustomed from his youth, and in exertions which other men call perfect miseries.

<p> At length, on the fourth day of his march, when he was not far from the town of Cirta, his scouts suddenly made their appearance from all quarters at once; a circumstance by which the enemy was known to be at hand. But as they came in from different points, and all gave the same account, the consul, doubting in what form to draw up his army, made no alteration in it, but halted where he was, being already prepared for every contingency. Jugurtha's expectations, in consequence, disappointed him; for he had divided his force into four bodies, trusting that one of them, assuredly,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CI.

<p>While the cavalry was thus engaged, Bocchus, with his infantry, which his son Volux had brought up, and which, from delay on their march, had not been present in the former battle, assailed the Romans in the rear. Marius was at that moment <pb n="188"/>occupied in front, as Jugurtha was there with his largest force, The Numidian king, hearing of the arrival of Bocchus, wheeled secretly about, with a few of his followers, to the infantry,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Wheeled secretly about--to the infantry] <quote lang="la">Clam--ad pedites convortit.</quote> What infantry are meant, the commentators can not agree, nor is there any thing in the narrative on which a satisfactory decision can be founded. As the arrival of Bocchus is mentioned immediately before, Cortius supposes that the infantry of Bocchus are signified; and it may be so; but to whatever party the words were addressed, they were intended to be heard by the Romans, or for what purpose were they spoken in Latin ? Jugurtha may have spoken the words in both languages, and this, from what follows would appear to have been the case, for both sides understood him. <foreign lang="la">Quod ubi milites</foreign> (evidently the Roman soldiers) <foreign lang="la">accepere--simul barbari animos tollere,</foreign> etc. The <foreign lang="la">clam</foreign> signifies that Jugurtha turned about, or wheeled off, so as to escape the notice of Marius, with whom he had been contending.</note> and exclaimed in Latin, which he had learned to speak at Numantia, "that our men were struggling in vain; for that he had just slain Marius with his own hand;" showing, at the same time, his sword besmeared with blood, which he had, indeed, sufficiently stained by vigorously cutting down our infantry.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">By vigorously cutting down our infantry] <quote lang="la">Satis impigr&egrave; occiso pedite nostro.</quote> <cit><quote lang="fr">"A ces mots il leur montra son &eacute;p&eacute;c teinte du sang des n&ocirc;tres, dent il venait, en effet, de faire une assez cruelle boucherie."</quote><bibl>De Brosses.</bibl></cit> Of the other French translators, Beauz&eacute;e and Le Brun render the passage in a similar way; Dotteville and Dureau Delamalle, as well as all our English translators, take <foreign lang="la">pedite</foreign> as signifying only one soldier. Sir Henry Steuart even specifies that it was "a legionary soldier." The commentators, I should suppose, have all regarded the word as having a plural signification none of them, except Burnouf, who expresses a needless doubt, say any thing on the point.</note> When the soldiers heard this, they felt a shock, though rather at the horror of such an event, than from belief in him who asserted it; the barbarians, on the other hand, assumed fresh courage, and advanced with greater fury on the disheartened Romans, who were just on the point of taking to flight, when Sylla, having routed those to whom he had been opposed, fell upon the Moors in the flank. Bocchus instantly fled. Jugurtha, anxious to support his men, and to secure a victory so nearly won, was surrounded by our cavalry, and all his attendants, right and left, being slain, had to force a way alone, with great difficulty, through the weapons of the enemy. Marius, at the same time, having put to flight the cavalry, came up to support such of his men as he had understood to be giving ground. At last the enemy were defeated in every quarter. The spectacle on the open plains was then frightful;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">The spectacle on the open plains was then frightful, etc.] <quote lang="la">Tum spectaculum horribile campis patentibus,</quote> etc. The idea of this passage was probably taken, as Ciacconius intimates, from a description in Xenophon, Agesil. ii. 12, 14, part of which is quoted by Longinus, Sect. 19, as an example of the effect produced by the omission of conjunctions: <foreign lang="greek">*kai\ sumbalo/ntes ta\s a)spi/das e)wqou=nto, e)ma/xonto, a)pe/kteinon, a)pe/qnhskon. . . . )*epei/ ge mh\n e)/lhcen h( ma/xh, parh=n dh\ qea/sasqai e)/nqa sune/peson a)llh/lois, th\n me\n gh=n a(i/mati pefurme/nhn, nekrou\s de\ keime/nous fili/ous kai\ polemi/ous met' a)llh/lwn, a)spi/daz de\ diateqrumme/nas, do/rata sunteqrausme/na, e)gxeiri/dia gumna\ koulew=n ta\ me\n xamai\, ta\ d' e)n sw/masi, ta\ d' e)/ti meta\ xei=ras.</foreign> "Closing their shields together, they pushed, they fought, they slew, they were slain. . . . . .

Tacitus, Agric. c. 37, has copied this description of Sallust, as all the commentators have remarked: <foreign lang="la">Tum vero patentibus locis grande et atrox spectaculum.</foreign> <foreign lang="la">Sequi, vulnerare, capere, atque eosdem, oblatis aliis, trucidare. . . . . .

<p> At length the consul, now indisputably victor, arrived at the town of Cirta, whither he had at first intended to go. To this place, on the fifth day after the second defeat of the barbarians, came messengers from Bocchus, who, in the king's name, requested of Marius to send him two persons in whom he had full confidence, as he wished to confer with them on matters concerning both the interest of the Roman people and his own. Marius immediately dispatched Sylla and Aulus Manlius; who, though they went at the king's invitation, thought proper, notwithstanding, to address him first, in the hope of altering his sentiments, if he were unfavorable to peace, or of strengthening his inclination, if he were disposed to it. Sylla, therefore, to whose superiority, not in years but in eloquence, Manlius yielded precedence, spoke to Bocchus briefly as follows:</p>
<p>"It gives us great pleasure, King Bocchus, that the gods have at length induced a man, so eminent as yourself, to prefer peace to war, and no longer to stain your own excellent character <pb n="190"/>by an alliance with Jugurtha, the most infamous of mankind; and to relieve us, at the same time, from the disagreeable necessity of visiting with the same punishment your errors and his crimes. Besides, the Roman people, even from the very infancy<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CII. Besides, the Roman people, even from the very infancy, etc.] The reading of this passage, before the edition of Cortius, was this: <quote lang="la">Ad hoc, populo Romano jam a principio inopi melius visum amicos, qu&agrave;m servos, qu&oelig;rere.</quote> Gruter proposed to read <foreign lang="la">Ad hoc populo Romano inopi melius est visum,</foreign> etc., whence Cortius made <foreign lang="la">Ad hoc, populo Romano jam inopi visum,</foreign> etc. But the Bipont editors, observing that <foreign lang="la">inopi</foreign> was not quite consistent with <foreign lang="la">qu&oelig;rere servos,</foreign> altered the passage to <foreign lang="la">Ad hoc, populo Romano jam &agrave; principio reipublic&oelig; melius visum,</foreign> etc., which seems to be the best emendation that has been proposed, and which I have accordingly followed. Kritzius and Dietsch adopt it, except that they omit <foreign lang="la">reipublic&oelig;,</foreign> and put nothing in the place of <foreign lang="la">inopi.</foreign> Gerlach retains <foreign lang="la">inopi,</foreign> on the principle of <foreign lang="la">"quo insolentius, eo verius,"</foreign> and it may, after all, be genuine. Cortius omitted <foreign lang="la">melius</foreign> on no authority but his own.</note> of their state, have thought it better to seek friends than slaves, thinking it safer to rule over willing than forced subjects. But to you no friendship can be more suitable than ours; for, in the first place, we are at a distance from you, on which account there will be the less chance of misunderstanding between us, while our good feeling for you will be as strong as if we were near; and, secondly, because, though we have subjects in abundance, yet neither we, nor any other nation, can ever have a sufficiency of friends. Would that such had been your inclination from the first; for then you would assuredly, before this time, have received from the Roman people more benefits than you have now suffered evils. But since Fortune has the chief control in human affairs, and it has pleased her that you should experience our force as well as our favor, now, when she gives you this fair opportunity, embrace it without delay, and complete the course which you have begun. You have many and excellent means of atoning, with great ease, for past errors by future services. Impress this, however, deeply on your mind, that the Roman people are never outdone in acts of kindness; of their power in war you have already sufficient knowledge."</p>
<p>To this address Bocchus made a temperate and courteous reply, offering a few observations, at the same time, in extenuation of his error; and saying " that he had taken arms, not with any hostile feeling, but to defend his own dominions, as part of Numidia, out of which he had forcibly driven Jugurtha,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Out of which he had forcibly driven Jugurtha] <quote lang="la">Unde vi Jugurtham expulerit</quote> [<foreign lang="la">expulerat</foreign>].

Kritzius himself, accordingly, adopts <foreign lang="la">expulerit,</foreign> and supposes that Bocchus invents a falsehood, in the belief that the Romans would have no means of detecting it. But Bocchus may have spoken truth, referring, as M&uuml;ller suggests, to some previous transactions between him and Jugurtha, to which Sallust does not elsewhere allude.</note> was <pb n="191"/>his by right of conquest, and he could not allow it to be laid waste by Marius; that when he formerly sent embassadors to the Romans, he was refused their friendship; but that he would say nothing more of the past, and would, if Marius gave him permission, send another embassy to the senate." But no sooner was this permission granted, than the purpose of the barbarian was altered by some of his friends, whom Jugurtha, hearing of the mission of Sylla and Manlius, and fearful of what was intended by it, had corrupted with bribes.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="103">
<p> Marius, in the mean time, having settled his army in winter quarters, set out, with the light-armed cohorts and part of the cavalry, into a desert part of the country, to besiege a fortress of Jugurtha's, in which he had placed a garrison consisting wholly of Roman deserters. And now again Bocchus, either from reflecting on what he had suffered in the two engagements, or from being admonished by such of his friends as Jugurtha had not corrupted, selected, out of the whole number of his adherents, five persons of approved integrity and eminent abilities, whom he directed to go, in the first place, to Marius, and afterward to proceed, if Marius gave his consent, as embassadors to Rome, granting them full powers to treat concerning his affairs, and to conclude the war upon any terms whatsoever. These five immediately set out for the Roman winter-quarters, but being beset and spoiled by Getulian robbers on the way, fled, in alarm and ill plight,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CIII. In ill plight] <quote lang="la">Sine decore.</quote></note> to Sylla, whom the consul, when he went on his expedition, had left as pro-pr&aelig;tor with the army. Sylla received them, not, as they had deserved, like faithless enemies, but with the greatest ceremony and munificence; from which the barbarians concluded that what was said of Roman avarice was false, and that Sylla, from his generosity, must be their friend. For interested bounty,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Interested bounty] <quote lang="la">Largitio.</quote> <cit><quote>"The word signifies liberal treatment of others vith a view to our own interest; without any real goodwill."</quote><bibl>M&uuml;ller.</bibl></cit> <cit><quote>"He intends a severe stricture on his own age, and the manners of the Romans."</quote><bibl>Dietsch.</bibl></cit></note> in <pb n="192"/>those days, was still unknown to many; by whom every man who was liberal was also thought benevolent, and all presents were considered to proceed from kindness.

Sylla promised them all that they requested; and, being instructed how to address Marius and the senate, they tarried in the camp about forty days.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">About forty days] Waiting, apparently, for the return of Marius.</note></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="104">
<p> When Marius, having failed in the object<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CIV. Having failed in the object, etc.] <quote lang="la">Infecto, quo intenderat, negotio.</quote> Though this is the reading of most of the manuscripts, Kritzius, M&uuml;ller, and Dietsch, read <foreign lang="la">confecto,</foreign> as if Marius could not have failed in his attempt.</note> of his expedition, returned to Cirta, and was informed of the arrival of the embassadors, he desired both them and Sylla to come to him, together with Lucius Bellienus, the pr&aelig;tor from Utica, and all that were of senatorial rank in any part of the country, with whom he discussed the instructions of Bocchus to his embassadors; to whom permission to proceed to Rome was granted by the consul. In the mean time a truce was asked, a request to which assent was readily expressed by Sylla and the majority; the few, who advocated harsher measures, were men inexperienced in human affairs, which, unstable and fluctuating, are always verging to opposite extremes.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Are always verging to opposite extremes] <quote lang="la">Semper in advorsa mutant.</quote> Rose renders this " are always changing, and constantly for the worse;" and most other translators have given something similar. But this is absurd; for every one sees that all changes in human affairs are not for the worse. <foreign lang="la">Adversa</foreign> is evidently to be taken in the sense which I have given.</note></p>
<p>The Moors having obtained all that they desired, three of them started for Rome with Cneius Octavius Rufus, who, as qu&aelig;stor, had brought pay for the army to Africa; the other two returned to Bocchus, who heard from them, with great pleasure, their account both of other particulars, and especially of the courtesy and attention of Sylla.</p>
<p>To his three embassadors that went to Rome, when, after a deprecatory acknowledgment that their king had been in error, and had been led astray by the treachery of Jugurtha, they solicited for him friendship and alliance, the following answer was given: "The senate and people of Rome are <pb n="193"/>wont to be mindful of both services and injuries; they pardon Bocchus, since he repents of his fault, and will grant him their alliance and friendship when he shall have deserved them."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="105">
<p> When this reply was communicated to Bocchus, he requested Marius, by letter, to send Sylla to him, that, at his discretion,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CV. At his discretion] <quote lang="la">Arbitratu.</quote> Kritzius observes that this word comprehends the notion of plenary powers to treat and decide: <foreign lang="de">der mit unbeschr&auml;nkter Vollmacht unterhandeln k&ouml;nnte</foreign></note> measures might be adopted for their common interest. Sylla was accordingly dispatched, attended with a guard of cavalry, infantry, and Balearic slingers, besides some archers and a Pelignian cohort, who, for the sake of expedition, were furnished with light arms, which, however, protected them, as efficiently as any others, against the light darts of the enemy. As he was on his march, on the fifth day after he set out, Volux, the son of Bocchus, suddenly appeared on the open plain with a body of cavalry, which amounted in reality to not more than a thousand, but which, as they approached in confusion and disorder, presented to Sylla and the rest the appearance of a greater number, and excited apprehensions of hostility. Every one, therefore, prepared himself for action, trying and presenting<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Presenting] <quote lang="la">Intendere.</quote> The critics are in doubt to what to refer this word; some have thought of understanding <foreign lang="la">animum;</foreign> Cortius, Wasse, and M&uuml;ller, think it is meant only of the bows of the archers; Kritzius, Burnouf, and Allen, refer it, apparently with better judgment, to the <foreign lang="la">arma</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">tela</foreign> in general.</note> his arms and weapons; some fear was felt among them, but greater hope, as they were now conquerors, and were only meeting those whom they had often overcome. After a while, however, a party of horse sent forward to reconnoiter, reported, as was the case, that nothing but peace was intended.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="106">
<p> Volux, coming forward, addressed himself to Sylla, saying that he was sent by Bocchus his father to meet and escort him. The two parties accordingly formed a junction, and prosecuted their journey, on that day and the following, without any alarm. But when they had pitched their camp, and evening had set in, Volux came running, with looks of perplexity, to Sylla, and said that he had learned from his scouts that Jugurtha was at hand, entreating and urging him, at the same time, to escape with him privately in the night. Sylla boldly replied, " that he had no fear of Jugurtha, an <pb n="194"/>enemy so often defeated; that he had the utmost confidence in the valor of his troops; and that, even if certain destruction were at hand, he would rather keep his ground, than save, by deserting his followers, a life at best uncertain, and perhaps soon to be lost by disease." Being pressed, however, by Volux, to set forward in the night, he approved of the suggestion, and immediately ordered his men to dispatch their supper,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CVI. To dispatch their supper] <quote lang="la">C&oelig;natos esse.</quote> <cit><quote>"The perfect is not without its force; it signifies that Sylla wished his orders to be performed with the greatest expedition."</quote><bibl>Kritzius.</bibl></cit> He orders them to have done supper.</note> to light as many fires as possible in the camp, and to set out in silence at the first watch.</p>
<p>When they were all fatigued with their march during the night, and Sylla was preparing, at sunrise, to pitch his camp, the Moorish cavalry announced that Jugurtha was encamped about two miles in advance. At this report, great dismay fell upon our men; for they believed themselves betrayed by Volux, and led into an ambuscade. Some exclaimed that they ought to take vengeance on him at once, and not suffer such perfidy to remain unpunished.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="107">
<p> But Sylla, though he had similar thoughts, protected the Moor from violence; exhorting his soldiers to keep up their spirits; and saying, "that a handful of brave men had often fought successfully against a multitude; that the less anxious they were to save their lives in battle, the greater would be their security; and that no man, who had arms in his hands, ought to trust for safety to his unarmed heels, or to turn to the enemy, in however great danger, the defenseless and blind parts of his body."<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CVII. And blind parts of his body] <quote lang="la">C&oelig;cum corpus.</quote> Imitated from Xenophon, Cyrop. iii. 3, 45: <foreign lang="greek">*mwro\n ga\r to\ kratei=n boulome/nous, ta\ tufla\, tou) sw/matos, kai\ a)/opla, kai\ a)/xeira, tau=ta e)nanti/a ta/ttein toi=s poleui/ois feu/gontas.</foreign> "It is folly for those that desire to conquer, to turn the blind, unarmed, and handless parts of the body, to the enemy in flight."</note> Having then called almighty Jupiter to witness the guilt and perfidy of Bocchus, he ordered Volux, as being an instrument of his father's hostility,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">As being an instrument of his father's hostility] <quote lang="la">Quoniam hostilia faceret.</quote> <cit><quote>"Since he wished to deceive the Romans by pretended friendship."</quote><bibl>M&uuml;ller</bibl></cit></note> to quit the camp.</p>
<p>Volux, with tears in his eyes, entreated him to entertain no such suspicions; declaring " that nothing in the affair had been caused by treachery on his part, but all by the subtilty <pb n="195"/>of Jugurtha, to whom his line of march had become known through his scouts. But as Jugurtha had no great force with him, and as his hopes and resources were dependent on his father Bocchus, he assuredly would not attempt any open violence, when the son of Bocchus would himself be a witness of it. He thought it best for Sylla, therefore, to march boldly through the middle of his camp, and that as for himself, he would either send forward his Moors, or leave them where they were, and accompany Sylla alone." This course, under such circumstances, was adopted; they set forward without delay, and, as they came upon Jugurtha unexpectedly, while he was in doubt and hesitation how to act, they passed without molestation. In a few days afterward, they arrived at the place to which their march was directed.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="108">
<p> There was, at this time, in constant and familiar intercourse with Bocchus, a Numidian named Aspar, who had been sent to him by Jugurtha, when he heard of Sylla's intended interview, in the character of embassador, but secretly to be a spy on the Mauretanian king's proceedings. There was also with him a certain Dabar, son of Massugrada, one of the family of Masinissa,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CVIII. Of the family of Masinissa] <quote lang="la">Ex gente Masiniss&oelig;.</quote> Massugrada was the son of Masinissa by a concubine.</note> but of inferior birth on the maternal side, as his father was the son of a concubine.

Glareanus, Badius Ascensius, the Bipont editors, and Burnouf, with most of the translators, omit <foreign lang="la">Romanis,</foreign> and I have thought proper to imitate their example.</note> on many former occasions, sent him forthwith to Sylla, to say "that he was ready to do whatever the Romans desired; that Sylla himself should appoint the place, day, and hour,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Place, day, and hour] <quote lang="la">Diem, locum, tempus.</quote> Not only the day, but the time of the day.</note> for a conference; that he kept all points, which he had settled with him before, inviolate ;<note anchored="yes" place="foot">That he kept all points, which he had settled with him before, inviolate] <quote lang="la">Consulta sese omnia cum illo integra habere.</quote> Kritzius justly observes that most editors, in interpreting this passage, have erroneously given to <foreign lang="la">consulta</foreign> the sense of <foreign lang="la">consulenda;</foreign> and that the sense is, "that all that he had arranged with Sylla before, remained unaltered, and that he was not drawn from his resolutions by the influence of Jugurtha."</note> and that he was not to fear the presence of <pb n="196"/>Jugurtha's embassador as any restraint<note anchored="yes" place="foot">And that he was not to fear the presence of Jugurtha's embassador as any restraint, etc.] <quote lang="la">Neu Jugurth&oelig; legatum pertimesceret, quo res communis licentius gereretur.</quote> There is some difficulty in this passage. Burnouf makes the nearest approach to a satisfactory explanation of it. " Sylla," says he, " was not to fear the envoy of Jugurtha, <foreign lang="la">quo,</foreign> on which account (equivalent to <foreign lang="la">eoque,</foreign> and on that account, i.e. on account of his freedom from apprehension) their common interests would be more freely arranged." Yet it appears from what follows that fear of Jugurtha's envoy could not be dismissed, and that there could be no freedom of discussion in his presence, as Sylla was to say but little before him, and to speak more at large at a private meeting. These considerations have induced Kritzius to suppose that the word <foreign lang="la">remoto,</foreign> or something similar, has been lost after <foreign lang="la">quo.</foreign> The Bipont editors inserted <foreign lang="la">cautum esse</foreign> before <foreign lang="la">quo,</foreign> which is without authority, and does not at all assist the sense.</note> on the discussion of their common interests, since, without admitting him, he could have no security against Jugurtha's treachery." I find, however, that it was rather from African duplicity<note anchored="yes" place="foot">African duplicity] <quote lang="la">Punic&acirc; fide.</quote> <cit><quote><foreign lang="la">"Punica fides</foreign> was a well-known proverbial expression for treachery and deceit.

<div1 type="chapter" n="109">
<p> Sylla replied, "that he should speak on but few particulars before Aspar, and discuss others at a private meeting, or in the presence of only a few;" dictating, at the same time, what answer should be returned by Bocchus.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CIX. What answer should be returned by Bocchus] That is, in the presence of Aspar.</note> Afterward, when they met, as Bocchus had desired, Sylla stated, "that he had come, by order of the consul, to inquire whether he would resolve on peace or on war." Bocchus, as he had been previously instructed by Sylla, requested him to come again at the end of ten days, since he had as yet formed no determination, but would at that time give a decisive answer. Both then retired to their respective camps.<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Both then retired to their respective eamps] <quote lang="la">Deinde ambo in sua castra digress.</quote> Both, i.e. Bocchus and Sylla, not Aspar and Sylla, as Cortius. imagines.</note> But when the night was far advanced, Sylla was secretly sent for by Bocchus.

The king at once commenced thus:</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="110">
<p> " I never expected that I, the greatest monarch in this part of the world, and the richest of all whom I know, should ever owe a favor to a private man. Indeed, Sylla, before I knew you, I gave assistance to many who solicited me, and to others without solicitation, and stood in need of no man's assistance.

Of the sincerity of this assertion you may at once make trial; take my arms, my soldiers, my money, or whatever you please, and use it as your own. But do not suppose, as long as you live, that your kindness to me has been fully requited; my sense of it will always remain undiminished, and you shall, with my knowledge, wish for nothing in vain. For, as I am of opinion, it is less dishonorable to a prince to be conquered in battle than to be surpassed in generosity.</p>
<p>" With respect to your republic, whose interests you are sent to guard, hear briefly what I have to say. I have neither made war upon the Roman people, nor desired that it should be made; I have merely defended my territories with arms against an armed force. But from hostilities, since such is your pleasure, I now desist. Prosecute the war with Jugurtha as you think proper. The river Mulucha, which was the boundary between Miscipsa and me, I shall neither pass myself, nor suffer Jugurtha to come within it.

<div1 type="chapter" n="111">
<p> To this speech Sylla replied, as far as concerned himself, briefly and modestly; but spoke, with regard to the peace and their common concerns, much more at length. He signified to the king " that the senate and people of Rome, as they <pb n="198"/>had the superiority in the field, would think themselves little obliged by what he promised; that he must do something which would seem more for their interest than his own; and that for this there was now a fair opportunity, since he had Jugurtha in his power, for, if he delivered him to the Romans, they would feel greatly indebted to him, and their friendship and alliance, as well as that part of Numidia which he claimed,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CXI.

They then concerted measures for conducting a pretended treaty of peace, of which Jugurtha, weary of war, was extremely desirous. Having settled their plans, they separated.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="112">
<p> On the next day Bocchus sent for Aspar, Jugurtha's envoy, and acquainted him that he had ascertained from Sylla, through Dabar, that the war might be concluded on certain conditions; and that he should therefore make inquiry as to the sentiments of his king. Aspar proceeded with joy to Jugurtha's camp, and having received full instructions from him, returned in haste to Bocchus at the end of eight days, with intelligence "that Jugurtha was eager to do whatever might be required, but that he put little confidence in Marius, as treaties of peace, concluded with Roman generals, had often before proved of no effect; that if Bocchus, however, wished to consult the interests of both,<note anchored="yes" place="foot">CXII.

<div1 type="chapter" n="113">
<p> The Moor, after long meditation on these suggestions, at length expressed his assent to them, but whether in pretense or sincerity I have not been able to discover. But the inclinations of kings, as they are violent, are often fickle, and at variance with themselves. At last, after a time and place were fixed for coming to a conference about the treaty, Bocchus addresssed himself at one time to Sylla and at another to the envoy of Jugurtha, treating them with equal affability, and making the same professions to both. Both were in consequence equally delighted, and animated with the fairest expectations. But on the night preceding the day appointed for the conference; the Moor, after first assembling his friends, and then, on a change of mind, dismissing them, is reported to have had many anxious struggles with himself, disturbed alike in his thoughts and his gestures, which, even when he was silent, betrayed the secret agitation of his mind. At last, however, he ordered that Sylla should be sent for, and, according to his desire, laid an ambush for Jugurtha.</p>
<p>As soon as it was day, and intelligence was brought that Jugurtha was at hand, Bocchus, as if to meet him and do him honor, went forth, attended by a few friends, and our qu&aelig;stor, as far as a little hill, which was full in the view of the men who were placed in ambush. To the same spot came Jugurtha with most of his adherents, unarmed, according to agreement; when immediately, on a signal being given, he was assailed on all sides by those who were lying in wait. The others were cut to pieces, and Jugurtha himself was delivered bound to Sylla, and by him conducted to Marius.</p></div1>
