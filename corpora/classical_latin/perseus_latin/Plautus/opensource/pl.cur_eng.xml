<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;DROMUS</speaker><p> is desperately in love with Planesium, who is in the possession of Cappadox, an avaricious Procurer. Not having the means of obtaining her freedom, Ph&aelig;dromus sends Curculio, his Parasite, to <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, to borrow the money from a friend. The friend being unable to lend it, Curculio by accident meets a military officer, named Therapontigonus, and is invited by him to dinner. The Captain accidentally mentions to him that he has agreed to purchase Planesium of the Procurer, and that the money is deposited with Lyco, the banker, who, has been ordered, on receiving a letter signed with the Captain's signet, to have the young woman delivered to the bearer. While the Captain is overpowered with wine, Curculio steals his signet, and hastens back to <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>, where he forges a letter by means of it, which he delivers to Lyco, as though from the Captain. The money is paid to the Procurer, and Planesium is handed over to Curculio; a condition having been previously made, that if she should turn out to be a free woman by birth, the money shall be repaid to the purchaser. Curculio then delivers Planesium to Ph&aelig;dromus. The same day, the Captain arrives at <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName>, and is soon after recognized by Planesium as her brother, through the medium of the ring, which had belonged to her father. To corroborate her assertion, Planesium produces another ring, which Therapontigonus had presented to her when a child as a birthday present. On this, she is given by her brother in marriage to Ph&aelig;dromus; and Cappadox, much against his will, is forced to refund the money to the Captain.

<stage>(Before daybreak.)  Enter at one side of the stage PH&AElig;DROMUS, with a lighted torch, and followed by SLAVES with wine and provisions for an entertainment, and PALINURUS on the opposite side.</stage>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Whither away must I say that you are going out of doors at this time o' night, Ph&aelig;dromus, with that dress and with this train<milestone n="2" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">And with this train</lemma>:  As it is supposed to be before daybreak, he is holding a lighted torch, and is attended by a train of slaves, who are carrying wine and other provisions for the entertainment, or early breakfast, which he is about to give. He has also a gay dress on for the occasion.</note>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Whither Venus and Cupid summon me, and Love persuades me; whether 'tis the midnight or whether the earliest twilight, if the day is fixed<milestone n="5" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">If the day is fixed</lemma>:  "Status condictus dies." This term properly applies to a day appointed for pleading a cause.</note> for pleading your cause with your antagonist, still must you go where they command you, whether you will or no.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> But pray, pray---- </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p>Pray ---- you are annoying to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Really that is neither pretty nor befitting you to say. You are your own servant<milestone n="9" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your own servant</lemma>:  "Puer" may signify either "servant" or "boy" in this passage. In the former case, Palinurus would mean, "you are acting as your own servant, in carrying the torch;" in the latter, the allusion would probably be to the fact that boys, handsomely drest, used, at the nuptial ceremony, to carry lighted torches before the bride and bridegroom.</note>; in your fine garb you are showing the light with your waxen torch<milestone n="10" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your waxen torch</lemma>:  It is not improbable that the flambeaux, or torches, used by the higher classes, were of wax; while those in more common use were made of pine-wood, tow, and other inflammable substances.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> And ought I not to carry that which is gathered by the labour of the little bees--which has its birth in sweets--to my own sweet one, my little honey?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> But whither must I say that you are going?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> If you ask me that, I'll tell, so that you may know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> If I make the enquiry, what would you answer me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> This is the Temple <stage>pointing to it</stage> of &AElig;sculapius.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> That I have known for more than a twelvemonth past.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Close to it is that door, dear as my very eyes. <stage>Points to the door of CAPPADOX.</stage> Hail to you! door, dear as my very eyes; have you been quite well of late?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Did a fever leave you<milestone n="18" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A fever leave you</lemma>:  He asks his master this, as he is in doubt whether he is in his senses or not. It was a notion among the ancients that fasting was very apt to produce delirium.</note> but yesterday, or the day before, and did you take your dinner yesterday?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Are you laughing at me? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Why then, madman, are you enquiring whether the door is well or not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> I' faith, I've known it as a door most comely and most discreet: never one word does it whisper; when it is opened, it is silent; and when, by night, she secretly comes out to me, it holds its peace.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> And are you not, Ph&aelig;dromus, doing, or contemplating the doing of, some deed which is unworthy of yourself or of your family? Are you not laying a snare for some modest fair one, or for one that should be modest?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> For no one; and may <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> not permit me to do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> I wish the same. Ever, if you are wise, so bestow your love, that if the public should know the object which you love, it may be no disgrace to you. Ever do you take care that you be not disgraced<milestone n="30" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Be not disgraced</lemma>:  "Intestabilis." One who is, infamous, and whose evidence cannot be taken as a witness in the courts of law. Lambinus suggests that here, as in other instances where the word is used by Plautus, an indelicate pun is intended.</note>.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> What means that expression? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> For you to proceed with caution on your path; the object that you love, love in the presence of witnesses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Why, 'tis a Procurer that lives here. <stage>He points.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> No one drives you away from there, nor yet forbids you, if you have the money, to buy what's openly on sale. No one forbids any person from going along the public road, so long as he doesn't make a path through the field that's fenced around; so long as you keep yourself away from the wife, the widow, the maiden, youthful age, and free-born children, love what you please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> This is the house of a Procurer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> A curse befall it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p>Why so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Because it serves in an infamous service.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You speak out. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Be it so, most especially.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Once more, will you hold your tongue?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> You bade me speak out<milestone n="42" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Bade me speak out</lemma>:  Ph&aelig;dromus had said to Palinurus, "Obloquere," which may either mean "you are abusive" or "do you speak out." Ph&aelig;dromus intends it in the former sense, but Palinurus pretends to understand it in the latter; and when his master tells him to be quiet, he says, "Why, I thought you told me to speak out."</note>, I thought.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Then, now I forbid you. But, as I had begun to say, he has a young female slave----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> This Procurer, you mean, who's living here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You have hold of it exactly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> The less shall I be in dread of its falling.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You are impertinent. He wishes to make her a courtesan, while she is desperately in love with me; whereas I don't wish to have her upon loan.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Because I'm for having her as my own; I love her equally as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Clandestine courtship is bad; 'tis utter ruin.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> I' troth, 'tis so as you say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Has she as yet submitted to the yoke of Venus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> For me she is as chaste as though she were my own sister, unless, indeed, she is any the more unchaste for some kissing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Always, do you understand, flame follows very close on smoke; with smoke, nothing can be burnt, with flame, it can. He who wishes to eat the kernel<milestone n="55" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To eat the kernel</lemma>:  This is exactly our proverb, which implies that labour attends every pursuit--"To extract the kernel, you must crack the shell."</note> of the nut, first breaks the nut; he who wishes to seduce, opens the dance<milestone n="56" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Opens the dance</lemma>:  There is an indecent allusion intended in this line, which is somewhat modified in the translation.</note> with kisses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> But she is chaste, and never yet has bestowed her favours upon man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> That I could believe<milestone n="58" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I could believe</lemma>:  Palinurus thinks it impossible that such a wretch as Cappadox would leave her untouched.</note>, if any Procurer had any shame.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Well, but what think you of her? When she has any opportunity, she steals away to me; when she has given me a kiss, she's off again. This happens by reason of this, because this Procurer is lying a-bed ill in the Temple<milestone n="62" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In the Temple</lemma>:  It was the custom of those who wished to ask anything of the Gods, to lie in their Temples, in order that they might receive their answers and instructions in their sleep.</note> of &AElig;sculapius; that fellow is my torturer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> At one time he asks me for thirty min&aelig; for her, at another for a great talent; and from him I cannot obtain any fair and just dealing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> You are too exacting, in requiring that of him which no Procurer possesses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Now, I've sent my Parasite hence to <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName><milestone n="67" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName></lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> was in <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>. Schmieder justly observes, that the Parasite must have used the wings of D&aelig;dalus, to go from <placeName key="tgn,7011116">Epidaurus</placeName> in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, and discharge his commission and return in four days only. A Roman audience would not, however, be likely to know much about the relative distance of places so far off.</note>, to ask for money on loan from my friend; if he doesn't bring me this, which way to turn myself I know not.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> If you salute the Deities, towards the right<milestone n="70" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Towards the right</lemma>:  Dextrovorsum. A quibble seems to be intended in the use of this word; Palinurus, in saying "turn to the right hand," probably me&aelig;is, sarcastically, "turn to a right course of life."</note> I think; now this is this altar of Venus before their door.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> I have already vowed to bring me<milestone n="72" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To bring me</lemma>:  "Me inferre." These words may mean, according to the context, either "myself to bring" or "to bring myself." Ph&aelig;dromus means to use them in the former sense; but, in his quibbling mood, Palinurus chooses to understand them in the latter.</note> an early breakfast for my Venus<milestone n="72" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">For my Venus</lemma>:  By his "Venus" he means Planesium, with whom he is desperately in love, and for whom and the Procuress he is carrying the "jentaculum." This was a meal which, we learn from Martial, was generally taken about three or four o'clock in the morning. It was, however, taken by few but invalids and children. The reason of Ph&aelig;dromus providing a "jentaculum' for his mistress is probably the circumstance of the Procurer not being likely to interfere, as he has determined to pass the night in the Temple of &AElig;sculapius.</note>. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> What? Will you then be giving up yourself as a breakfast to Venus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Myself, and you, and all of these. <stage>Pointing to the SLAVES.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Then you would have Venus to be sick outright.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> <stage>to an ATTENDANT</stage>. Here, boy, give me the bowl.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> What are you going to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You'll know directly. An old hag is in the habit of sleeping here, as the keeper of the door; the name of the Procuress is "Much-bibber" and "Neat-bibber."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Just as you would speak of a flagon, in which Chian wine<milestone n="79" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Chian wine</lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, now <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Scio</placeName>, in the &AElig;gean Sea, produced the choicest wine, which was the only wine of Greece that did not requne to be mixed with sea-water, to correct acidity and increase its durability.</note> is wont to be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> What need is there of words? She is a most vinous soul; and the very moment that I've sprinkled this door with the wine, she knows by the smell that I'm here, and opens it forthwith.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Is it for her the bowl is brought with the wine?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Unless you object. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I do object; for I'd rather have it broken about him who has brought it. I fancied it was brought for ourselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Why don't you hold your tongue? If any's left after her, it will be enough for ourselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> What river is it, pray, that the sea does not receive?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Follow me this way, Palinurus, to the door; do you be obedient to me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> I'll do so. <stage>They advance to the door of the PROCURER'S house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> <stage>sprinkling the door with wine</stage>. Come, drink, you joyous door, quaff on, readily prove propitious unto me.
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Arouse and send out here to me your portress.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PROC.</speaker><p> The savour of aged wine has reached my nostrils; the love of it has brought me in my eagerness hither in the dark; wherever it is, it's near me. O capital, I've found it. <stage>Stooping, and smelling at the bowl.</stage> Hail to you, my soul, Joy of dear Bacchus; how enamoured am I of your old age.

<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> By my faith, he who is in love, if he is in want as well, is afflicted with a dreadful malady.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Such is not the case with me; for I feel sure that this very day my Parasite will come hither to me with the money. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> You attempt something mighty, if you expect that which nowhere exists.</p></sp>

<stage>Re-enter the PROCURESS, with PLANESIUM, from the house of CAPPADOX.</stage>

Come softly out, and prevent the noise of the doors and the creaking of the hinges, my dear Planesium, that our master mayn't perceive that that is going on which we are doing here.

<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> <stage>to PH&AElig;DROMUS</stage>. Do you see how the palsied hag is giving her dose? She herself has learnt right well to drink up the wine; to the door she's giving water for it to drink.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLANESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>looking around</stage>. Where are you--you who have summoned me on the recognizances of Venus<milestone n="162" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Recognizances of Venus</lemma>:  "Veneriis vadimoniis." She borrows a legal phrase here. "Vadimonium legere" was, "to call a person on his bail" or "recognizances." When the Pr&aelig;tor had granted an action, the plaintiff required the defendant to give security for his appearance on the day named. The defendant, on finding a surety, was said "vadem dare," or "vadimonium facere;" and the "vas," or "surety," was said "spondere." The plaintiff, if satisfied with the surety, was said "vadari reum," "to let the defendant go on his sureties." Planesium probably means that she considers herself summoned on pain of forfeiting the love of Ph&aelig;dromus.</note>? To you do I present myself, and, in the same way do I call on you, on the other hand, to present yourself to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Palinurus, Palinurus! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> Say on; why is it that you call upon Palinurus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. She is a charming one.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> You are not in your senses, master; a thing that's grievous to me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You are not sufficiently respectful to me: hold your tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> The person that sees<milestone n="170" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Person that sees</lemma>:  He is censuring his master for his backwardness in not embracing Planesium instantly on her appearance.</note> the object which he loves, and enjoys not the opportunity while he may, is one who torments his own self.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PLANESIUM</speaker><p> Clasp me, embrace me then. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> <stage>embracing her</stage>. This, too, is a reason for which I could wish to live; because your master restrains, you, in secret do I court you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLANESIUM</speaker><p> Restrain me? He neither can restrain me, nor will he restrain me, unless death should separate my soul from you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Let monarchs keep their kingdoms to themselves, the rich their riches to themselves, to themselves their honors, to themselves their prowess, to themselves their combats, to themselves their battles; so long as they abstain from envying me, let each one of them keep what is his own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Of a truth, I cannot refrain from giving a lecture to my master; for, really, it is good to love in a moderate degree; to distraction, it is not good; but to love to entire distraction, is the thing that my master's doing. <stage>Aloud.</stage> What say you, sir? Have you made a vow, Ph&aelig;dromus, you'd watch the night through for Venus? For really, upon my faith, before very long hence the dawn will be breaking.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. It's all over with him. I see that these two are equally in love to distraction; and both of them are mad.

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> What, you abusing my own Venus? And really, is a slave well trounced with the rod to be commencing a discussion with myself? But, by the powers, you've surely said that to your own misfortune. <stage>Strikes him.</stage> There, take that, by way of punishment for this abusive language, that you may be able to put a check upon your speech.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> What, do you still persist, whip- scoundrel? <stage>Strikes hint.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLANESIUM</speaker><p> Don't, there's a dear, be beating a stone, lest you should hurt your hand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALINURUS</speaker><p> You perpetrate, Ph&aelig;dromus, a flagitious and a shameful deed of great enormity; one who directs you aright, you pummel with your fists; her you are in love with, a mere nonentity.

<sp><speaker>PLANESIUM</speaker><p> Take care to remember it. Once more, before I go hence, take this kiss. <stage>Kisses him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> By heavens, really if a kingdom now were offered me, I should not obtain it with greater pleasure. When shall I see you again?</p></sp>

This word gives occasion to a pun here, as, according to the context, it may either meal "that I am arrived," or "wind." The Parasite says, "Give me reason (by providing some victuals) to rejoice that I have arrived." Ph&aelig;dromus chooses to understand him as saving, "Give me some wind, that I may rejoice," and says "By all means," and begins to fan him. The other asks what he is doing, or making; to which he replies, "Making some air."</note>. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You shall eat something just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> I' faith, I don't want "something;" I'd rather have what's fixed for certain, than your "something."
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Aye, but if you only knew what has been put by for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> I'd very much like to know where it is; for really it's necessary for it and my teeth to make acquaintance.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> A gammon of bacon, a sow's stomach, some udder and kernels of the throat.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> What, all this do you say? Perhaps you mean that they are in the flesh-market?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> In the dishes, I mean; they've been got ready for you, since we knew that you were about to arrive.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Take care you don't be fooling me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> So may the fair one love me whom I love, I don't say what's false. But as to what I sent you upon I'm none the wiser yet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> I've brought back nothing. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> You've undone me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> I can find something, if you'll give me your attention. After, at your request, I had set out, I arrived in Caria; I saw your friend; I asked him to make me a loan of some money. In answer, you were to know that he was willing to oblige you; he didn't wish to disappoint you, as it is only proper that a person who is a friend should be ready, and should assist his friend. In a few words he answered me, and quite in confidence, that he also was in the same extreme want of money as yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> By your words you ensure my undoing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Why no; I'm saving you, and wish you to be saved. After this answer was given me, I went away from him to the Forum, in sorrow that I had applied to him in vain. By accident I espied a military officer; this person I accosted, and as I approached I saluted him. "Save you," said he to me, took my right hand, drew me aside, and asked me why I had come to Caria. I said that I had come there for the sake of amusement. Upon this he asked me whether I knew a certain Lyco, a banker of Epidaurus. I said I knew him. "Well, and the Procurer Cappadox?" I answered yes, that I had seen him. "But what do you want of him?" said I. "Because," said he, "I bought of him a girl for thirty min&aelig;, her clothes and golden jewels too; and for these last ten min&aelig; more are added." "Have you paid the money?" said I. "No," said he; "it is lodged with this Lyco the banker, whom I was mentioning, and I've instructed him that the person who should bring a letter sealed with my own ring, to him he was to give his services, that he might receive the damsel, with her jewels of gold and her clothes, from the Procurer." After he told me this, I was going away from him. At once he called me back, invited me to dinner; it was a point of conscience, I was unwilling to refuse him. "What if we go off home, and take our places at table?" said he. The suggestion pleased me; it is neither proper to lengthen out the day, nor to curtail the night. Everything was prepared, and we, for whom it was prepared, were at our places. After we had dined and well drunk, he asked for the dice to be fetched him. He challenged me to play with him a game of hazard. I staked my cloak, he staked his ring against it; he called on the name<milestone n="356" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Called on the name</lemma>:  On the custom of invoking their mistresses, when playing at dice, see a Note to the Captivi, Act I., Sc. 1.

I took up the dice, and invoked Hercules as my genial patron<milestone n="358" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">My genial patron</lemma>:  "Nutricem;" literally, "nurse." It has been suggested that the Parasite intended to compliment his entertainer, the Captain, under the name of Hercules, whom he invokes for luck. The Delphin Commentator says that Parasites invoked Hercules because the tenths of entertainments were offered to him, and these were distributed among the needy, in the number of whom they ranked.</note>; I threw a first-rate cast<milestone n="259" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A first-rate cast</lemma>:  The best throw with the "tali" was called "Venus" or "Venereus jactus," when the dice turned up 2, 3, 4, and 5. As it war by this throw that the Romans chose the King of the Feast, it received the name of "Basilicus," "the king's throw." See the last Scene in the Asinaria.</note>, and pledged him in a bumping cup; in return he drank it off, reclined his head, and fell fast asleep. I slily took away from him the ring, and took my legs quietly from off the couch, so that the Captain mightn't perceive it. The servants enquired whither I was going; I said that I was going whither persons when full are wont to go. When I beheld the door, at once on the instant I betook myself away from the place.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> I commend you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Commend me when I've brought this thing about which you desire. Now let's go indoors, that we may seal the letter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> Do I delay you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> But let's cram down something first, the gammon, the udder, and the kernels; these are the foundations for the stomach, with bread and roast beef, a good-sized cup and a capacious pot, that counsel enough may be forthcoming. Do you, yourself, seal the letter; he'll do the honors <stage>pointing to PALINURUS</stage> while I am eating. I'll dictate after what fashion you're to write. Follow me this way, in-doors.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCO</speaker><p> I am. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Therapontigonus requested me to give you a hearty greeting, and to deliver this letter.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Just so. Take it, recognize the seal. Do you know it? <stage>LYCO takes the letter.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> I'll tell you; because it is but four days since we arrived in Caria, from India; there he now intends to order a solid golden statue to be made of Philippean gold, which is to be seven feet high--a memorial of his exploits.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCO</speaker><p> For what reason this? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> I'll tell you; why, because within twenty days he singly has subdued the Persians, Paphlagonians, Sinopians, Arabians, Cretans, Syrians, Rhodia and Lycia, Peredia and Bibesia<milestone n="444" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Peredia and Bibesia</lemma>:  Most of these names are real, while some are fictitious--as, for instance, "Peredia," "Hungry-land," and "Bibesia," "Thirsty-land."

"Conterebromia" is a name coined for the occasion, signifying "the and of piercing."</note>, and all Libya, and all Conterebromia; one half even of all nations has he conquered unaided in twenty days.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Maiden, do you go before; what is behind me I cannot keep my eye upon. Both the trinkets of gold, and all the clothing that she had, were his own, he said.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CAPPADOX</speaker><p> No one is going to deny it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> Still, however, it's somewhat better for me to remind you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCO</speaker><p> Remember that you've undertaken, that, if any one should assert in course of law that she's properly free, all the money is to be returned to me-thirty min&aelig;.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CAPPADOX</speaker><p> I shall remember; be easy about that; and now I say the same. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> But I wish you to remember this well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CAPPADOX</speaker><p> I remember, and I shall deliver her to you on warranty<milestone n="495" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">On warranty</lemma>:  "Dare mancupio" meant, "to sell a thing upon warranty," which, when formally done, was effected "per &aelig;s et libram," by striking the balance with an "as," in the presence of six witnesses, when the seller guaranteed the possession of it to the purchaser.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> And am I to take anything on warranty from a Procurer, people who have nothing of their own except a tongue only; who, if anything's entrusted them, deny it upon oath? You Procurers dispose of what belongs to others, you give liberty to what belongs to others, and what belongs to others your give your commands to; no guarantee of ownership is there in the transfer to yourselves, nor are you yourselves guarantees to another person. The race of Procurers, among mortals, in my way of thinking at least, are just like flies, gnats, bugs, lice, and fleas--a plague, a mischief, and a nuisance; you are of no serviceable use, and no respectable person dares to stand with you in the Forum; he that does associate with you, they censure him, he's spat upon and abused; they say that he has lost his property and his honor, although he has done nothing at all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCO</speaker><p> Upon my faith, my clever one-eyed friend, in my way of thinking, you are well acquainted with the Procurers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> You bankers, i' faith, I put and place in the same rank; you are the very counterparts of them. They, at least, are on sale in dark corners, you in the very Forum<milestone n="507" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In the very Forum</lemma>:  In allusion to the place where most of the bankers' shops were situate.</note>.

<sp><speaker>LYCO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I'd rather I'd held my tongue CAP. Not wrongfully, and with good reason, are you abusive against them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CURCULIO</speaker><p> If abuse is uttered against those who deserve it not, that I do hold to be abuse; but if it is uttered against those who are deserving, it is fair censure, in my way of thinking, at least. I care nothing about your warranty, nor about any other Procurer whatever. Lyco, do you want anything with me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCO</speaker><p> They shall be paid; order them to be fetched to-morrow. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CAPPADOX</speaker><p> Since I've successfully finished the matter, I wish to return thanks here in the Temple. For long since, when a little girl, I bought her for ten min&aelig;; but him who sold her to me, never since then have I set eyes upon. I think he's dead. What matters that to me? I've got the money.

"Why do you ask that?" said I. "Because I've need to know," said she. I said I wouldn't tell her. To get it away, she seized hold of my hand with her teeth.

<sp><speaker>PH&AElig;D.</speaker><p> For what reason so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THERAPONTIGONUS</speaker><p> Because he agreed with me on these terms to give it back: that if any one should assert her to be free born in due course of law, he would, without dispute, pay back all the money.</p></sp>
