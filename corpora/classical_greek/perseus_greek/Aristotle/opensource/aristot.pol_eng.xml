				<p><milestone n="1252a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Every state is as we see a sort of partnership,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek word had not acquired a specially political
						connotation as the English word &lsquo;community&rsquo; has.</note>
					and every partnership is formed with a view to some good &lpar;since all the
					actions of all mankind are done with a view to what they think to be
					good&rpar;. It is therefore evident that, while all partnerships aim at some
					good the partnership that is the most supreme of all and includes all the others
					does so most of all, and aims at the most supreme of all goods; and this is the
					partnership entitled the state, the political association. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those then who think that the natures of the
					statesman, the royal ruler, the head of an estate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">oi)kono/mos</foreign> denoting a higher
						grade than <foreign lang="greek">despo/ths</foreign> is unusual. For their
						ordinary use see 2.1 fin.</note> and the master of a family are the same,
					are mistaken &lpar;they imagine that the difference between these various
					forms of authority is one of greater and smaller numbers, not a difference in
					the kind&mdash;that is, that the ruler over a few people is a master, over
					more the head of an estate, over more still a statesman or royal ruler, as if
					there were no difference between a large household and a small city; and also as
					to the statesman and the royal ruler, they think that one who governs as sole
					head is royal, and one who, while the government follows the principles of the
					science of royalty, takes turns to govern and be governed is a statesman; but
					these views are not true&rpar;. <milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And a proof that these people are mistaken will appear if we examine the
					question in accordance with our regular method of investigation. In every other
					matter it is necessary to analyze the composite whole down to its uncompounded
					elements &lpar;for these are the smallest <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>parts of the whole&rpar;; so too with the state, by
					examining the elements of which it is composed we shall better discern in
					relation to these different kinds of rulers what is the difference between them,
					and whether it is possible to obtain any scientific precision in regard to the
					various statements made above.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In this subject as
					in others the best method of investigation is to study things in the process of
					development from the beginning. <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					first coupling together of persons then to which necessity gives rise is that
					between those who are unable to exist without one another: for instance the
					union of female and male for the continuance of the species &lpar;and this
					not of deliberate purpose, but with man as with the other animals and with
					plants there is a natural instinct to desire to leave behind one another being
					of the same sort as oneself&rpar;; and the union of natural ruler and
					natural subject for the sake of security &lpar;for he that can foresee with
					his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these
						things<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A probable emendation gives
						&lsquo;that can carry out labor.&rsquo;</note> with his body is
					subject and naturally a slave; so that master and slave have the same
					interest&rpar;. <milestone n="1252b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus
					the female and the slave are by nature distinct &lpar;for nature makes
					nothing as the cutlers make the Delphic knife,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Uncertain: possibly a dagger and a carving-knife in
						one.</note> in a niggardly way, but one thing for one purpose; for so each
					tool will be turned out in the finest perfection, if it serves not many uses but
					one&rpar;. Yet among barbarians the female and the slave have the same rank;
					and the cause of this is that barbarians have no class of natural rulers, but
					with them the conjugal partnership is a partnership of female slave and male
					slave. Hence the saying of the poets<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. IA 1400">Eur. IA 1400</bibl>.</note>&mdash; <quote type="verse">
						<l met="iambic">'Tis meet that Greeks should rule barbarians,&mdash;</l>
					</quote> implying that barbarian and slave are the same in nature. <milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>From these two partnerships then is first
					composed the household, and Hesiod<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hes. WD 405">Hes. WD 405</bibl>.</note> was right when he wrote
						<quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">First and foremost a house and a wife and an ox for the
							ploughing&mdash;</l>
					</quote> for the ox serves instead of a servant for the poor. The partnership
					therefore that comes about in the course of nature for everyday purposes is the
					&lsquo;house,&rsquo; the persons whom Charondas<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A law-giver of <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
						6th century B.C. or earlier.</note> speaks of as
					&lsquo;meal-tub-fellows&rsquo; and the Cretan Epimenides<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A poet and prophet invited to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
						<date value="-596">596</date> B.C. to purify it of plague.</note> as
						&lsquo;manger-fellows.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						variant reading <foreign lang="greek">o(moka/pnous</foreign>,
						&lsquo;smoke-sharers,&rsquo; seems to mean
						&lsquo;hearth-fellows.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On
					the other hand the primary partnership made up of several households for the
					satisfaction of not mere daily needs is the village. The village according to
					the most natural account seems to be a colony from<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give
						&lsquo;consists of colonies from.&rsquo;</note> a household, formed
					of those whom some people speak of as &lsquo;fellow-sucklings,&rsquo;
					sons and sons' sons.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The words
						&lsquo;sons and sons' sons&rsquo; are probably an interpolated
						note.</note> It is owing to this that our cities were at first under royal
					sway and that foreign races are so still,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they were made up of parts that were under royal rule;
					for every household is under the royal rule of its eldest member, so that the
					colonies from the household were so too, because of the kinship of their
					members. And this is what Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.114">Hom. Od. 9.114 f.</bibl> on the Cyclopes.</note>
					means: <quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">And each one giveth law</l>
						<l>To sons and eke to spouses&mdash;</l>
					</quote> for his Cyclopes live in scattered families; and that is the way in
					which people used to live in early times. Also this explains why all races speak
					of the gods as ruled by a king, because they themselves too are some of them
					actually now so ruled and in other cases used to be of old; and as men imagine
					the gods in human form, so also they suppose their manner of life to be like
					their own. <milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The partnership finally composed of several villages is the
					city-state; it has at last attained the limit of virtually complete
					self-sufficiency, and thus, while it comes into existence for the sake of life,
					it exists for the good life. Hence every city-state exists by nature, inasmuch
					as the first partnerships so exist; for the city-state is the end of the other
					partnerships, and nature is an end, since that which each thing is when its
					growth is completed we speak of as being the nature of each thing, for instance
					of a man, a horse, a household. Again, the object for which a thing exists, its
					end, is its chief good; <milestone n="1253a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and self-sufficiency is an end, and a chief good.
						<milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>From these things therefore it
					is clear that the city-state is a natural growth, and that man is by nature a
					political animal, and a man that is by nature and not merely by fortune citiless
					is either low in the scale of humanity or above it &lpar;like the <quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">clanless, lawless, hearthless</l>
					</quote> man reviled by Homer,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.63">Hom. Il. 9.63</bibl>; the passage goes on: <foreign lang="greek">e)sti\n e)kei=nos | o(\s pole/mou
						e)/ratai</foreign>.</note> for one by nature unsocial is also &lsquo;a
					lover of war&rsquo;&rpar; inasmuch as he is solitary, like an isolated
					piece at draughts. <milestone n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And why man is a
					political animal in a greater measure than any bee or any gregarious animal is
					clear. For nature, as we declare, does nothing without purpose; and man alone of
					the animals possesses speech. The mere voice, it is true, can indicate pain and
					pleasure, and therefore is possessed by the other animals as well &lpar;for
					their nature has been developed so far as to have sensations of what is painful
					and pleasant and to indicate those sensations to one another&rpar;, but
					speech is designed to indicate the advantageous and the harmful, and therefore
					also the right and the wrong; <milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for
					it is the special property of man in distinction from the other animals that he
					alone has perception of good and bad and right and wrong and the other moral
					qualities, and it is partnership in these things that makes a household and a
						city-state.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus also the city-state is prior
					in nature to the household and to each of us individually.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For the whole must necessarily be prior to the
					part; since when the whole body is destroyed, foot or hand will not exist except
					in an equivocal sense, like the sense in which one speaks of a hand sculptured
					in stone as a hand; because a hand in those circumstances will be a hand
					spoiled, and all things are defined by their function and capacity, so that when
					they are no longer such as to perform their function they must not be said to be
					the same things, but to bear their names in an equivocal sense. <milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear therefore that the state is
					also prior by nature to the individual; for if each individual when separate is
					not self-sufficient, he must be related to the whole state as other parts are to
					their whole, while a man who is incapable of entering into partnership, or who
					is so self-sufficing that he has no need to do so, is no part of a state, so
					that he must be either a lower animal or a god.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Therefore the impulse to form a partnership of this kind is present in all men
					by nature; but the man who first united people in such a partnership was the
					greatest of benefactors. For as man is the best of the animals when perfected,
					so he is the worst of all when sundered from law and justice. For
					unrighteousness is most pernicious when possessed of weapons, and man is born
					possessing weapons for the use of wisdom and virtue, which it is possible to
					employ entirely for the opposite ends. Hence when devoid of virtue man is the
					most unholy and savage of animals, and the worst in regard to sexual indulgence
					and gluttony. Justice on the other hand is an element of the state; for judicial
					procedure, which means the decision of what is just, is the regulation of the
					political partnership. <milestone n="1253b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And now that it is clear what are the
					component parts of the state, we have first of all to discuss household
					management; for every state is composed of households. Household management
					falls into departments corresponding to the parts of which the household in its
					turn is composed; and the household in its perfect form consists of slaves and
					freemen. The investigation of everything should begin with its smallest parts,
					and the primary and smallest parts of the household are master and slave,
					husband and wife, father and children; we ought therefore to examine the proper
					constitution and character of each of these three relationships, <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>I mean that of mastership, that of
						marriage<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek word properly denotes
						the marriage ceremony, not the married state.</note> &lpar;there is no
					exact term denoting the relation uniting wife and husband&rpar;, and thirdly
					the progenitive relationship &lpar;this too has not been designated by a
					special name&rpar;. Let us then accept these three relationships that we
					have mentioned. There is also a department which some people consider the same
					as household management and others the most important part of it, and the true
					position of which we shall have to consider: I mean what is called the art of
					getting wealth.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">No English word covers all
						the associations of the Greek, which means &lsquo;dealing in <foreign lang="greek">xrh/mata</foreign>,&rsquo;
						&lsquo;things,&rsquo;&mdash;goods, property, money&mdash;and
						so &lsquo;business.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let us begin by discussing the relation of master
					and slave, in order to observe the facts that have a bearing on practical
					utility, and also in the hope that we may be able to obtain something better
					than the notions at present entertained, with a view to a theoretic knowledge of
					the subject. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For some thinkers hold
					the function of the master to be a definite science, and moreover think that
					household management, mastership, statesmanship and monarchy are the same
						thing,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as we said at the beginning
					of the treatise; others however maintain that for one man to be another man's
					master is contrary to nature, because it is only convention that makes the one a
					slave and the other a freeman and there is no difference between them by nature,
					and that therefore it is unjust, for it is based on force.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Since therefore property is a part of a household and the art
					of acquiring property a part of household management &lpar;for without the
					necessaries even life, as well as the good life,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;As well as the good life&rsquo; is probably an
						interpolation.</note> is impossible&rpar;, <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and since, just as for the particular arts it would be
					necessary for the proper tools to be forthcoming if their work is to be
					accomplished, so also the manager of a household must have his tools, and of
					tools some are lifeless and others living &lpar;for example, for a helmsman
					the rudder is a lifeless tool and the look-out man a live tool&mdash;for an
					assistant in the arts belongs to the class of tools&rpar;, so also an
					article of property is a tool for the purpose of life, and property generally is
					a collection of tools, and a slave is a live article of property. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And every assistant is as it were a tool
					that serves for several tools; for if every tool could perform its own work when
					ordered, or by seeing what to do in advance, like the statues of Daedalus in the
						story,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This legendary sculptor first
						represented the eyes as open and the limbs as in motion, so his statues had
						to be chained to prevent them from running away &lpar;<bibl n="Plat. Meno 97d">Plat. Meno 97d</bibl>&rpar;.</note> or the
					tripods of Hephaestus which the poet says &lsquo;enter self-moved the
					company divine,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.369">Hom. Il. 18.369</bibl>
					</note>&mdash;if thus shuttles wove and quills played harps of themselves,
					master-craftsmen would have no need of assistants and masters no need of slaves.
						<milestone n="1254a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Now the tools mentioned are instruments of production, whereas
					an article of property is an instrument of action<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. with it we do not <emph>make</emph> something but
							<emph>do</emph> something &lpar;e.g. wear a dress, lie in a
						bed&rpar;.</note>; for from a shuttle we get something else beside the
					mere use of the shuttle, but from a garment or a bed we get only their use.
						<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also inasmuch as there is a
					difference in kind between production and action, and both need tools, it
					follows that those tools also must possess the same difference. But life is
					doing things, not making things; hence the slave is an assistant in the class of
					instruments of action.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And the term
					&lsquo;article of property&rsquo; is used in the same way as the term
					&lsquo;part&rsquo;: a thing that is a part is not only a part of another
					thing but absolutely belongs to another thing, and so also does an article of
					property. Hence whereas the master is merely the slave's master and does not
					belong to the slave, the slave is not merely the slave of the master but wholly
					belongs to the master. <milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These
					considerations therefore make clear the nature of the slave and his essential
					quality: one who is a human being belonging by nature not to himself but to
					another is by nature a slave, and a person is a human being belonging to another
					if being a man he is an article of property, and an article of property
					is an instrument for action separable from its owner. But we must next consider
					whether or not anyone exists who is by nature of this character, and whether it
					is advantageous and just for anyone to be a slave, or whether on the contrary
					all slavery is against nature.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is not difficult either
					to discern the answer by theory or to learn it empirically. Authority and
					subordination are conditions not only inevitable but also expedient; in some
					cases things are marked out from the moment of birth to rule or to be ruled. And
					there are many varieties both of rulers and of subjects &lpar;and the higher
					the type of the subjects, the loftier is the nature of the authority exercised
					over them, for example to control a human being is a higher thing than to tame a
					wild beast; for the higher the type of the parties to the performance of a
					function, the higher is the function, and when one party rules and another is
					ruled, there is a function performed between them&rpar;&mdash;<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>because in every composite thing, where a
					plurality of parts, whether continuous or discrete, is combined to make a single
					common whole, there is always found a ruling and a subject factor, and this
					characteristic of living things is present in them as an outcome of the whole of
					nature, since even in things that do not partake of life there is a ruling
					principle, as in the case of a musical scale.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Each &lsquo;mode&rsquo; &lpar;Dorian, the modern minor scale,
						Phrygian and Lydian, two forms of major&rpar; was ruled by its
						key-note.</note> However, this matter perhaps belongs to an investigation
					lying somewhat outside our subject; <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but an animal consists primarily of soul and body, of which the former is by
					nature the ruling and the latter the subject factor. And to discover what is
					natural we must study it preferably in things that are in a natural state, and
					not in specimens that are degenerate. Hence in studying man we must consider a
					man that is in the best possible condition in regard to both body and soul, and
					in him the principle stated will clearly appear,&mdash; <milestone n="1254b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since in those
					that are bad or in a bad condition it might be thought that the body often rules
					the soul because of its vicious and unnatural condition. <milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But to resume&mdash;it is in a living creature,
					as we say, that it is first possible to discern the rule both of master and of
					statesman the soul rules the body with the sway of a master, the intelligence
					rules the appetites with that of a statesman or a king and in these examples it
					is manifest that it is natural and expedient for the body to be governed by the
					soul and for the emotional part to be governed by the intellect, the part
					possessing reason, whereas for the two parties to be on an equal footing or in
					the contrary positions is harmful in all cases. <milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the same holds good between man and the other
					animals: tame animals are superior in their nature to wild animals, yet for all
					the former it is advantageous to be ruled by man, since this gives them
					security. Again, as between the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the
					female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject. And the same must also
					necessarily apply in the case of mankind as a whole; <milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>therefore all men that differ as widely as the soul does
					from the body and the human being from the lower animal &lpar;and this is
					the condition of those whose function is the use of the body and from whom this
					is the best that is forthcoming&rpar; these are by nature slaves, for whom
					to be governed by this kind of authority<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is advantageous, inasmuch as it is advantageous to the subject
					things already mentioned. For he is by nature a slave who is capable of
					belonging to another &lpar;and that is why he does so belong&rpar;, and
					who participates in reason so far as to apprehend it but not to possess it; for
					the animals other than man are subservient not to reason, by apprehending it,
					but to feelings. <milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also the
					usefulness of slaves diverges little from that of animals; bodily service for
					the necessities of life is forthcoming from both, from slaves and from domestic
					animals alike. The intention of nature therefore is to make the bodies also of
					freemen and of slaves different&mdash;the latter strong for necessary
					service, the former erect and unserviceable for such occupations, but
					serviceable for a life of citizenship &lpar;and that again divides into the
					employments of war and those of peace&rpar;; but as a matter of fact often
					the very opposite comes about&mdash;some persons have the bodies of free men
					and others the souls; <milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>since this is
					certainly clear, that if persons were born as distinguished only in body as are
					the statues of the gods, everyone would say that those who were inferior
					deserved to be these men's slaves. And if this is true in the case of the body,
					there is far juster reason for this rule being laid down in the case of the
					soul; but beauty of soul is not so easy to see as beauty of body. <milestone n="1255a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>It is
					manifest therefore that there are cases of people of whom some are freemen and
					the others slaves by nature, and for these slavery is an institution both
					expedient and just. <milestone n="2.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But at the same
					time it is not difficult to see that those who assert the opposite are also
					right in a manner. The fact is that the terms &lsquo;slavery&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;slave&rsquo; are ambiguous; for there is also such a thing as a
					slave or a man that is in slavery by law, for the law is a sort of agreement
					under which the things conquered in war are said to belong to their conquerors.
					Now this conventional right is arraigned by many jurists just as a statesman is
					impeached for proposing an unconstitutional measure; they say that it is
					monstrous if the person powerful enough to use force, and superior in power, is
					to have the victim of his force as his slave and subject; and even among the
					learned some hold this view, though others hold the other. <milestone n="2.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the reason of this dispute and what makes the
					theories overlap is the fact that in a certain manner virtue when it obtains
					resources has in fact very great power to use force, and the stronger party
					always possesses superiority in something that is good,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The difficulty turns on the ambiguity of <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign>, &lpar;a&rpar; moral goodness,
						virtue, &lpar;b&rpar; goodness of any kind, e.g. strength.</note> so
					that it is thought that force cannot be devoid of goodness, but that the dispute
					is merely about the justice of the matter &lpar;for it is due to the one
					party holding that the justification of authority is good-will, while the other
					identifies justice with the mere rule of the stronger&rpar;; because
					obviously if these theories be separated apart,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the other theories have no force or plausibility at all,
					implying that the superior in goodness has no claim to rule and be master.
						<milestone n="2.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But some persons, simply
					clinging, as they think, to principle of justice &lpar;for the law is a
					principle of justice&rpar;, assert that the enslavement of prisoners of war
					is just; yet at the same time they deny the assertion, for there is the
					possibility that wars may be unjust in their origin and one would by no means
					admit that a man that does not deserve slavery can be really a
					slave&mdash;otherwise we shall have the result that persons reputed of the
					highest nobility are slaves and the descendants of slaves if they happen to be
					taken prisoners of war and sold. Therefore they do not mean to assert that
					Greeks themselves if taken prisoners are slaves, but that barbarians are. Yet
					when they say this, they are merely seeking for the principles of natural
					slavery of which we spoke at the outset; for they are compelled to say that
					there exist certain persons who are essentially slaves everywhere and certain
					others who are so nowhere. <milestone n="2.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the
					same applies also about nobility: our nobles consider themselves noble not only
					in their own country but everywhere, but they think that barbarian noblemen are
					only noble in their own country&mdash;which implies that there are two kinds
					of nobility and of freedom, one absolute and the other relative, as Helen says
					in Theodectes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A tragic poet, a friend of
						Aristotle.</note>: <quote type="verse">
						<l met="iambic">But who would dare to call me menial,</l>

					</quote> Yet in so speaking they make nothing but virtue and vice the
					distinction between slave and free, the noble and the base-born; <milestone n="1255b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they
					assume that just as from a man springs a man and from brutes a brute, so also
					from good parents comes a good son but as a matter of fact nature frequently
					while intending to do this is unable to bring it about.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is clear therefore that there is some reason for this
					dispute, and that in some instances it is not the case that one set are slaves
					and the other freemen by nature; <milestone n="2.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and also that in some instances such a distinction does exist, when slavery
					for the one and mastership for the other are advantageous and just, and it is
					proper for the one party to be governed and for the other to govern by the form
					of government for which they are by nature fitted, and therefore by the exercise
					of mastership, while to govern badly is to govern disadvantageously for both
					parties &lpar;for the same thing is advantageous for a part and for the
					whole body or the whole soul, and the slave is a part of the master&mdash;he
					is, as it were, a part of the body, alive but yet separated from it; <milestone n="2.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>hence there is a certain community of
					interest and friendship between slave and master in cases when they have been
					qualified by nature for those positions, although when they do not hold them in
					that way but by law and by constraint of force the opposite is the
						case&rpar;.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And even from these
					considerations it is clear that the authority of a master over slaves is not the
					same as the authority of a magistrate in a republic, nor are all forms of
					government the same, as some assert. Republican government controls men who are
					by nature free, the master's authority men who are by nature slaves; and the
					government of a household is monarchy &lpar;since every house is governed by
					a single ruler&rpar;,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>whereas
					statesmanship is the government of men free and equal. <milestone n="2.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term &lsquo;master&rsquo; therefore
					denotes the possession not of a certain branch of knowledge but of a certain
					character, and similarly also the terms &lsquo;slave&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;freeman.&rsquo; Yet there might be a science of mastership and a
					slave's science&mdash;the latter being the sort of knowledge that used to be
					imparted by the professor at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> &lpar;for there used to be a man there who for a
					fee gave lessons to servants in their ordinary duties&rpar;; and indeed
					there might be more advanced scientific study of such matters, for instance a
					science of cookery and the other such kinds of domestic service&mdash;for
					different servants have different functions, some more honorable and some more
					menial, and as the proverb says, <quote type="verse">
						<l met="iambic">Slave before slave and master before master.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably from a comedy of Aristotle's
								contemporary Philemon.</note></l>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="2.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The slave's sciences then are all
					the various branches of domestic work; the master's science is the science of
					employing slaves&mdash;for the master's function consists not in acquiring
					slaves but in employing them. This science however is one of no particular
					importance or dignity: the master must know how to direct the tasks which the
					slave must know how to execute. Therefore all people rich enough to be able to
					avoid personal trouble have a steward who takes this office, while they
					themselves engage in politics or philosophy. The science of acquiring slaves is
					different both from their ownership and their direction&mdash;that is, the
					just acquiring of slaves, which is akin to the art of war or that of the chase.
					Let this then stand as our definition of slave and master. <milestone n="1256a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But let us follow our normal method and investigate
					generally the nature of all kinds of property and the art of getting wealth,
					inasmuch as we saw the slave to be one division of property. In the first place
					therefore one might raise the question whether the art of getting wealth is the
					same as that of household management, or a part of it, or subsidiary to it; and
					if subsidiary, whether it is so in the sense in which the art of making shuttles
					is subsidiary to the art of weaving or in that in which the art of casting
					bronze is subsidiary to the making of statues &lpar;for the two are not
					subsidiary in the same way, but shuttle-making supplies tools whereas
					bronze-founding supplies material&mdash;and by material I mean the substance
					out of which certain work is produced, for example fleeces are material for a
					weaver and bronze for a statuary&rpar;. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now it is clear that wealth-getting is not the same art as
					household management, for the function of the former is to provide and that of
					the latter to use&mdash;for what will be the art that will use the contents
					of the house if not the art of household management? but whether wealth-getting
					is a part of the art of household management, or a different sort of science, is
					open to debate. For if it is the function of the getter of wealth to study the
					source from which money and property are to be procured, . . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some words seem to have fallen out in the
						Greek.</note> But property and riches comprise many divisions; hence first
					of all is husbandry a division of the household art, or is it a different kind
					of science? and so in general of the superintendence and acquisition of articles
					of food. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But furthermore, there are
					many sorts of food,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>owing to which
					both animals and men have many modes of life; for it is impossible to live
					without food, so that the differences of food have made the lives of animals
					different. Among wild animals some are nomadic and others solitary, according to
					whichever habit is advantageous for their supply of food, because some of them
					are carnivorous, others graminivorous, and others eat all kinds of food; so that
					nature has differentiated their modes of life to suit their facilities and their
					predilection for those articles of food. And as different kinds of animals by
					nature relish different sorts of food, and not each kind the same, even within
					the classes of carnivorous and graminivorous animals their modes of life differ
					from one another. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And similarly in
					the human race also, for there are wide differences of life among mankind. The
					idlest men are nomads &lpar;for to procure food from domesticated animals
					involves no toil or industry, but as it is necessary for the herds to move from
					place to place because of the pastures, the people themselves are forced to
					follow along with them, as though they were farming a live farm&rpar;. Other
					men live from hunting, and different people from different kinds of hunting, for
					instance some from brigandage,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps
						&lsquo;slave-raiding,&rsquo; cf. 3.9, the appropriation of the
						&lsquo;live tools&rsquo; that are a part of nature's supplies; but
							<bibl n="Thuc. 1.5">Thuc. 1.5</bibl> speaks of brigandage and piracy as
						common in earlier times, and as still deemed respectable professions in
						Northern Greece.</note> others from fishing&mdash;these are those that
					dwell on the banks of lakes, marshes and rivers or of a sea suitable for
					fishing,&mdash;and others live on wild birds and animals. But the largest
					class of men live from the land and the fruits of cultivation. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This then virtually completes the list of
					the various modes of life, those at least that have their industry sprung from
					themselves and do not procure their food by barter and trade&mdash;
						<milestone n="1256b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the lives of the herdsman, the brigand, the fisherman, the
					hunter, the husband-man. Others also live pleasantly by combining some of these
					pursuits, supplementing the more deficient life where it happens to fall short
					in regard to being self-sufficing: for instance, some combine a pastoral life
					and brigandage, others husbandry and hunting, and similarly with the
					others&mdash;they pass their time in such a combination of pursuits as their
					need compels. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Property of this sort
					then seems to be bestowed by nature herself upon all, as immediately upon their
					first coming into existence, so also when they have reached maturity. For even
					at the original coming into existence of the young some kinds of animals bring
					forth with them at birth enough sustenance to suffice until the offspring can
					provide for itself, for example all the species that bear their young in the
					form of larvae or in eggs. The viviparous species have sustenance for their
					offspring inside themselves for a certain period, the substance called milk.
						<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So that clearly we must suppose
					that nature also provides for them in a similar way when grown up, and that
					plants exist for the sake of animals and the other animals for the good of man,
					the domestic species both for his service and for his food, and if not all at
					all events most of the wild ones for the sake of his food and of his supplies of
					other kinds, in order that<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they may
					furnish him both with clothing and with other appliances. If therefore nature
					makes nothing without purpose or in vain, it follows that nature has made all
					the animals for the sake of men. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence even the art of war will by nature be in a manner an art of acquisition
					&lpar;for the art of hunting is a part of it&rpar; that is properly
					employed both against wild animals and against such of mankind as though
					designed by nature for subjection refuse to submit to it, inasmuch as this
					warfare is by nature just.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>One kind of acquisition
					therefore in the order of nature is a part of the household art,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Rassow would transpose the clause
						&lpar;with a slight alteration&rpar; to give &lsquo;of the
						household art, that is, the acquisition of those goods capable of
						accumulation that are necessary for life and useful for the community of
						city and household, a supply of which must be forthcoming or else the art
						must procure it to be forthcoming.&rsquo;</note> in accordance with
					which either there must be forthcoming or else that art must procure to be
					forthcoming a supply of those goods, capable of accumulation, which are
					necessary for life and useful for the community of city or household. <milestone n="3.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is of these goods that riches in the
					true sense at all events seem to consist. For the amount of such property
					sufficient in itself for a good life is not unlimited, as Solon <note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Sol. Fr. 13.71">Solon
						13.71</bibl>.</note> says that it is in the verse <quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">But of riches no bound has been fixed or revealed to
							men;</l>
					</quote> for a limit has been fixed, as with the other arts, since no tool
					belonging to any art is without a limit whether in number or in size, and riches
					are a collection of tools for the householder and the statesman. Therefore that
					there is a certain art of acquisition belonging in the order of nature to
					householders and to statesmen, and for what reason this is so, is clear.
						<milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is another kind of
					acquisition that is specially called wealth-getting, and that is so called with
					justice and to this kind it is due that there is thought to be no limit to
					riches and property. <milestone n="1257a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Owing to its affinity to the art of acquisition of
					which we spoke, it is supposed by many people to be one and the same as that;
					and as a matter of fact, while it is not the same as the acquisition spoken of,
					it is not far removed from it. One of them is natural, the other is not natural,
					but carried on rather by means of a certain acquired skill or art. We may take
					our starting-point for its study from the following consideration: <milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>with every article of property there is a
					double way of using it; both uses are related to the article itself, but not
					related to it in the same manner&mdash;one is peculiar to the thing and the
					other is not peculiar to it. Take for example a shoe&mdash;there is its wear
					as a shoe and there is its use as an article of exchange; for both are ways of
					using a shoe, inasmuch as even he that barters a shoe for money or food with the
					customer that wants a shoe uses it as a shoe, though not for the use peculiar to
					a shoe, since shoes have not come into existence for the purpose of barter. And
					the same also holds good about the other articles of property; for all of them
					have an art of exchange related to them, which began in the first instance from
					the natural order of things, because men had more than enough of some things and
					less than enough of others. <milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This
					consideration also shows that the art of trade is not by nature a part of the
					art of wealth-getting<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps Aristotle wrote
						&lsquo;of the art of exchange&rsquo;: Bernays suggests <foreign lang="greek">metablhtikh=s</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">xrhmatistikh=s</foreign>.</note>; for the practice of barter was
					necessary only so far as to satisfy men's own needs. In the primary<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>association therefore &lpar;I mean the
					household&rpar; there is no function for trade, but it only arises after the
					association has become more numerous. For the members of the primitive household
					used to share commodities that were all their own, whereas on the contrary a
					group divided into several households participated also in a number of
					commodities belonging to their neighbors, according to their needs for which
					they were forced to make their interchanges by way of barter, as also many
					barbarian tribes do still; for such tribes do not go beyond exchanging actual
					commodities for actual commodities, for example giving and taking wine for corn,
					and so with the various other things of the sort. <milestone n="3.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Exchange on these lines therefore is not contrary to
					nature, nor is it any branch of the art of wealth-getting, for it existed for
					the replenishment of natural self-sufficiency; yet out of it the art of business
					in due course arose. For when they had come to supply themselves more from
					abroad by importing things in which they were deficient and exporting those of
					which they had a surplus, the employment of money necessarily came to be
					devised. For the natural necessaries are not in every case readily portable;
						<milestone n="3.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>hence for the purpose of barter
					men made a mutual compact to give and accept some substance of such a sort as
					being itself a useful commodity was easy to handle in use for general life, iron
					for instance, silver and other metals, at the first stage defined merely by size
					and weight, but finally also by impressing on it a stamp in order that this
					might relieve them of having to measure it; for the stamp was put on as a token
					of the amount. <milestone n="1257b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="3.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So when currency
					had been now invented as an outcome of the necessary interchange of goods, there
					came into existence the other form of wealth-getting, trade, which at first no
					doubt went on in a simple form, but later became more highly organized as
					experience discovered the sources and methods of exchange that would cause most
					profit. Hence arises the idea that the art of wealth-getting deals specially
					with money, and that its function is to be able to discern from what source a
					large supply can be procured, as this art is supposed to be creative of riches
					and wealth; <milestone n="3.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>indeed riches are often
					assumed to consist of a quantity of money, because money is the thing with which
					the art of business and of trade deals. But at other times, on the contrary, it
					is thought that money is nonsense, and nothing by nature but entirely a
					convention, because when those who use it have changed the currency it is worth
					nothing, and because it is of no use for any of the necessary needs of life and
					a man well supplied with money may often<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g.
						on a desert island.</note> be destitute of the bare necessities of
					subsistence, yet it is anomalous that wealth should be of such a kind that a man
					may be well supplied with it and yet die of hunger, like the famous Midas in the
					legend, when owing to the insatiable covetousness of his prayer all the viands
					served up to him turned into gold. <milestone n="3.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence people seek for a different definition of riches and the art of getting
					wealth, and rightly; for natural wealth-getting and natural riches are
						different:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>natural wealth-getting
					belongs to household management, whereas the other kind belongs to trade,
					producing goods not in every way but only by the method of exchanging goods. It
					is this art of wealth-getting that is thought to be concerned with money, for
					money is the first principle and limit of commerce. And these riches, that are
					derived from this art of wealth-getting, are truly unlimited<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. a trader cannot get too much of his goods, any more than
						a doctor can make his patient too healthy.</note>; for just as the art of
					medicine is without limit in respect of health, and each of the arts is without
					limit in respect of its end &lpar;for they desire to produce that in the
					highest degree possible&rpar;, whereas they are not without limit as regards
					the means to their end &lpar;for with all of them the end is a limit to the
					means&rpar;, so also this wealth-getting has no limit in respect of its end,
					and its end is riches and the acquisition of goods in the commercial sense.
						<milestone n="3.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the household branch of
					wealth-getting has a limit, since the acquisition of commercial riches is not
					the function of household management. Hence from this point of view it appears
					necessary that there should be a limit to all riches, yet in actual fact we
					observe that the opposite takes place; for all men engaged in wealth-getting try
					to increase their money to an unlimited amount. The reason of this is the close
					affinity of the two branches of the art of business. Their common ground is that
					the thing that each makes use of is the same; they use the same property,
					although not in the same way&mdash;the one has another end in view, the aim
					of the other is the increase of the property. Consequently some people suppose
					that it is the function of household management to increase property, and they
					are continually under the idea that it is their duty to be either safeguarding
					their substance in money or increasing it to an unlimited amount. <milestone n="3.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The cause of this state of mind is that
					their interests are set upon life but not upon the good life; <milestone n="1258a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as
					therefore the desire for life is unlimited, they also desire without limit the
					means productive of life. And even those who fix their aim on the good life seek
					the good life as measured by bodily enjoyments, so that inasmuch as this also
					seems to be found in the possession of property, all their energies are occupied
					in the business of getting wealth; and owing to this the second kind of the art
					of wealth-getting has arisen. For as their enjoyment is in excess, they try to
					discover the art that is productive of enjoyable excess; and if they cannot
					procure it by the art of wealth-getting, they try to do so by some other means,
					employing each of the faculties in an unnatural way. <milestone n="3.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is not the function of courage to produce wealth,
					but to inspire daring; nor is it the function of the military art nor of the
					medical art, but it belongs to the former to bring victory and to the latter to
					cause health. Yet these people make all these faculties means for the business
					of providing wealth, in the belief that wealth is the end and that everything
					must be directed to the end.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have therefore
					discussed both the unnecessary branch of wealth-getting, defining it and also
					explaining the cause why we require it, and the necessary branch, showing that
					this branch which has to do with food is different from the unnecessary branch
					and is by nature a part of household management, not being like that branch
					unlimited but having a limit. <milestone n="3.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					we can also see the answer to the question raised at the beginning,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 3.1.</note> whether<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the art of wealth-getting belongs to the
					householder and the statesman, or whether on the contrary supplies ought to be
					provided already &lpar;for just as statesmanship does not create human
					beings but having received them from nature makes use of them, so also it is
					necessary for nature to bestow food by bestowing land or sea or something
					else&rpar;, and the task of the householder is, starting with these supplies
					given, to dispose of them in the proper way. For it does not belong to the art
					of weaving to make fleeces, but to use them, and also to know what sort of
					fleece is good and suitable or bad and unsuitable. <milestone n="3.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In fact the question might be raised, why the getting of
					wealth is a part of the household art whereas the art of medicine is not a part
					of it, although the members of the household ought to be healthy, just as they
					must be alive or fulfil any of the other essential conditions. But inasmuch as
					although in a way it does belong to the householder and the ruler to see even to
					health, yet in a way it does not belong to them but to the physician, so also
					with regard to wealth, although in a way it is the affair of the house-holder,
					in a way it is not, but is a matter for the subsidiary art. But best of all, as
					has been said before, this provision ought to be made in advance by nature. For
					it is the work of nature to supply nourishment for her offspring, since every
					creature has for nourishment the residue of the substance from which it
						springs.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. animals are made of earth
						and water and live on the products of earth and water.</note> Hence the
					business of drawing provision from the fruits of the soil and from animals is
					natural to all. <milestone n="3.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But, as we said,
					this art is twofold, one branch being of the nature of trade while the other
					belongs to the household art; and the latter branch is necessary and in good
					esteem, but the branch connected with exchange is justly discredited <milestone n="1258b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&lpar;for it is not in accordance with nature, but involves men's taking
					things from one another&rpar;. As this is so, usury is most reasonably
					hated, because its gain comes from money itself and not from that for the sake
					of which money was invented. For money was brought into existence for the
					purpose of exchange, but interest increases the amount of the money itself
					&lpar;and this is the actual origin of the Greek word: offspring resembles
					parent, and interest is money born of money&rpar;; consequently this form of
					the business of getting wealth is of all forms the most contrary to nature.
						<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we have adequately
					defined the scientific side of the subject, we ought to discuss it from the
					point of view of practice; although, whereas the theory of such matters is a
					liberal study, the practical pursuit of them is narrowing. The practically
					useful branches of the art of wealth-getting are first, an expert knowledge of
					stock, what breeds are most profitable and in what localities and under what
					conditions, for instance what particular stock in horses or cattle or sheep, and
					similarly of the other animals also &lpar;for the farmer must be an expert
					as to which of these animals are most profitable compared with one another, and
					also as to what breeds are most profitable on what sorts of land, since
					different breeds flourish in different places&rpar;; secondly, the subject
					of agriculture, and this again is divided into corn-growing and fruit-farming;
					also bee-keeping, and the breeding of the other creatures finned and
						feathered<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which can be used to
					furnish supplies. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These then are the
					branches and primary parts of wealth-getting in the most proper sense. Of the
					kind that deals with exchange, the largest branch is commerce &lpar;which
					has three departments, ship-owning, transport and marketing: these departments
					differ from each other in the fact that some are safer and others carry larger
					profits&rpar;; the second branch is money-lending, and the third labor for
					hire, one department of which is that of the mechanic<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">ba/nausos</foreign>&lpar;said to be
						from <foreign lang="greek">bau=nos</foreign>&lsquo;furnace,&rsquo;
							<foreign lang="greek">au)/w</foreign>&lsquo;to
						dry&rsquo;&rpar;, &lsquo;artisan&rsquo; &lpar;ranged
						with farmers, traders, and laborers, as forming the common people 1321a

						&lpar;1341a 7&rpar; and &lsquo;vulgar in taste&rsquo;
						&lpar;1337b 8&rpar;.</note> arts and the other that of unskilled
					laborers who are useful only for bodily service. And there is a third form of
					wealth-getting that lies between the latter and the one placed first, since it
					possesses mediate an element both of natural wealth-getting and of the sort that
					employs exchange; it deals with all the commodities that are obtained from the
					earth and from those fruitless but useful things that come from the
					earth&mdash;examples are the felling of timber<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">a very probable variant gives &lsquo;the quarrying of
						stone.&rsquo;</note> and all sorts of mining; and of mining itself there
					are many classes, since there are many sorts of metals obtained out of the
					earth. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the mss. this sentence follows the next one.</note> most
					scientific of these industries are those which involve the smallest element of
					chance, the most mechanic those in which the operatives undergo the greatest
					amount of bodily degradation, the most servile those in which the most uses are
					made of the body, and the most ignoble those in which there is the least
					requirement of virtue as an accessory. But while we have even now given a
					general description of these various branches, yet a detailed and particular
					account of them, though useful for the practice of the industries, would be
					illiberal as a subject of prolonged study. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There are books on these subjects by certain authors, for

					who value wealth-getting, <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for

						B.C.</note> of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, which is a
					device for the business of getting wealth, but which, though it is attributed to
					him because of his wisdom, is really of universal application. Thales, so the
					story goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of
					philosophy; but from his knowledge of astronomy he had observed while it was
					still winter that there was going to be a large crop of olives, so he raised a
					small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in
						<placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Chios City">Chios</placeName>, which he hired at a low rent as nobody
					was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a
					number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he
					liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for
					philosophers to be rich if they choose, but this is not what they care about.
						<milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thales then is reported to have
					thus displayed his wisdom, but as<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>a
					matter of fact this device of taking an opportunity to secure a monopoly is a
					universal principle of business; hence even some states have recourse to this
					plan as a method of raising revenue when short of funds: they introduce a
					monopoly of marketable goods. <milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There
					was a man in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> who used a sum of
					money deposited with him to buy up all the iron from the iron mines, and
					afterwards when the dealers came from the trading-centers he was the only
					seller, though he did not greatly raise the price, but all the same he made a
					profit of a hundred talents<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The talent was
						about 240 pounds.</note> on his capital of fifty. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>When Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Dionysius the elder, tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>

					means of profit detrimental to the tyrant's own affairs. Yet really this device
					is the same as the discovery of Thales, for both men alike contrived to secure
					themselves a monopoly. An acquaintance with these devices is also serviceable
					for statesmen, for many states need financial aid and modes of revenue like
					those described, just as a household may, but in greater degree; hence some
					statesmen even devote their political activity exclusively to finance.
						<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since, as we saw,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">2 init.</note> the science of household
					management has three divisions, one the relation of master to slave, of which we
					have spoken before,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">3 fin., 4.</note> one the
					paternal relation, and the third the conjugal<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The construction of the sentence is interrupted, and never
						completed.</note>&mdash;for it is a part of the household science to
					rule over wife and children <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;over both as over freemen, yet not with the same mode of government,
					but over the wife to exercise republican government and over the children
					monarchical&rpar;; <milestone n="1259b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the male is by nature better fitted to command
					than the female &lpar;except in some cases where their union has been formed
					contrary to nature&rpar; and the older and fully developed person than the
					younger and immature. It is true that in most cases of republican government the
					ruler and the ruled interchange in turn &lpar;for they tend to be on in
					equal level in their nature and to have no difference at all&rpar;, although
					nevertheless during the period when one is ruler and the other ruled they seek
					to have a distinction by means of insignia and titles and honors, just as Amasis
					made his speech about the foot-bath<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hdt. 1.172">Hdt. 1.172</bibl>. Amasis king of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> was despised by his subjects for his
						low birth, so he had a statue made out of a gold foot-bath and set it up for
						them to worship, afterwards explaining to them its lowly origin.</note>; but
					the male stands in this relationship to the female continuously. The rule of the
					father over the children on the other hand is that of a king; for the male
					parent is the ruler in virtue both of affection and of seniority, which is
					characteristic of royal government &lpar;and therefore Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.544">Hom. Il.
						1.544</bibl>.</note> finely designated Zeus by the words <quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">father of men and gods,</l>
					</quote> as the king of them all&rpar;. For though in nature the king must
					be superior, in race he should be the same as his subjects, and this is the
					position of the elder in relation to the younger and of the father in relation
					to the child. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear then that
					household management takes more interest in the human members of the household
					than in its inanimate property, and<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in
					the excellence of these than in that of its property, which we style riches, and
					more in that of its free members than in that of slaves.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>First of all then as to slaves the difficulty might be raised,
					does a slave possess any other excellence, besides his merits as a tool and a
					servant, more valuable than these, for instance temperance, have the courage,
					justice and any of the other moral virtues, or has he no excellence beside his
					bodily service? For either way there is difficulty; if slaves do possess moral
					virtue, wherein will they differ from freemen? or if they do not, this is
					strange, as they are human beings and participate in reason. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And nearly the same is the question also raised
					about the woman and the child: have they too virtues, and ought a woman to be
					temperate, brave and just, and can a child be intemperate or temperate, or not?
					This point therefore requires general consideration in relation to natural ruler
					and subject: is virtue the same for ruler and ruled, or different? If it is
					proper for both to partake in nobility of character, how could it be proper for
					the one to rule and the other to be ruled unconditionally? we cannot say that
					the difference is to be one of degree, for ruling and being ruled differ in
					kind, and difference of degree is not a difference in kind at all. <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Whereas if on the contrary it is proper for
					the one to have moral nobility but not for the other, this is surprising. For if
					the ruler is not temperate and just, how will he rule well? And if the ruled,
					how will he obey well? <milestone n="1260a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>If intemperate and cowardly he will not perform any
					of the duties of his position. It is evident therefore that both must possess
					virtue, but that there are differences in their virtue &lpar;as also there
					are differences between those who are by nature ruled&rpar;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause seems to have been interpolated;
						one ms. has a marginal correction, &lsquo;by nature rulers and
						ruled.&rsquo;</note> And of this we straightway find an indication in
					connection with the soul; for the soul by nature contains a part that rules and
					a part that is ruled, to which we assign different virtues, that is, the virtue
					of the rational and that of the irrational. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear then that the case is the same also with the
					other instances of ruler and ruled. Hence there are by nature various classes of
					rulers and ruled. For the free rules the slave, the male the female, and the man
					the child in a different way. And all possess the various parts of the soul, but
					possess them in different ways; for the slave has not got the deliberative part
					at all, and the female has it, but without full authority, while the child has
					it, but in an undeveloped form. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the mss. this sentence follows
						the next one, &lsquo;We must suppose&mdash;function,&rsquo; and
						begins &lsquo;Hence the ruler must possess <emph>moral</emph>
						virtue.&rsquo;</note> the ruler must possess intellectual virtue in
					completeness &lpar;for any work, taken absolutely, belongs to the
					master-craftsman, and rational principle is a master-craftsman&rpar;; while
					each of the other parties must have that share of this virtue which is
					appropriate to them. We must suppose therefore that the same necessarily holds
					good of the moral virtues: all must partake of them, but not in the same way,
					but in such measure as is proper to each in relation to his own
						function.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it is manifest that all the persons mentioned
					have a moral virtue of their own, and that the temperance of a woman and that of
					a man are not the same, nor their courage and justice, as Socrates thought,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Meno 74b">Plat. Meno 74bff.</bibl>
					</note> but the one is the courage of command, and the other that of
					subordination, and the case is similar with the other virtues. And this is also
					clear when we examine the matter more in detail, for it is misleading to give a
					general definition of virtue, as some do, who say that virtue is being in good
					condition as regards the soul or acting uprightly or the like; those who
					enumerate the virtues of different persons separately, as Gorgias does,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in
							Plato, <title>Meno</title> &lpar;see 7 above&rpar;,
						where this sophist figures as a character in the dialogue; see also 3.1.9,
						note.</note> are much more correct than those who define virtue in that way.
					Hence we must hold that all of these persons have their appropriate virtues, as
					the poet said of woman: <quote type="verse">
						<l met="iambic">Silence gives grace to woman<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
								<bibl n="Soph. Aj. 293">Soph. Aj. 293</bibl>
							</note>&mdash;</l>
					</quote> though that is not the case likewise with a man. <milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the child is not completely developed, so that
					manifestly his virtue also is not personal to himself, but relative to the fully
					developed being, that is, the person in authority over him. And similarly the
					slave's virtue also is in relation to the master.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And we laid it down that the slave is serviceable for the mere necessaries of
					life, so that clearly he needs only a small amount of virtue, in fact just
					enough to prevent him from failing in his tasks owing to intemperance and
					cowardice. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;But the
					question might be raised, supposing that what has just been said is true, will
					artisans also need to have virtue? for they frequently fall short in their tasks
					owing to intemperance. Or is their case entirely different? For the slave is a
					partner in his master's life, but the artisan is more remote, and only so much
					of virtue falls to his share as of slavery<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. his excellences as an artisan are the qualities of a subordinate
						&lpar;his virtues as a human being, apart from his trade, are not
						considered&rpar;.</note>&mdash; <milestone n="1260b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the mechanic artisan is
					under a sort of limited slavery, and whereas the slave is one of the natural
					classes, no shoemaker or other craftsman belongs to his trade by
					nature.&rpar; <milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is manifest
					therefore that the master ought to be the cause to the slave of the virtue
					proper to a slave, but not as possessing that art of mastership which teaches a
					slave his tasks. Hence those persons are mistaken who deprive the slave of
					reasoning and tell us to use command only; for admonition is more properly
					employed with slaves than with children.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But on
					these subjects let us conclude our decisions in this manner; while the question
					of the virtue severally belonging to man and woman and children and father, and
					of the right and wrong mode of conducting their mutual intercourse and the
					proper way of pursuing the good mode and avoiding the bad one, are matters that
					it will be necessary to follow up in the part of our treatise dealing with the
					various forms of constitution.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As a matter of
						fact in Books 7, 8 dealing with the best constitution this subject is not
						reached.</note>
					<milestone n="5.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For since every household is part
					of a state, and these relationships are part of the household, and the
					excellence of the part must have regard to that of the whole, it is necessary
					that the education both of the children and of the women should be carried on
					with a regard to the form of the constitution, if it makes any difference as
					regards the goodness of the state for the children and the women to be good. And
					it must necessarily make a difference; for the women are a half of the free
					population, and the children<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>grow up
					to be the partners in the government of the state. So that as these questions
					have been decided, and those that remain must be discussed elsewhere, let us
					relinquish the present subjects as completed, and make a fresh start in our
					discourse, and first let us consider those thinkers who have advanced views
					about the Ideal State.</p>
			</div1>
			<div1 n="2" type="Book">
				<p><milestone n="1260b" unit="section"/><milestone n="27" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since we take for our special consideration the study of the form of
					political community that is the best of all the forms for a people able to
					pursue the most ideal mode of life, we must also examine the other constitutions
					actually employed by certain of the states said to be well governed, as well as
					any others propounded by certain thinkers and reputed to be of merit, in order
					that we may discern what there is in them that is right and expedient, and also
					in order that it may not be thought that to seek for something different from
					them springs entirely from a desire to display ingenuity, but that we may be
					thought to enter upon this inquiry because these forms of constitution that
					already exist are not satisfactory. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We must first adopt as a starting-point
					that which is the natural point of departure for this inquiry. There are three
					possible systems of property: either all the citizens must own everything in
					common, or they must own nothing in common, or some things must be common
					property and others not. To have nothing in common is clearly impossible for the
					state is essentially a form of community, and to begin with there is bound to be
					a common locality: a single city occupies a single site, and the single city
					belongs to its citizens in common. <milestone n="1261a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But is it better for a city that
					is to be well ordered to have community in everything which can possibly be made
					common property, or is it better to have some things in common and others not?
					For example, it is possible for the citizens to have children, wives and
					possessions in common with each other, as in Plato's <title>Republic</title>, in
					which Socrates says that there must be
					community of children, women and possessions. Well then, which is preferable,
					the system that now obtains, or one conforming with the regulation described in
					the <title>Republic</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">On the following
						criticisms see Grote, <title>Plato</title>, 3, pp. 211-233.</note>?
						<milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now for all the citizens to have their wives in common involves a variety of
					difficulties; in particular,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lpar;1&rpar; 1.3-7; &lpar;2&rpar; 1.8-2.11;
						&lpar;3&rpar; 2.11-13; also &lpar;4&rpar; other objections
						2.15-16.</note> &lpar;1&rpar; the object which
						Socrates advances as the reason why this
					enactment should be made clearly does not follow from his arguments; also
					&lpar;2&rpar; as a means to the end which he asserts should be the
					fundamental object of the city, the scheme as actually set forth in the dialogue
					is not practicable; yet &lpar;3&rpar; how it is to be further worked out
					has been nowhere definitely stated. I refer to the ideal of the fullest possible
					unity of the entire state, which
						Socrates takes as his fundamental principle. <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Yet it is clear that
					if the process of unification advances beyond a certain point, the city will not
					be a city at all for a state essentially consists of a multitude of persons, and
					if its unification is carried beyond a certain point, city will be reduced to
					family and family to individual,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for
					we should pronounce the family to be a more complete unity than the city, and
					the single person than the family; so that even if any lawgiver were able to
					unify the state, he must not do so, for he will destroy it in the process. And
					not only does a city consist of a multitude of human beings, it consists of
					human beings differing in kind. A collection of persons all alike does not
					constitute a state. For a city is not the same thing as a league; a league is of
					value by its quantity, even though it is art the same in kind &lpar;since
					the essential object of the league is military strength&rpar;, just as a
					weight would be worth more if it weighed more, whereas<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In the mss. of the Greek
						&lsquo;whereas&mdash;kind&rsquo; comes below after
							&lsquo;
						Arcadian.&rsquo;</note> components which are to make up a
					unity must differ in kind <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;and it is by this characteristic that a city will also surpass a
					tribe of which the population is not scattered among villages but organized like
					the Arcadians&rpar;. Hence reciprocal equality<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As the best state consists of different classes, its unity is
						secured by each citizen giving services to society and receiving in return
						benefits proportionate to his service. Probably <foreign lang="greek">to\
							i)/son</foreign> is an interpolation &lpar;though
							Newman explains it as 'the reciprocal
						rendering of an equal amount of dissimilar things'&rpar;: omitting
							<foreign lang="greek">to\ i)/son</foreign>, we render
						&lsquo;reciprocity&rsquo; and not &lsquo;reciprocal
						equality&rsquo;; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1132b">Aristot. Nic.
							Eth. 1132b 33</bibl>, &lsquo;In the interchange of services Justice
						in the form of Reciprocity is the bond that maintains the association:
						reciprocity, that is, on the basis of proportion, not on the basis of
						equality.&rsquo;</note> is the preservative of states, as has been said
					before in the <title>Ethics</title>. For even among the free and equal this
					principle must necessarily obtain, since all cannot govern at once: they must
					hold office for a year at a time or by some other arrangement or period; and in
					this manner it does actually come about that all govern, just as all shoemakers
					would be also carpenters if the shoemakers and the carpenters kept on changing
					trades instead of the same persons being shoemakers and carpenters always.
						<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But since such permanence of
					function is better for the political community also, it is clear that it is
					better for the same persons to govern always, if possible; and among peoples
					where it is impossible because all the citizens are equal in their nature,
						<milestone n="1261b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>yet at the same time it is only just, whether governing is a
					good thing or a bad, that all should partake in it, and for equals thus to
					submit to authority in turn imitates their being originally dissimilar<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The best form of constitution is where there
						is a superior class that governs continuously&mdash;an aristocracy; so
						where there are no class-distinctions, the next best thing is for all the
						citizens to take turns in governing and being governed, those in office for
						the time being forming a sort of aristocracy.
						Richards's alteration of the text gives &lsquo;to take
						turns to govern is an imitation of original inequality and
						class-distinction.&lsquo;</note>; for some govern and others are
					governed by turn, as though becoming other persons; and also similarly when they
					hold office the holders of different offices are different persons. <milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear then from these considerations
					that it is not an outcome of nature for the state to be a unity in the manner in
					which certain persons say that it is, and that what has been said to be the
					greatest good in states really destroys states; yet surely a thing's particular
					good acts as its preservative.&mdash;Another line of consideration also
					shows that to seek to unify the state excessively is not beneficial. In point of
					self-sufficiency the individual is surpassed by the family and the family by the
					state, and in principle a state is fully realized only when it comes to pass
					that the community of numbers is self-sufficing; if therefore the more
					self-sufficing a community is, the more desirable is its condition, then a less
					degree of unity is more desirable than a greater. <milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, even granting that
					it is best for the community to be as complete a unity as possible, complete
					unity does not seem to be proved by the formula &lsquo;if all the citizens
					say &ldquo;Mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not mine&rdquo; at the same
					time,&rsquo; which Socrates<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The reference is to <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 462c">Plat. Rep. 462c</bibl>. Unity is secured when everyone thinks that
						everything belongs equally to him and to everybody else, i.e. everything is
						common property.</note> thinks to be a sign of the<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>city's being completely one.
					&lsquo;All&rsquo; is an ambiguous term. If it means &lsquo;each
					severally,&rsquo; very likely this would more fully realize the state of
					things which Socrates wishes to produce
					&lpar;for in that case every citizen will call the same boy his son and also
					the same woman his wife, and will speak in the same way of property and indeed
					of each of the accessories of life&rpar; <milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but <emph>ex hypothesi</emph> the citizens, having
					community of women and children, will not call them &lsquo;theirs&rsquo;
					in this sense, but will mean theirs collectively and not severally, and
					similarly they will call property &lsquo;theirs&rsquo; meaning the
					property of them all, not of each of them severally. We see then that the phrase
					&lsquo;all say&rsquo; is equivocal &lpar;in fact the words
					&lsquo;all,&rsquo; &lsquo;both,&rsquo;
					&lsquo;odd,&rsquo; &lsquo;even,&rsquo; owing to their ambiguity,
					occasion argumentative quibbling even in philosophical discussions&rpar;;
					hence really for all to say the same thing is in one sense admirable, although
					impracticable, but in another sense is not at all a sign of concord. <milestone n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And furthermore, the proposal has another
					disadvantage. Property that is common to the greatest number of owners receives
					the least attention; men care most for their private possessions, and for what
					they own in common less, or only so far as it falls to their own individual
					share for in addition to the other reasons, they think less of it on the ground
					that someone else is thinking about it, just as in household service a large
					number of domestics sometimes give worse attendance than a smaller number.
						<milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it results in each
					citizen's having a thousand sons, and these do not belong to them as individuals
					but any child is equally the son of anyone, so that all alike will regard them
					with indifference. <milestone n="1262a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, each speaks
					of one of his fellow-citizens who is prospering or getting on badly as
					&lsquo;my son&rsquo; only in the sense of the fractional part which he
					forms of the whole number&mdash;that is, he says &lsquo;my
					son&rsquo; or &lsquo;so-and-so's son,&rsquo; specifying as the
					father any individual of the thousand citizens or whatever the number be of
					which the state consists, and even this dubiously, for it is uncertain who has
					chanced to have had a son born to him and when born safely reared. <milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet which is the better way to use the
					word &lsquo;mine&rsquo;&mdash;this way, each of two thousand or ten
					thousand people applying it to the same thing, or rather the way in which they
					say &lsquo;mine&rsquo; in the actual states now? for the same person is
					called &lsquo;my son&rsquo; by one man and &lsquo;my
					brother&rsquo; by another, and another calls him
					&lsquo;nephew,&rsquo; or by some other relationship, whether of blood or
					by affinity and marriage, the speaker's own in the first place, or that of his
					relations; and in addition someone else calls him
					&lsquo;fellow-clansman&rsquo; or &lsquo;fellow-tribesman.&rsquo;
					For it is better for a boy to be one's own private nephew than one's son in the
					way described. <milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover it would
					also be impossible to avoid men's supposing certain persons to be their real
					brothers and sons and fathers and mothers; for they would be bound to form their
					belief about each other by the resemblances which occur between children and
					parents. This indeed is said by some of those who write of travels round the
						world<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Books of geography, founded on
						travellers' reports&mdash;a famous one by Hecataeus, scoffed at by <bibl n="Hdt. 4.36">Hdt. 4.36</bibl>.</note> actually to occur;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they say that some of the people of Upper
					Libya have their wives in common, yet the children born are divided among them
					according to their personal resemblances. And there are some females both of the
					human race and of the other animals, for instance horses and cattle, who have a
					strong natural tendency to produce off-spring resembling the male parents, as
					was the case with the mare at <placeName key="perseus,Pharsalos">Pharsalus</placeName>
					named Honest Lady.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly

					<milestone n="1.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover it is not easy for those who institute this communism to guard
					against such objectionable occurrences as outrage, involuntary and in some cases
					voluntary homicide, fights, abusive language; all of which are violations of
					piety when committed against fathers, mothers and near relatives as if they were
					not relatives; but these are bound to occur more frequently when people do not
					know their relations than when they do, and also, when they do occur, if the
					offenders know their relationship it is possible for them to have the customary
					expiations performed, but for those who do not no expiation is possible.
						<milestone n="1.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also it is curious that a
					theorist who makes the sons common property only debars lovers from intercourse
					and does not prohibit love, nor the other familiarities, which between father
					and son or brother and brother are most unseemly, since even the fact of love
					between them is unseemly. And it is also strange that he deprives them of
					intercourse for no other reason except because the pleasure is too violent; and
					that he thinks it makes no difference that the parties are in the one case
					father or son and in the other case brothers of one another. And it seems that
					this community of wives and sons is more serviceable for the Farmer class than
					for the Guardians; <milestone n="1262b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for there will be less friendship among them if
					their children and women are in common, and unfriendliness in the subject
					classes is a good thing with a view to their being submissive to authority and
					not making revolution. <milestone n="1.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But speaking
					generally such a law is bound to bring about the opposite state of things to
					that which rightly enacted laws ought properly to cause, and because of which
						Socrates thinks it necessary to
					make these regulations about the children and women. For we think that
					friendship is the greatest of blessings for the state, since it is the best
					safeguard against revolution, and the unity of the state, which
					Socrates praises most highly, both appears to
					be and is said by him to be the effect of friendship, just as we know that
						Aristophanes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The comic poet, figuring as
						a character in Plato's
							<title>Symposium,</title> see especially <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 192c">Plat.
							Sym. 192c ff.</bibl>.</note> in the discourses on love describes how the
					lovers owing to their extreme affection desire to grow together and both become
					one instead of being two. <milestone n="1.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In such a
					union it would be inevitable that both would be spoiled, or at least one, and in
					the state friendship would inevitably become watery in consequence of such
					association, and the expressions &lsquo;my father&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;my son&rsquo; would quite go out. For just as putting a little
					sugar into a quantity of water makes the mixture imperceptible, so it also must
					come about that the mutual relationship based on these names must become
						imperceptible,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since in the
					republic described by Plato there will
					be the least possible necessity for people to care for one another as father for
					sons or as son for father or as brother for brother. For there are two things
					that most cause men to care for and to love each other, the sense of ownership
					and the sense of preciousness; and neither motive can be present with the
					citizens of a state so constituted. <milestone n="1.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, as to the transference of some of the children at birth from the
					Farmers and Artisans to the Guardians<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						three classes in Plato's <title>Republic</title>.</note> and of others from
					the Guardians to the Farmers and Artisans, there is much confusion as to how it
					is to be done; and the parents who give the children and the officials who
					transfer them are bound to know which they give to whom. And again, the things
					spoken of above are bound to occur even more with these transferred children,
					such as outrage, love-making and murder; for the children of the Guardians
					transferred to the other citizens will no longer speak of the Guardians as
					brothers and children and fathers and mothers, nor yet will those living among
					the Guardians so speak of the other classes, so as to be careful not to commit
					any such offence because of their relationship.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such therefore may be our decision as to community of children and women.
						<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In connection with this we have to consider the due regulation of property in
					a community that is to have the best political institutions: should property be
					owned in common or privately? This question might indeed be considered
					separately from the system laid down by law with regard to the children and the
					women: <milestone n="1263a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>I mean, even if there be separate families as is now the case
					with all nations, is it better for both the ownership and the employment of
					property to be in common. . . ,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Something has
						clearly been lost here, signifying &lsquo;or should there be some
						limited form of communism?&rsquo;</note> for example, should the farms
					be separate property but the farm-produce be brought into the common stock for
					consumption &lpar;as is the practice with some non-Greek races&rpar;; or
					on the contrary should the land be common and farmed in common, but the produce
					be divided for private use &lpar;and this form of communism also is said to
					prevail among some of the barbarians&rpar;; or should both farms and produce
					be common property? <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if the
					tillers of the soil be of a different class<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. a class of serfs, like the Helots at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</note> there might be another and easier system,
					but if the citizens do the work for themselves, the regulations for the common
					ownership of property would give more causes for discontent; for if both in the
					enjoyment of the produce and in the work of production they prove not equal but
					unequal, complaints are bound to arise between those who enjoy or take much but
					work little and those who take less but work more. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general to live together and share all our human
					affairs is difficult, and especially to share such things as these. And this is
					shown in the partnerships of fellow-travellers, for almost the greatest number
					of them quarrel because they come into collision with one another as a result of
					ordinary matters and trifles; and also we come into collision most with those of
					our servants<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>whom we employ most often
					for ordinary attendance. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Community
					of property therefore involves these and other similar difficulties; and the
					present system, if further improved by good morals and by the regulation of
					correct legislation, would be greatly superior. For it will possess the merit of
					both systems, by which I mean the advantage of property being common and the
					advantage of its being private. For property ought to be common in a sense but
					private speaking absolutely. For the superintendence of properties being divided
					among the owners will not cause these mutual complaints, and will improve the
					more because each will apply himself to it as to private business of his own;
					while on the other hand virtue will be exercised to make &lsquo;friends'
					goods common goods,&rsquo; as the proverb<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The saying was ascribed to Pythgagoras.</note> goes, for the purpose of
					use. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such a system exists even now
					in outline in some states, showing that it is not impracticable, and especially
					in the ones that are well-administered parts of it are realized already and
					parts might be realized; for individuals while owning their property privately
					put their own possessions at the service of their friends and make use of their
					friends' possessions as common property; for instance in <placeName key="tperseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> people use one another's slaves as
					virtually their own, as well as horses and hounds, and also use the produce in
					the fields throughout the country if they need provisions on a journey. It is
					clear therefore that it is better for possessions to be privately owned, but to
					make them common property in use; and to train the citizens to this is the
					special task of the legislator. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					moreover to feel that a thing is one's private property makes an inexpressibly
					great difference for pleasure; for the universal feeling of love for oneself is
					surely not purposeless, but a natural instinct. <milestone n="1263b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Selfishness on the
					other hand is justly blamed; but this is not to love oneself but to love oneself
					more than one ought, just as covetousness means loving money to
					excess&mdash;since some love of self, money and so on is practically
					universal. Moreover, to bestow favors and assistance on friends or visitors or
					comrades is a great pleasure, and a condition of this is the private ownership
					of property. <milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These advantages
					therefore do not come to those who carry the unification of the state too far;
					and in addition to this they manifestly do away with the practice of two
					virtues, temperance in relation to women &lpar;for it is a noble deed to
					refrain from one through temperance when she belongs to another&rpar; and
					liberality in relation to possessions &lpar;for one will not be able to
					display liberality nor perform a single liberal action, since the active
					exercise of liberality takes place in the use of
						possessions&rpar;.<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such legislation therefore has an attractive appearance,
					and might be thought to be humane; for he who is told about it welcomes it with
					gladness, thinking that it will result in a marvellous friendliness of everybody
					towards everybody, especially when somebody denounces the evils at present
					existing in states as due to the fact that<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>wealth is not owned in common&mdash; I mean lawsuits
					between citizens about breach of contract, and trials for perjury, and the
					flattery of the rich. <milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the real
					cause of all these evils is not the absence of communism, but wickedness, since
					we see far more quarrels occurring among those who own or use property in common
					than among those who have their estates separate; but we notice that those who
					quarrel as a result of their partnerships are few when compared with the total
					number of private owners. And again it is just to state not only all the evils
					that men will lose by adopting communism, but also all the good things; and life
					in such circumstances is seen to be utterly impossible. The cause of
					Socrates' error must be deemed to be that his
					fundamental assumption was incorrect. It is certain that in a way both the
					household and the state should be a unit, but they should not be so in every
					way. For in one way the state as its unification proceeds will cease to be a
					state, and in another way, though it continues a state, yet by coming near to
					ceasing to be one it will be a worse state, just as if one turned a harmony into
					unison or a rhythm into a single foot. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The proper thing is for the state, while being a
					multitude, to be made a partnership and a unity by means of education, as has
					been said before and it is strange that the very philosopher who intends to
					introduce a system of education and thinks that this will make the city morally
					good should fancy that he can regulate society by such measures as have been
					mentioned instead of by manners and culture and laws, just as the legislator
					introduced community of property in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> by
					the institution of public messes. <milestone n="1264a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And this very point also must
					not be ignored, that attention must be paid to length of time and to the long
					period of years, in which it would not have escaped notice if these measures
					were good ones; for nearly all of them have been discovered already, although
					some of them have not been collected together and others though brought to
					knowledge are not put into practice. <milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And their value would become most manifest if one could see such a
					constitution in actual process of formation; for one will only be able to
					construct Plato's state by introducing its partitions and dividing up the
					community into common messes and also into brotherhoods and tribes. So that in
					the upshot no other regulation will have been enacted except the exemption of
					the Guardians from the work of agriculture, which is a measure that even now the
					Spartans attempt to introduce.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover, the
					working of the constitution as a whole in regard to the members of the state has
					also not been described by Socrates,
					nor is it easy to say what it will be. Yet the general mass of the citizens of
					the other classes make almost the bulk of the state, and about these no definite
					regulations are laid down, as to whether the Farmers also are to have their
					property in common or to hold it in private ownership, and also whether
					community of wives and children is to apply to them or not. <milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if the Farmers are to have the same complete
					communism, what will be the difference between them and the Guardian class? or
					what advantage will they gain by submitting to their government? or what
					consideration will induce them to submit to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the government, unless the Guardians adopt some clever device
					like that of the Cretans? These have conceded to their slaves all the same
					rights as they have themselves except that they are forbidden gymnastic
					exercises and the possession of arms. But if the family life and property of the
					Farmers are to be such as they are in other states, what sort of communism will
					there be? For there will inevitably be two states in one, and these antagonistic
					to one another. For Socrates makes the
					Guardians a sort of garrison, while the Farmers, Artisans and other classes are
					the citizens.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lpar;omitting <foreign lang="greek">tou\s</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">texni/tas</foreign>&rpar; &lsquo;For
							Socrates makes one set of men guardians, a
						sort of garrison, and another set farmers and artisans and citizens of the
						other sorts.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But quarrels and lawsuits and all
					the other evils which according to
					Socrates exist in actual states will all be found among his
					citizens too. Yet he says that owing to their education they will not need many
					regulations such as city and market by-laws and the other regulations of that
					sort, although he assigns his education only to the Guardians. Again, he makes
					the Farmers the masters of the estates, for which they pay rent; but they are
					likely to be far more unmanageable and rebellious than the classes of helots,
					serfs and slaves in certain states today. <milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, whether this communism is to be compulsory for
					the Farmers in the same way as for the Guardians or whether it is not, has as a
					matter of fact not been definitely stated anywhere, nor is there any information
					about the connected questions, what are to be the political functions and the
					education of the lower classes, and the laws affecting them. But it is not easy
					to discover the answers to these questions, yet the character of the lower
					classes is of no small importance for the preservation of the community of the
					Guardians. <milestone n="1264b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But again, if Socrates
					intends to make the Farmers have their wives in common but their property
					private, who is to manage the household in the way in which the women's husbands
					will carry on the work of the farms? And if the property and the wives of the
					Farmers are to be common . . . <note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A passage has
						been lost here.</note>
					<milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It
					is also strange that Socrates employs
					the comparison of the lower animals to show that the women are to have the same
					occupations as the men, considering that animals have no households to manage.
					Also Socrates' method of appointing the
					magistrates is not a safe one. For he makes the same persons hold office always;
					but this occasions rebellion even among people of no special distinction, much
					more so then among high-spirited and warlike men. But it is clear that he is
					compelled to make the same persons govern always, for the god-given admixture of
					gold in the soul is not bestowed on some at one time and others at another time,
					but is always in the same men, and
					Socrates says that at the moment of birth some men receive an
					admixture of gold and others of silver and those who are to be the Artisans and
					Farmers an admixture of copper and iron. <milestone n="2.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again, although he deprives the Guardians of
					happiness, he says that it is the duty of the law-giver to make the whole city
					happy. But it is not possible for the whole to be happy unless most or all of
					its parts, or some of them, possess happiness. For happiness is not a thing of
					the same sort<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as being an even number:
					that may belong to a whole but not to either of its parts, but happiness cannot
					belong to the whole and not to its parts. But yet, if the Guardians are not
					happy, what other class is? For clearly the Artisans and the general mass of the
					vulgar classes are not.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The Republic discussed by
						Socrates therefore possesses these
					difficulties and also others not smaller than these.<milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And almost the same holds
					good of the <title>Laws</title> also, which was written later, so that it will
					be advantageous to make some small examination of the constitution described in
					that book as well. For in the <title>Republic</title>
					Socrates has laid down details about
					very few matters&mdash;regulations about community of wives and children and
					about property, and the structure of the constitution &lpar;for the mass of
					the population is divided into two parts, one forming the Farmer class and the
					other the class that defends the state in war, and there is a third class drawn
					from these latter that forms the council and governs the state&rpar;, but
					about the Farmers and the Artisans, whether they are excluded from government or
					have some part in it, and whether these classes also are to possess arms and to
					serve in war with the others or not, on these points
					Socrates has made no decision, but though he
					thinks that the women ought to serve in war with the Guardians and share the
					same education, the rest of the discourse he has filled up with external topics,
					and about the sort of education which it is proper for the Guardians to
						have.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The last clause, &lsquo;and
						about&mdash;to have,&rsquo; has almost certainly been misplaced by a
						copyist, and should come near the beginning of the sentence, after
						&lsquo;about property.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1265a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But though the
						<title>Laws</title> consists for the most part of a treatise on law, the
					author has said a little about the form of the constitution, and in a desire to
					make this more suitable for adoption by actual states he brings it round by
					degrees back to the other form, that of the <title>Republic</title>. For except
					community in wives and property, he assigns all his other regulations in the
					same form to both states, for he prescribes for both the same scheme of
					education, and a life detached from menial tasks, and similarly as regards
					common meals, except that in the state described in the <title>Laws</title> he
					says there are to be common meals for women also, and he makes the Republic
					consist of a class possessing arms that numbers a thousand, but the state of the
						<title>Laws</title> has five thousand.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it is true that all the
					discourses of Socrates possess brilliance, cleverness, originality and keenness
					of inquiry, but it is no doubt difficult to be right about everything: for
					instance with regard to the size of population just mentioned it must not be
					over-looked that a territory as large as that of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> will be needed for so many inhabitants, or some other
					country of unlimited extent, to support five thousand men in idleness and
					another swarm of women and servants around them many times as numerous. It is
					proper no doubt to assume ideal conditions, but not to go beyond all bounds of
					possibility. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is said that in
					laying down the laws the legislator must have his attention fixed on two
						things,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the territory and the
					population. But also it would be well to add that he must take into account the
					neighboring regions also, if the city is to live a life of politics<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. a life of intercourse with other states,
						cf. 1327b 5. Some mss. add &lsquo;not one of isolation&rsquo;; this
						looks like an explanatory note interpolated.</note> &lpar;for it is
					necessary for it to use for war not only such arms as are serviceable within its
					own territory but also such as are serviceable against places outside
					it&rpar;; and if one does not accept such a description whether for the life
					of the individual or for the common life of the state, yet it is none the less
					necessary for the citizens to be formidable to their enemies not only when they
					have entered the country but also when they have left it.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give &lsquo;when
						they are away from it.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the amount of property requires
					consideration: would it not perhaps be better to define it differently, by a
					clearer formula? The writer says that it ought to be sufficiently large for the
					citizens &lsquo;to live a temperate life&rsquo;&mdash;as if one were
					to say &lsquo;to live a good life&rsquo;; but really that phrase is too
					general, since it is possible to live temperately yet miserably. But a better
					definition would be &lsquo;to live temperately and liberally&rsquo;
					&lpar;for if the two are separated a liberal mode of life is liable to slip
					into luxury and a temperate one into a life of hardship&rpar;, since surely
					these are the only desirable qualities relating to the use of
					wealth&mdash;for instance you cannot use wealth gently or bravely, but you
					can use it temperately and liberally, so that it follows that these are
					qualities that have to do with wealth. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is also strange that although equalizing properties
					the writer does not regulate the number of the citizens, but leaves the
					birth-rate uncontrolled, on the assumption that it will be sufficiently levelled
					up to the same total owing to childless marriages, however many children are
					begotten, <milestone n="1265b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because this seems to take place in the states at present. But
					this ought to be regulated much more in the supposed case than it is now, for
					now nobody is destitute, because estates are divided among any number, but then,
					as division of estates will not be allowed, the extra children will necessarily
					have nothing, whether they are fewer in number or more. <milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And one might think that restriction ought to be
					put on the birth-rate rather than on property, so as not to allow more than a
					certain number of children to be produced, and that in fixing their number
					consideration should be paid to the chances of its happening that some of the
					children born may die, and to the absence of children in the other marriages;
					but for the matter to be left alone, as it is in most states, is bound to lead
					to poverty among the citizens, and poverty produces sedition and crime. The
					Corinthian Phidon<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Otherwise unknown.</note>
					in fact, one of the most ancient lawgivers, thought that the house-holds and the
					citizen population ought to remain at the same numbers, even though at the
					outset the estates of all were unequal in size; but in Plato's
						<title>Laws</title> the opposite is the case.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the estates are equal, and the number of households
						fixed, but not the number of citizens.</note> However, we must say later
					what we think would be a better system in these matters; <milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but another question omitted in the
						<title>Laws</title> is how the rulers will be different from the classes
					ruled; the writer prescribes<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that the
					rulers are to stand in the same relation to the ruled as the warp of cloth
					stands to the woof by being made of different wool.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 734e">Plat. Laws 734e ff.</bibl> In
						weaving cloth the warp &lpar;the threads set up first&rpar; must be
						of strong wool, the woof &lpar;the threads woven across the
						warp&rpar; must be softer.</note> And inasmuch as he allows a man's
					total property to be increased up to five times its original value, for what
					reason should not an increase in his landed estate be allowed up to a certain
					point? Also it must be considered whether the proposed separation of homesteads
					is not inexpedient for household economy&mdash;for the writer allotted two
					homesteads separate from one another to each citizen; but it is difficult to
					manage two households.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The object was to
						provide a separate establishment for a married son, <bibl n="Plat. Laws 776a">Plat. Laws 776a</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="3.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the whole constitution is
					intended, it is true, to be neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but of the
					form intermediate between them which is termed a republic, for the government is
					constituted from the class that bears arms. If therefore he introduces this
					constitution as the one most commonly existing of all forms of constitution in
					the actual states, he has perhaps made a good proposal, but if he introduces it
					as the next best to the first form of constitution, it is not a good proposal;
					for very likely one might approve the Spartan constitution more highly, or
					perhaps some other form nearer to an aristocracy. <milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In fact some people assert that the best constitution must
					be a combination of all the forms of constitution, and therefore praise the
					constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> &lpar;for
					some people say that it consists of oligarchy, monarchy and democracy, meaning
					that the kingship is monarchy and the rule of the ephors oligarchy, but that an
					element of democracy is introduced by the rule of the ephors because the ephors
					come from the common people; while others pronounce the ephorate a tyranny but
					find an element of democracy in the public mess-tables and in the other
					regulations of daily life&rpar;. <milestone n="1266a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In Plato's <title>Laws</title> on the other hand it is
					stated that the best constitution must consist of a combination of democracy and
						tyranny,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Plato wrote
						&lsquo;monarchy,&rsquo; <bibl n="Plat. Laws 693d">Plat. Laws
							693d</bibl> &lpar;cf. here 3.13&rpar;.</note> which one might
					refuse to count as constitutional governments at all, or else rank as the worst
					of all constitutions. A better theory therefore is put forward by those who
					intermingle a larger number of forms, for the constitution composed of a
					combination of a larger number of forms is better. In the next place, the
					constitution in the <title>Laws</title> proves as a matter of fact not to
					contain any element of monarchy at all, but its factors are taken from oligarchy
					and democracy, and for the most part it tends to incline towards oligarchy. This
					appears from the regulations for the appointment of the magistrates; for their
					selection by lot from a list previously elected by vote is a feature common to
					both oligarchy and democracy, but the compulsion put upon the richer citizens to
					attend the assembly and vote for magistrates or perform any other political
					function, while the others are allowed to do as they like, is oligarchical, as
					is the endeavor to secure that a majority of the magistrates shall be drawn from
					the wealthy and that the highest offices shall be filled from the highest of the
					classes assessed by wealth. <milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the
					writer also makes the election of the council oligarchical for everybody is
					compelled to elect, but from the first property-class, and then again an equal
					number from the second class, and then from the members of the third class,
					except that it was not to be compulsory for all to vote for those to be elected
					from the members of the third or the fourth class, and to elect from the fourth
					class was only compulsory for the members of the first and second classes; and
					afterwards from those thus selected he says that they are to appoint<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>an equal number from each class. Thus those
					who elect the members from the highest property classes will be more numerous
					and better,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. a better ellective body
						because representative of all classes.</note> because some of the lower
					orders will abstain from voting<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. from
						voting for the preliminary list from the third and fourth classes.</note> as
					it is not compulsory. <milestone n="3.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Accordingly
					that it is not proper to establish a constitution of this character from a blend
					of democracy and monarchy appears clearly from these considerations, and from
					what will be said later when our inquiry comes to deal with this class of
					constitution; also the provision for the election of the rulers from among
					candidates chosen at a preliminary election is dangerous, for if even a moderate
					number of people choose to combine into a party, the elections will always go
					according to their wish.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such are the points as to
					the constitution in the <title>Laws.</title>
					<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There
					are also certain other constitutional schemes, some drawn up by amateurs and
					others by philosophers and statesmen, but all of them are nearer to those which
					have been actually established and by which states are governed at present than
					are both of those which have been considered; for nobody else has introduced the
					innovation of community of children and women, nor that of public meals for the
					women, but they start rather with the necessary reforms. For some persons think
					that the right regulation of property is the most important; for the question of
					property, they say, is universally the cause of party strife. Therefore the
					Chalcedonian Phaleas<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Otherwise
						unknown.</note> was the first who introduced this expedient; <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for he says that the citizens' estates
					ought to be equal <milestone n="1266b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and he thought that this would not be difficult to
					secure at the outset for cities in process of foundation, while in those already
					settled, although it would be a more irksome task, nevertheless a levelling
					would most easily be effected by the rich giving dowries but not receiving them
					and the poor receiving but not giving them. Plato when writing the
						<title>Laws</title> thought that up to a certain point inequality ought to
					be allowed, but that no citizen should be permitted to acquire more land than
					would make his estate five times the size of the smallest, as has also been said
						before.<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But those who bring in legislation of this sort must also not
					overlook this point, which is overlooked at present, that when regulating the
					amount of property legislators ought also to regulate the size of the family;
					for if the number of children becomes too large for the property, the law is
					quite sure to be broken, and apart from the breach of the law it is a bad thing
					that many citizens who were rich should become poor, for it is difficult for
					such men not to be advocates of a new order. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That a level standard of property affects the community of
					the citizens in an important manner some men even in old times clearly have
					recognized; for example there is the legislation of Solon, and other states have
					a law prohibiting the acquisition of land to any amount that the individual may
					desire; and similarly there is legislation to prevent the sale of estates, as at
						<placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName> there is a law<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that a man shall not sell unless he can
					prove that manifest misfortune has befallen him and also there is legislation to
					preserve the old allotments, and the repeal of this restriction at <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName> made the Leucadian constitution
					excessively democratic, for it came about that the offices were no longer filled
					from the established property-qualifications. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is possible that equality of estates may be
					maintained, but their size may be either too large and promote luxury, or too
					small, causing a penurious standard of living; it is clear therefore that it is
					not enough for the lawgiver to make the estates equal, but he must aim at
					securing a medium size. And again, even if one prescribed a moderate property
					for all, it would be of no avail, since it is more needful to level men's
					desires than their properties, and this can only be done by an adequate system
					of education enforced by law. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					perhaps Phaleas would say that he himself actually prescribes this, as he
					considers it fundamentally necessary for states to have equality in these two
					things, property and education. But the nature of the education needs to be
					defined: it is no use merely for it to be one and the same for all, for it is
					possible for all to have one and the same education but for this to be of such a
					nature as to make them desirous of getting more than their share of money or
					honor or both; <milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>moreover<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably the Greek should be altered to give
						&lsquo;because&rsquo; instead of
						&lsquo;moreover.&rsquo;</note> civil strife is caused not only by
					inequality of property but also by inequality of honors, though the two motives
					operate in opposite ways&mdash;the masses are discontented if possessions
					are unequally distributed, <milestone n="1267a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the upper classes if honors are equally

					</quote> Nor do men do wrong for the sake of the bare necessities only, the sort
					of wrongdoing for which Phaleas thinks that equality of substance is a
					cure&mdash;preventing highway robbery by removing the motive of cold or
					hunger; men also do wrong to gain pleasure and to satisfy desire. For if they
					have a desire above the bare necessities of existence, they will transgress to
					cure this desire; and moreover not because of desire only, but in order that
					they may enjoy the pleasures that are not associated with pains. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What remedy then is there for these three
					classes of offenders? For the first class, a modest competence and work; for the
					second, temperance; and as for the third sort, any people who desire pleasures
					that depend on themselves would require no cure for their desires save that
					which is derived from philosophy, for the other pleasures require the aid of
					fellow-creatures. Since clearly the greatest transgressions spring from a desire
					for superfluities, not for bare necessaries &lpar;for example, men do not
					become tyrants in order to avoid shivering with cold, and accordingly high
					honors are awarded to one who kills a tyrant, but not to one who kills a
					thief&rpar;; so that the method of the constitution of Phaleas is
					efficacious only against the minor social disorders. <milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, Phaleas desires to frame institutions for the most
					part which will lead to a right state of affairs in the internal relations of
					the citizens, but the legislator should also have regard to relations with the
					neighboring peoples and with all foreign nations.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>It is essential therefore for the constitution to be framed
					with a view to military strength, about which Phaleas has said nothing. And the
					same is true also about property; for the citizens should not only possess
					enough to meet their requirements in civic life, but also to encounter the
					perils that face them from outside; hence they should possess neither so large
					an amount of wealth that it will be coveted by their neighbors and by stronger
					states while its possessors will be unable to repel their assailants, nor yet so
					small an amount as not to be capable of sustaining a war even against equal and
					similar states. <milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Phaleas, it is
					true, has laid down no rule at all, but the question must not be overlooked,
					what amount of wealth is advantageous. Perhaps therefore the best limit to
					prescribe is that it must not profit a stronger people to make war upon the
					state because of its excessive wealth, but only just as it might do even if the
					citizens had not got so much property. For example, when Autophradates was about
					to lay siege to <placeName key="perseus,Atarneus">Atarneus</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A stronghold on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> acquired by Eubulus, a
						Bithynian banker, when the Persian empire was breaking up, middle 4th
						century B.C.; Autophradates was a Persian general.</note> Eubulus bade him
					consider how long it would take him to capture the place, and then calculate
					what his expenditure would be for that period, for he himself was willing for
					the payment of a smaller sum than that to evacuate <placeName key="perseus,Atarneus">Atarneus</placeName> at once; these words caused
					Autophradates to ponder and led him to abandon the siege. <milestone n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now equality of property among the citizens is
					certainly one of the factors that contribute to the avoidance of party faction;
					it is not however a particularly important one. For the upper classes may resent
					it on the ground that their merits are not equal, owing to which we actually see
					them often attacking the government and rebelling; <milestone n="1267b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and also the
					baseness of human beings is a thing insatiable, and though at the first a dole
					of only two obols<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Twopence-halfpenny for a
						seat in the theater at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
						paid for citizens by the State after the time of Pericles.</note> is enough,
					yet when this has now become an established custom, they always want more, until
					they get to an unlimited amount; for appetite is in its nature unlimited, and
					the majority of mankind live for the satisfaction of appetite. <milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The starting-point in such matters
					therefore, rather than levelling estates, is to train those that are respectable
					by nature so that they may not wish for excessive wealth, and to contrive that
					the base may not be able to do so, and this is secured if they are inferior in
					number and not unjustly treated. And also we cannot approve what Phaleas has
					said about equality of property, for he makes the citizens equal in respect of
					landed estate only, but wealth also consists in slaves and cattle and money, and
					there is an abundance of property in the shape of what is called furniture; we
					must therefore either seek to secure equality or some moderate regulation as
					regards all these things, or we must permit all forms of wealth. <milestone n="4.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is clear from Phaleas's legislation
					that he makes the citizen-population a small one, inasmuch as all the artisans
					are to be publicly owned slaves and are not to furnish any complement of the
					citizen-body. But if it is proper to have public slaves, the laborers employed
					upon the public works ought to be of that status &lpar;as is the case at
						<placeName key="perseus,Epidamnos">Epidamnus</placeName> and as Diophantus once
					tried to institute at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>&rpar;.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These remarks
					may serve fairly well to indicate such merits<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and defects as may be contained in the constitution of
						Phaleas.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hippodamus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A famous
						architect and town-planner &lpar;see 1330b 24&rpar; circa <date value="-475">475</date> B.C.</note> son of Euryphon, a Milesian
					&lpar;who invented the division of cities into blocks and cut up <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>, and who also became somewhat
					eccentric in his general mode of life owing to a desire for distinction, so that
					some people thought that he lived too fussily, with a quantity of hair<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> men wore their hair long, but at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> this was the mark of a
						dandy.</note> and expensive ornaments, and also a quantity of cheap yet warm
					clothes not only in winter but also in the summer periods, and who wished to be
					a man of learning in natural science generally&rpar;, was the first man not
					engaged in politics who attempted to speak on the subject of the best form of
					constitution. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>His system was for a
					city with a population of ten thousand, divided into three classes; for he made
					one class of artisans, one of farmers, and the third the class that fought for
					the state in war and was the armed class. He divided the land into three parts,
					one sacred, one public and one private: sacred land to supply the customary
					offerings to the gods, common land to provide the warrior class with food, and
					private land to be owned by the farmers. He thought that there are only three
					divisions of the law, since the matters about which lawsuits take place are
					three in number&mdash;outrage, damage, homicide. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>He also proposed to establish one supreme court of
					justice, to which were to be carried up all the cases at law thought to have
					been decided wrongly, and this court he made to consist of certain selected
					elders. <milestone n="1268a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>He held that the verdicts in the courts ought not to be given
					by ballot, but that each juryman should bring a tablet on which if he found a
					simple verdict of guilty he should write the penalty, and if simply not guilty
					leave a blank, but if he found the prisoner guilty on some counts but not on
					others he should state this; for the present state of the law he thought
					unsatisfactory, since it forces jurors to commit perjury by giving either the
					one verdict or the other. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>He
					proposed a law that those who discovered something of advantage to the state
					should receive honor, and that the children of those who died in war should have
					their maintenance from the state, in the belief that this had never yet been
					provided by law among other people&mdash;but as a matter of fact this law
					exists at present both at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and
					in others of the cities. The governing officials were all to be chosen by the
					assembly of the people, and this he made to consist of the three classes of the
					city; and the officials elected were to superintend the business of the
					community and the affairs of foreign residents and of orphans. These then are
					the greatest number and the most noteworthy of the provisions in the system of
					Hippodamus. <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But doubt might be
					raised first of all about the division of the general mass of the citizens. The
					artisans, the farmers and the military class all participate in the government,
					though the farmers have not got arms and the artisans neither arms nor
						land,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which makes them almost the
					slaves of those who possess the arms. Therefore for them to share in all the
					offices is impossible &lpar;for it is inevitable that both military
					commanders and civic guards and in general the most important offices should be
					appointed from those that have the arms&rpar;; but if they do not share in
					the government of the state, how is it possible for them to be friendly towards
					the constitution? <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it may be said
					that the ruling class as possessing the arms is bound to be stronger than both
					classes. But this is not easy if they are not numerous and if this be the case,
					why should the other classes participate in the government and control the
					appointment of the rulers?<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As military posts
						must be filled by the military class, the civilians will feel excluded and
						be disaffected; and the military class may not be strong enough to control
						them. Better, then, not to give full citizenship to civilians.</note> Again,
					what use are the farmers to the state? artisans there must necessarily be
					&lpar;for every state requires artisans&rpar;, and they can make a
					living as in the other states from the practice of their craft; but as for the
					farmers, although it would have been reasonable for them to be a portion of the
					state if they provided the class possessing the arms with its food, as it is
					they have private land of their own and farm it for themselves. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again, if the common land from which
					those who fight for the state are to have their food is to be farmed by
					themselves, the military class would not be different from the agricultural, but
					the legislator intends it to be; while if the cultivators of the common land are
					to be a different set of people from both those who cultivate the private farms
					and the soldiers, this will be yet a forth section of the state, holding no part
					in it but quite estranged from the government. But yet if one is to make those
					who cultivate the private and the common land the same people, the amount of the
					produce from the farms which each man will cultivate will be scanty for two
					households, <milestone n="1268b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and moreover why are they not both to take food for themselves
					and to supply it to the soldiers direct from the land and from the same
					allotments? <milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All these points
					therefore involve much confusion. Also the law about trials is
					unsatisfactory&mdash;the requirement that the verdict shall be given on
					separate counts when the charge in the indictment is single, and the conversion
					of the juror into an arbitrator. A qualified verdict is practicable in an
					arbitration even when there are several arbitrators &lpar;for they confer
					with one another about their verdict&rpar;, but it is not practicable in the
					law-courts, but the contrary to this is actually provided for by most lawgivers,
					who prohibit consultation between the jurymen. <milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then the verdict will inevitably be a confused one when
					the juror thinks that the defendant is liable for damages but not in so large an
					amount as the plaintiff claims; for the plaintiff will sue for twenty minae<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The mina, 100 drachmas, may be put at 4 pounds
						&lpar;gold&rpar;.</note> and the juror will adjudge ten minae
					&lpar;or the former some larger and the latter some smaller sum&rpar;,
					and another juror five minae, and yet another four &lpar;and so they will
					obviously go on making fractions&rpar;, while others will award the whole
					sum, and others nothing; what then will be the method of counting the votes?
					Again, nobody compels the juror to commit perjury who, if the indictment has
					been drawn in simple form, gives a simple verdict of acquittal or condemnation,
					and gives it justly; for the juror<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>who
					gives a verdict of acquittal does not give judgement that the defendant owes
					nothing, but that he does not owe the twenty minae for which he is sued; it is
					only the juror who gives a verdict condemning the defendant when he does not
					think that he owes twenty minae who commits perjury. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for the view that an honor ought to be awarded to those
					who invent something advantageous to the state, legislation to this effect is
					not safe, but only specious to the ear; for it involves malicious prosecutions
					and, it may even happen, constitutional upheavals. And the matter leads to
					another problem and a different inquiry: some persons raise the question whether
					to alter the ancestral laws, supposing another law is better, is harmful or
					advantageous to states. Hence it is not easy to give a speedy agreement to the
					above proposal to honor reformers, if really it is disadvantageous to alter the
					laws; yet it is possible that persons may bring forward the repeal of laws or of
					the constitution as a benefit to the community. <milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we have made mention of this question, it will
					be better if we set out a few further observations about it, for, as we said, it
					involves difficulty. And it might be thought that it would be better for
					alteration to take place; at all events in the other fields of knowledge this
					has proved beneficial&mdash;for example, medicine has been improved by being
					altered from the ancestral system, and gymnastic training, and in general all
					the arts and faculties so that since statesmanship also is to be counted as one
					of these, it is clear that the same thing necessarily holds good in regard to it
					as well. And it might be said that a sign of this has occurred in the actual
					events of history, for &lpar;one might argue&rpar; the laws of ancient
					times were too simple and uncivilized: the Hellenes, for instance, used both to
					carry arms and to purchase their wives from one another, <milestone n="5.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and all the survivals of the customs of antiquity
					existing anywhere are utterly foolish, <milestone n="1269a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as for example at Cyme there is
					a law relating to trials for murder, that if the prosecutor on the charge of
					murder produces a certain number of his own relatives as witnesses, the
					defendant is guilty of the murder. And in general all men really seek what is
					good, not what was customary with their forefathers; and it is probable that
					primitive mankind, whether sprung from the earth<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">So <bibl n="Hes. WD 108">Hes. WD 108</bibl>, <bibl n="Pind. N. 6">Pind. N. 6.1</bibl>.</note> or the survivors of some
					destructive cataclysm,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">So <bibl n="Plat. Laws 676">Plat. Laws 676 ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 22">Plat. Tim. 22 ff.</bibl> Aristotle believed that man had existed for
						ever, and that the world had experienced only local cataclysms.</note> were
					just like ordinary foolish people, as indeed is actually said of the earth-born
					race, so that it is odd that we should abide by their notions. Moreover even
					written codes of law may with advantage not be left unaltered. For just as in
					the other arts as well, so with the structure of the state it is impossible that
					it should have been framed aright in all its details; for it must of necessity
					be couched in general terms, but our actions deal with particular things. These
					considerations therefore make it clear that it is proper for some laws sometimes
					to be altered. <milestone n="5.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if we consider
					the matter in another way, it would seem to be a thing that needs much caution.
					For when it is the case that the improvement would be small, but it is a bad
					thing to accustom men to repeal the laws lightly, it is clear that some mistakes
					both of the legislator and of the magistrate should be passed over; for the
					people will not be as much benefited by making an alteration as they will be
					harmed by becoming accustomed to distrust their rulers. <milestone n="5.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also, the example from the case of the arts is a
						mistake,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as to change the practice
					of an art is a different thing from altering a law; for the law has no power to
					compel obedience beside the force of custom, and custom only grows up in long
					lapse of time, so that lightly to change from the existing laws to other new
					laws is to weaken the power of the law. Again, even if alteration of the laws is
					proper, are all the laws to be open to alteration, and in every form of
					constitution, or not? and is any chance person to be competent to introduce
					alterations or only certain people? for there is a great difference between
					these alternatives. Therefore let us abandon this inquiry for the present, since
					it belongs to other occasions.<milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On the subject of the constitution of
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and that of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and virtually in regard to the other
					forms of constitution also, the questions that arise for consideration are two,
					one whether their legal structure has any feature that is admirable or the
					reverse in comparison with the best system, another whether it contains any
					provision that is really opposed to the fundamental principle and character of
					the constitution that the founders had in view.<milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it is a thing admitted
					that a state that is to be well governed must be provided with leisure from
					menial occupations; but how this is to be provided it is not easy to ascertain.
					The serf class in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> repeatedly
					rose against its masters, and so did the Helots at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, where they are like an enemy
					constantly sitting in wait for the disasters of the Spartiates. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nothing of the kind has hitherto occurred
					in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, the reason perhaps being that
					the neighboring cities, <milestone n="1269b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>even when at war with one another, in no instance
					ally themselves with the rebels, because as they themselves also possess a serf
					class this would not be for their interest; whereas the Laconians were entirely
					surrounded by hostile neighbors, Argives, Messenians and Arcadians. For with the
					Thessalians too the serf risings originally began because they were still at war
					with their neighbors, the Achaeans, Perraebi and Magnesians. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also, apart from other drawbacks, the mere
					necessity of policing a serf class is an irksome burden&mdash;the problem of
					how intercourse with them is to be carried on: if allowed freedom they grow
					insolent and claim equal rights with their masters, and if made to live a hard
					life they plot against them and hate them. It is clear therefore that those
					whose helot-system works out in this way do not discover the best mode of
					treating the problem. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the
					freedom in regard to women is detrimental both in regard to the purpose of the
					constitution and in regard to the happiness of the state. For just as man and
					wife are part of a household, it is clear that the state also is divided nearly
					in half into its male and female population, so that in all constitutions in
					which the position of the women is badly regulated one half of the state must be
					deemed to have been neglected in framing the law. And this has taken place in
					the state under consideration,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the
					lawgiver wishing the whole city to be of strong character displays his intention
					clearly in relation to the men, but in the case of the women has entirely
					neglected the matter; for they live dissolutely<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The textual emendation giving &lsquo;live without
						restraint&rsquo; is probably correct.</note> in respect of every sort of
					dissoluteness, and luxuriously. <milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So
					that the inevitable result is that in a state thus constituted wealth is held in
					honor, especially if it is the case that the people are under the sway of their
					women, as most of the military and warlike races are, except the Celts and such
					other races as have openly held in honor passionate friendship between males.
					For it appears that the original teller of the legend had good reason for
					uniting Ares with Aphrodite, for all men of martial spirit appear to be
					attracted to the companionship either of male associates or of women. <milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence this characteristic existed among the
					Spartans, and in the time of their empire many things were controlled by the
					women; yet what difference does it make whether the women rule or the rulers are
					ruled by the women? The result is the same. And although bravery is of service
					for none of the regular duties of life, but if at all, in war, even in this
					respect the Spartans' women were most harmful; and they showed this at the time
					of the Theban invasion,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Under Epaminondas,
							<date value="-369">369</date> B.C.</note> for they rendered no useful
					service, as the women do in other states, while they caused more confusion than
					the enemy. <milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is true therefore that
					at the outset the freedom allowed to women at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> seems to have come about with good reason, <milestone n="1270a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the
					Spartans used to be away in exile abroad for long periods on account of their
					military expeditions, both when fighting the war against the Argives and again
					during the war against the Arcadians and Messenians; but when they had turned to
					peaceful pursuits, although they handed over themselves to the lawgiver already
					prepared for obedience by military life &lpar;for this has many elements of
					virtue&rpar;, as for the women it is said that Lycurgus did attempt to bring
					them under the laws, but since they resisted he gave it up. <milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So the Spartan women are, it is true, responsible
					for what took place, and therefore manifestly for this mistake among the rest;
					although for our own part we are not considering the question who deserves
					excuse or does not, but what is the right or wrong mode of action. But, as was
					also said before, errors as regards the status of women seem not only to cause a
					certain unseemliness in the actual conduct of the state but to contribute in
					some degree to undue love of money. <milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For next to the things just spoken of one might censure the Spartan
					institutions with respect to the unequal distribution of wealth. It has come
					about that some of the Spartans own too much property and some extremely little;
					owing to which the land has fallen into few hands, and this has also been badly
					regulated by the laws;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the
					lawgiver made it dishonorable to sell a family's existing estate, and did so
					rightly, but he granted liberty to alienate land at will by gift or bequest; yet
					the result that has happened was bound to follow in the one case as well as in
					the other. <milestone n="6.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also nearly
					two-fifths of the whole area of the country is owned by women, because of the

					of their system of land-tenure has been proved by the actual facts of history:
					the state did not succeed in enduring a single blow,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The battle of Leuctra, <date value="-371">371</date>
						B.C.</note> but perished owing to the smallness of its population. They have
					a tradition that in the earlier reigns they used to admit foreigners to their
					citizenship, with the result that dearth of population did not occur in those
					days, although they were at war for a long period; and it is stated that at one
					time the Spartiates numbered as many as ten thousand. However, whether this is
					true or not, it is better for a state's male population to be kept up by
					measures to equalize property. <milestone n="6.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					law in relation to parentage is also somewhat adverse to the correction of this
					evil. <milestone n="1270b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For the lawgiver desiring to make the Spartiates as numerous as
					possible holds out inducements to the citizens to have as many children as
					possible: for they have a law releasing the man who has been father of three
					sons from military service, and exempting the father of four from all taxes. Yet
					it is clear that if a number of sons are born and the land is correspondingly
					divided there will inevitably come to be many poor men.<milestone n="6.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover the
					regulations for the Ephorate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The five Ephors,
						elected for a year by the people, were the real rulers of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. The two kings were hereditary;
						the senate of twenty-eight nobles advised them, and the Ephors presided at
						the Assembly of citizens over thirty years old, who voted on the measures of
						the Kings and Ephors but could not discuss them. The small fleet was
						commanded by a single admiral appointed for a year by the Ephors and not
						allowed to hold office twice.</note> are also bad. For this office has
					absolute control over their most important affairs, but the Ephors are appointed
					from the entire people, so that quite poor men often happen to get into the
					office, who owing to their poverty used to be<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give
						&lsquo;are.&rsquo;</note> easily bought. This was often manifested
					in earlier times, and also lately in the affair<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Unknown</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName>; for certain Ephors were corrupted with money and so far
					as lay in their power ruined the whole state. And because the office was too
					powerful, and equal to a tyranny, the kings also were compelled to cultivate
					popular favor, so that in this way too the constitution was jointly injured, for
					out of an aristocracy came to be evolved a democracy. <milestone n="6.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus this office does, it is true, hold together the
					constitution&mdash;for the common people keep quiet because they have a
					share in the highest office of state, so that whether this is due to the
					lawgiver or<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>has come about by chance,
					the Ephorate is advantageous for the conduct of affairs; for if a constitution
					is to be preserved, all the sections of the state must wish it to exist and to
					continue on the same lines; so the kings are in this frame of mind owing to
					their own honorable rank, the nobility owing to the office of the Elders, which
					is a prize of virtue, and the common people because of the Ephorate, which is
					appointed from the whole population&mdash;<milestone n="6.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but yet the Ephorate, though rightly open to all the
					citizens, ought not to be elected as it is now, for the method is too
						childish.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">There is no clear evidence what
						the method was.</note> And further the Ephors have jurisdiction in lawsuits
					of high importance, although they are any chance people, so that it would be
					better if they did not decide cases on their own judgement but by written rules
					and according to the laws. Also the mode of life of the Ephors is not in
					conformity with the aim of the state, for it is itself too luxurious, whereas in
					the case of the other citizens the prescribed life goes too far in the direction
					of harshness, so that they are unable to endure it, and secretly desert the law
					and enjoy the pleasures of the body. <milestone n="6.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also their regulations for the office of the Elders are not good; it is true
					that if these were persons of a high class who had been adequately trained in
					manly valor, one might perhaps say that the institution was advantageous to the
					state, although their life-tenure of the judgeship in important trials is indeed
					a questionable feature &lpar;for there is old age of mind as well as of
					body&rpar;; <milestone n="1271a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but as their education has been on such lines that
					even the lawgiver himself cannot trust in them as men of virtue, it is a
					dangerous institution. <milestone n="6.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is
					known that those who have been admitted to this office take bribes and betray
					many of the public interests by favoritism; so that it would be better if they
					were not exempt from having to render an account of their office, but at present
					they are. And it might be held that the magistracy of the Ephors serves to hold
					all the offices to account; but this gives altogether too much to the Ephorate,
					and it is not the way in which, as we maintain, officials ought to be called to
					account. Again, the procedure in the election of the Elders as a mode of
					selection is not only childish, but it is wrong that one who is to be the holder
					of this honorable office should canvass for it, for the man worthy of the office
					ought to hold it whether he wants to or not. <milestone n="6.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But as it is the lawgiver clearly does the same here as in
					the rest of the constitution: he makes the citizens ambitious and has used this
					for the election of the Elders, for nobody would ask for office if he were not
					ambitious; yet surely ambition and love of money are the motives that bring
					about almost the greatest part of the voluntary wrongdoing that takes place
					among mankind. <milestone n="6.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As to monarchy, the
					question whether it is not or is an advantageous institution for states to
						possess<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>may be left to another
					discussion; but at all events it would be advantageous that kings should not be
					appointed as they are now, but chosen in each case with regard to their own life
					and conduct. But it is clear that even the lawgiver himself does not suppose
					that he can make the kings men of high character: at all events he distrusts
					them as not being persons of sufficient worth owing to which the Spartans used
					to send kings who were enemies as colleagues on embassies, and thought that the
					safety of the state depended on division between the kings. <milestone n="6.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the regulations for the the public mess-tables
					called Phiditia have been badly laid down by their originator. The revenue for
					these ought to come rather from public funds, as in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>; but among the Spartans everybody has to contribute,
					although some of them are very poor and unable to find money for this charge, so
					that the result is the opposite of what the lawgiver purposed. For he intends
					the organization of the common tables to be democratic, but when regulated by
					the law in this manner it works out as by no means democratic; for it is not
					easy for the very poor to participate, yet their ancestral regulation of the
					citizenship is that it is not to belong to one who is unable to pay this tax.
						<milestone n="6.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The law about the Admirals has
					been criticized by some other writers also, and rightly criticized; for it acts
					as a cause of sedition, since in addition to the kings who are military
					commanders the office of Admiral stands almost as another kingship. Another
					criticism that may be made against the fundamental principle of the lawgiver
						<milestone n="1271b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is one that Plato has made in the <title>Laws</title>. The
					entire system of the laws is directed towards one part of virtue only, military
					valor, because this is serviceable for conquest. Owing to this they remained
					secure while at war, but began to decline when they had won an empire, because
					they did not know how to live a life of leisure, and had been trained in no
					other form of training more important than the art of war. <milestone n="6.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And another error no less serious than that one is
					this: they think that the coveted prizes of life are won by valor more than by
					cowardice, and in this they are right, yet they imagine wrongly that these
					prizes are worth more than the valor that wins them. The public finance of
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is also badly regulated:
					when compelled to carry on wars on a large scale she has nothing in the state
					treasury, and the Spartiates pay war taxes badly because, as most of the land is
					owned by them, they do not scrutinize each other's contributions. And the
					lawgiver has achieved the opposite result to what is advantageous&mdash;he
					has made the state poor and the individual citizen covetous.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So much for a discussion of the constitution of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>: for these are the main points in it
					for criticism.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The Cretan
					constitution approximates to that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, but though in a few points it is not worse framed, for
					the larger part it has a less perfect finish. For the Spartan constitution
					appears and indeed is actually stated<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g. by
						Hdt 1.65.</note> to have been copied in most of its provisions from the
					Cretan; and as a rule old things have been less fully elaborated than newer
					ones. For it is said that when Lycurgus relinquished his post as guardian of
					King Charilaus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Posthumous son of Lycurgus's
						elder brother King Polydectes; cf.1316a 34.</note> and went abroad, he
					subsequently passed most of his time in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> because of the relationship between the Cretans and the
					Spartans; for the Lyctians<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><placeName key="perseus,Lyctus">Lyctus</placeName> was an inland city in the east
						of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, not far from <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>.</note> were colonists from
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and the settlers that
					went out to the colony found the system of laws already existing among the
					previous inhabitants of the place; owing to which the neighboring villagers even
					now use these laws in the same manner, in the belief that Minos<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Legendary ruler of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, son of Zeus and Europa, and after
						death a judge in the lower world.</note> first instituted this code of laws.
						<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also the island appears to
					have been designed by nature and to be well situated to be under Greek rule, as
					it lies across the whole of the sea, round which almost all the Greeks are
					settled; for <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> is only a short

					there near Camicus.<milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The Cretan organization is on the same lines as that of
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. In <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> the land is tilled by the Helots and
					in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> by the serfs; <milestone n="1272a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and also
					both have public mess-tables, and in old days the Spartans called them not
					&lsquo;phiditia&rsquo; but &lsquo;men's messes,&rsquo; as the
					Cretans do, which is a proof that they came from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. And so also did the system of government; for the Ephors
					have the same power as the magistrates called Cosmi in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, except that the Ephors are five in
					number and the Cosmi ten; and the Elders at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> are equal in number to the Elders whom the Cretans call
					the Council; and monarchy existed in former times, but then the Cretans
					abolished it, and the Cosmi hold the leadership in war; <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and all are members of the Assembly, though it has
					no powers except the function of confirming by vote the resolutions already
					formed by the Elders and the Cosmi.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now the Cretan
					arrangements for the public mess-tables are better than the Spartan; for at
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> each citizen pays a fixed
					poll-tax, failing which he is prevented by law from taking part in the
					government, as has been said before; but in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> the system is more communal, for out of all the crops and
					cattle produced from the public lands, and the tributes paid by the serfs, one
					part is assigned for the worship of the gods and the maintenance of the public
						services,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the other for the
					public mess-tables, so that all the citizens are maintained from the common
					funds, women and children as well as men; <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure
					the benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order
					that they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted
					association with the male sex, as to which there will be another occasion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled</note> to
					consider whether it was a bad thing or a good one. That the regulations for the
					common mess-tables therefore are better in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> than at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is manifest; but the regulations for the Cosmi are even
					worse than those regarding the Ephors. For the evil attaching to the office of
					the Ephors belongs to the Cosmi also, as the post is filled by any chance
					persons, while the benefit conferred on the government by this office at
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is lacking in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. At <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, as the election is made from all the citizens, the
					common people sharing in the highest office desire the maintenance of the
					constitution, but in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> they do not
					elect the Cosmi from all the citizens but from certain clans, and the Elders
					from those who have held the office of Cosmos, <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>about which regulations the same comments might be made as
					about what takes place at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>:
					their freedom from being called to account and their tenure for life gives them
					greater rank than their merit deserves, and their administration of their office
					at their own discretion and not under the guidance of a written code is
					dangerous. And the fact that the common people quietly tolerate their exclusion
					is no proof that the arrangement is a sound one; for the Cosmi unlike the Ephors
					make no sort of profit, <milestone n="1272b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as they live in an island remote from any people to
					corrupt them. Also the remedy which they employ for this defect<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the defect of the undue restriction of
						the office.</note> is a curious one, and less characteristic of a republic
					than of a dynasty<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1292b 10 n.</note>:
						<milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>often the Cosmi are expelled by
					a conspiracy formed among some of their actual colleagues or the private
					citizens. Also the Cosmi are allowed to resign during their term of office. Now
					it would be preferable for all these expedients to be put in force by law rather
					than at the discretion of individuals, for that is a dangerous principle. And
					the worst expedient of all is that of the suspension of the office of Cosmi,
					which is often brought about by members of the powerful class who wish to escape
					being punished; this proves that the constitution has a republican element,
					although it is not actually a republic but rather a dynasty.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1292b 10 n.</note> And the nobles frequently form parties
					among the common people and among their friends and so bring about a suspension
					of government,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MSS. give &lsquo;bring
						about a monarchy.&rsquo;</note> and form factions and engage in war with
					one another. <milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet such a state of
					things is virtually the same as if for a period of time the state underwent an
					entire revolution, and the bonds of civil society were loosened.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And it is a precarious position for a state to be in,

					the Helots often revolt; for the Cretans<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>take no part in foreign empire, and also the island has only

					constitution, with many outstanding features as compared with those of other

					others&mdash;the Cretan, the Spartan and, thirdly, that of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. Many regulations at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> are good; and a proof of a
					well-regulated constitution is that the populace willingly remain faithful to
					the constitutional system, and that neither civil strife has arisen in any
					degree worth mentioning, nor yet a tyrant.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Points in which the
					Carthaginian constitution resembles the Spartan are the common mess-tables of
					its Comradeships corresponding to the Phiditia, and the magistracy of the
					Hundred and Four corresponding to the Ephors &lpar;except one point of
					superiority&mdash;the Ephors are drawn from any class, but the Carthaginians
					elect this magistracy by merit&rpar;; the kings and the council of Elders
					correspond to the kings and Elders at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and it is another superior feature that the
					Carthaginian kings are not confined to the same family and that one of no
					particular distinction, and also that if any family distinguishes itself . .
						.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Clauses seem to have been lost
						concluding the account of the appointment of the Kings and turning to the

					have already injured the Spartan State.<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Most of the points
					therefore in the Carthaginian system that would be criticized on the ground of
					their divergences happen to be common to all the constitutions of which we have
					spoken; but the features open to criticism as judged by the principle of an
					aristocracy or republic are some of them departures in the direction of
					democracy and others in the direction of oligarchy. The reference of some
					matters and not of others to the popular assembly rests with the kings in
					consultation with the Elders in case they agree<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. agree to refer or not to refer</note> unanimously, but
					failing that, these matters also lie with the people<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. even when the Kings only or the Elders only desire
						reference, it takes place</note>; and when the kings introduce business in
					the assembly, they do not merely let the people sit and listen to the decisions
					that have been taken by their rulers, but the people have the sovereign
					decision, and anybody who wishes may speak against the proposals introduced, a
					right that does not exist under the other constitutions. <milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The appointment by co-optation of the Boards of
					Five which control many important matters, and the election by these boards of
					the supreme magistracy of the Hundred, and also their longer tenure of authority
					than that of any other officers &lpar;for they are in power after they have
					gone out of office and before they have actually entered upon it&rpar; are
					oligarchical features; their receiving no pay and not being chosen by lot and
					other similar regulations must be set down as aristocratic, and so must the fact
					that the members of the Boards are the judges in all lawsuits,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>instead of different suits being tried by different
					courts as at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the Carthaginian system diverges from
					aristocracy in the direction of oligarchy most signally in respect of a certain
					idea that is shared by the mass of mankind; they think that the rulers should be
					chosen not only for their merit but also for their wealth, as it is not possible
					for a poor man to govern well or to have leisure for his duties. If therefore
					election by wealth is oligarchical and election by merit aristocratic, this will
					be a third system exhibited in the organization of the constitution of
						<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, for there elections
					are made with an eye to these two qualifications, and especially elections to
					the most important offices, those of the kings and of the generals. <milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it must be held that this divergence
					from aristocracy is an error on the part of a lawgiver; for one of the most
					important points to keep in view from the outset is that the best citizens may
					be able to have leisure and may not have to engage in any unseemly occupation,
					not only when in office but also when living in private life. And if it is
					necessary to look to the question of means for the sake of leisure, it is a bad
					thing that the greatest offices of state, the kingship and the generalship,
					should be for sale. For this law makes wealth more honored than worth, and
					renders the whole state avaricious; <milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and whatever the holders of supreme power deem honorable, the opinion of the
					other citizens also is certain to follow them, and a state in which virtue is
					not held in the highest honor <milestone n="1273b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>cannot be securely governed by an
					aristocracy. And it is probable that those who purchase office will learn by
					degrees to make a profit out of it, when they hold office for money spent; for
					it would be odd if a man of small means but respectable should want to make a
					profit but an inferior person when he has spent money to get elected should not
					want to. Hence the persons who should be in office are those most capable of
					holding office. And even if the lawgiver neglected to secure comfortable means
					for respectable people, it would at all events be better that he should provide
					for their leisure while in office.<milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And it might also be thought a bad thing
					for the same person to hold several offices, which is considered a distinction
					at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. One man one job is
					the best rule for efficiency, and the lawgiver ought to see that this may be
					secured, and not appoint the same man to play the flute and make shoes. Hence
					except in a small city it is more statesmanlike for a larger number to share in
					the offices and more democratic, for it is fairer to all, as we said, and also
					functions are performed better and more quickly when separate than by the same
					people. This is clear in military and naval matters; for in both of these
					departments command and subordination penetrate throughout almost the whole
						body.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. everyone in command
						&lpar;except the commander-in-chief&rpar; has someone of higher rank

					<milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But
					the constitution being oligarchical they best escape the dangers by being
					wealthy, as they constantly send out a portion of the common people to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>appointments in the cities; by this means
					they heal the social sore and make the constitution stable. However, this is the
					achievement of fortune, whereas freedom from civil strife ought to be secured by

					taken no part in any political activities whatever but have passed their whole
					life as private citizens; and something has been said about almost all the
					writers of this class about whom there is anything noteworthy. Some on the other
					hand have been lawgivers, either for their native cities or even for certain
					foreign peoples, after having themselves been actively engaged in government;
					and of these some have been framers of laws only, and others of a constitution
					also, for instance Solon and Lycurgus, who instituted both laws and
					constitutions. The Spartan constitution has been discussed. <milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for Solon, he is considered by some people to
					have been a good lawgiver, as having put an end to oligarchy when it was too
					unqualified and having liberated the people from slavery and restored the
					ancestral democracy with a skilful blending of the constitution: the Council on
					the Areopagus being an oligarchic element, the elective magistracies
					aristocratic and the law-courts democratic. And although really in regard to
					certain of these features, the Council and the election of magistrates,
						<milestone n="1274a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Solon seems merely to have abstained from destroying
					institutions that existed already, he does appear to have founded the democracy
					by constituting the jury-courts from all the citizens. <milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this he is actually blamed by some persons, as having
					dissolved the power of the other parts of the community by making the law-court,
					which was elected by lot, all-powerful. For as the law-court grew strong, men

				<p><milestone n="1274b" unit="section"/><milestone n="32" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For the student of government, and of nature and characteristics of the
					various forms of constitution, almost the first question to consider is in
					regard to the state: what exactly is the essential nature of a state? As it is,
					this is a matter of dispute: a public act is spoken of by some people as the
					action of the state, others speak of it as the action not of the state but of
					the oligarchy or the tyrant in power<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">So we
						speak of an action planned and carried by the party in power as an Act of
						Parliament, and technically as an act of the sovereign.</note>; and we see
					that the activity of the statesman and lawgiver is entirely concerned with a
					state as its object, and a constitution is a form of organization of the
					inhabitants of a state. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But a state
					is a composite thing, in the same sense as any other of the things that are
					wholes but consist of many parts; it is therefore clear that we must first
					inquire into the nature of a citizen; for a state is a collection of citizens,
						<milestone n="1275a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so that we have to consider who is entitled to the name of
					citizen, and what the essential nature of a citizen is. For there is often a
					difference of opinion as to this: people do not all agree that the same person
					is a citizen; often somebody who would be a citizen in a democracy is not a
					citizen under an oligarchy. <milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We need
					not here consider those who acquire the title of citizen in some exceptional
					manner, for example those who are citizens by adoption; and citizenship is not
					constituted by domicile in a certain place &lpar;for resident aliens and
					slaves share the domicile of citizens&rpar;, nor are those citizens who
					participate in a common system of justice, conferring the right to defend an
					action and to bring one in the law-courts &lpar;for this right belongs also
					to the parties under a commercial treaty, as they too can sue and be sued at
					law,&mdash;or rather, in many places even the right of legal action is not
					shared completely by resident aliens, but they are obliged to produce a patron,
					so that they only share in a common legal procedure to an incomplete
					degree&rpar;, <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but these are only
					citizens in the manner in which children who are as yet too young to have been
					enrolled in the list and old men who have been discharged<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems to imply that aged citizens were excused
						attendance at the assembly and law-courts, as well as military
						service</note> must be pronounced to be citizens in a sense, yet not quite
					absolutely, but with the added qualification of &lsquo;under age&rsquo;
					in the case of the former and &lsquo;superannuated&rsquo; or some other
					similar term &lpar;it makes no difference, the meaning being clear&rpar;
					in that of the latter. For we seek to define a citizen in the absolute sense,
					and one possessing no<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>disqualification
					of this nature that requires a correcting term, since similar difficulties may
					also be raised, and solved, about citizens who have been disfranchised or
					exiled. A citizen pure and simple is defined by nothing else so much as by the
					right to participate in judicial functions and in office. But some offices of
					government are definitely limited in regard to time, so that some of them are
					not allowed to be held twice by the same person at all, or only after certain
					fixed intervals of time; other officials are without limit of tenure, for
					example the juryman and the member of the assembly. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It might perhaps be said that such persons are not
					officials at all, and that the exercise of these functions does not constitute
					the holding of office;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, amending the text,
						&lsquo;and yet that it is absurd to deny the title of citizen to
						those&mdash;&rsquo;</note> and yet it is absurd to deny the title of
					official to those who have the greatest power in the state. But it need not make
					any difference, as it is only the question of a name, since there is no common
					name for a juryman and a member of the assembly that is properly applied to
					both. For the sake of distinction therefore let us call the combination of the
					two functions &lsquo;office&rsquo; without limitation. Accordingly we
					lay it down that those are citizens who participate in office in this
						manner.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such more or less is the definition of
					&lsquo;citizen&rsquo; that would best fit with all of those to whom the
					name is applied. <milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it must not be
					forgotten that things in the case of which the things to which they are related
					differ in kind, one of them being primary, another one secondary and so on,
					either do not contain a common nature at all, as being what they are, or barely
					do so.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The meaning of this abstract principle
						is most easily seen from its application here: if states are generically
						different from one another, membership of a state, citizenship, can hardly
						be a single thing, and come under a single definition.</note> Now we see
					that constitutions differ from one another in kind, and that some are subsequent
					and others prior; <milestone n="1275b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for erroneous and divergent forms are necessarily
					subsequent to correct forms &lpar;in what sense we employ the terms
					&lsquo;divergent&rsquo; of constitutions will appear later&rpar;.
					Hence the citizen corresponding to each form of constitution will also
					necessarily be different. Therefore the definition of a citizen that we have
					given applies especially to citizenship in a democracy; under other forms of
					government it may hold good, but will not necessarily do so. <milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in some states there is no body of common
					citizens, and they do not have the custom of a popular assembly but councils of
					specially convened members, and the office of trying law-suits goes by
					sections&mdash;for example at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> suits for breach of contract are tried by different
					ephors in different cases, while cases of homicide are tried by the ephors and
					doubtless other suits by some other magistrate. The same method is not<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The negative is a conjectural insertion, cf.
						1273a 20.</note> followed at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, where certain magistrates judge all the law-suits.
						<milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But still, our definition of a
					citizen admits of correction. For under the other forms of constitution a member
					of the assembly and of a jury-court is not &lsquo;an official&rsquo;
					without restriction, but an official defined according to his office; either all
					of them or some among them are assigned deliberative and judicial duties either
					in all matters or in certain matters. What constitutes a citizen is therefore
					clear from these considerations: we now declare that one who has the right to
					participate in deliberative or judicial office is a citizen of the
						state<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in which he has that right,
					and a state is a collection of such persons sufficiently numerous, speaking
					broadly, to secure independence of life.<milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But in practice citizenship
					is limited to the child of citizens on both sides, not on one side only, that
					is, the child of a citizen father or of a citizen mother; and other people carry
					this requirement further back, for example to the second or the third preceding
					generation or further. But given this as a practical and hasty definition, some
					people raise the difficulty, How will that ancestor three or four generations
					back have been a citizen? Gorgias<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Sicilian
						orator and nihilistic philosopher, visited <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
						<date value="-427">427</date> B.C.</note> of Leontini therefore, partly
					perhaps in genuine perplexity but partly in jest, said that just as the vessels
					made by mortar-makers were mortars, so the citizens made by the magistrates were
					Larisaeans, since some of the magistrates were actually larisa-makers.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><placeName key="perseus,Larisa,Aeolis">Larisa</placeName>, a city in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, was famous for the manufacture of a kind of
						kettle called &lsquo;larisa.&rsquo;</note> But it is really a simple
					matter; for if they possessed citizenship in the manner stated in our definition
					of a citizen, they were citizens&mdash;since it is clearly impossible to
					apply the qualification of descent from a citizen father or mother to the
					original colonizers or founders of a city.<milestone n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But perhaps a question
					rather arises about those who were admitted to citizenship when a revolution had
					taken place, for instance such a creation of citizens as that carried out<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In <date value="-509">509</date> B.C.</note>
					at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by Cleisthenes after the
					expulsion of the tyrants, when he enrolled in his tribes many resident aliens
					who had been foreigners or slaves. The dispute as to these is not about the fact
					of their citizenship, but whether they received it wrongly or rightly. Yet even
					as to this one might raise the further question, <milestone n="1276a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>whether, if a man
					is not rightly a citizen, he is a citizen at all, as
					&lsquo;wrongly&rsquo; means the same as &lsquo;not truly.&rsquo;
					But we sometimes see officials governing wrongly, as to whom we shall not deny
					that they do govern, but shall say that they do not do it rightly, and a citizen
					is defined by a certain function of government &lpar;a citizen, as we said,
					is one who shares in such and such an office&rpar;; therefore it is clear
					that even persons wrongly admitted to citizenship are to be pronounced to be
					citizens, although the question whether they are so rightly or not rightly is
					connected with the question that was propounded before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The question, What is a state? 1274b 34.</note> For some
					persons raise the question, When is an occurrence the act of the state and when
					is it not? for example, when the government has been altered from oligarchy or
					tyranny to democracy. In such circumstances some people claim that the new
					government should not discharge public debts, on the ground that the money was
					borrowed by the tyrant and not by the state, and should repudiate many other
					similar claims also, because some forms of government rest upon force and are
					not aimed at the welfare of the community. <milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If therefore some democracies also are governed in that
					manner, the acts of the authorities in their case can only be said to be the
					acts of the state in the same sense as the public acts emanating from an
					oligarchy or a tyranny are said to be. Akin to this controversy seems to be the
					subject, What exactly is the principle on which we ought to pronounce a city to
					be the same city as it was before, or not the same but a different city? The
					most obvious mode of inquiring into this difficulty<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>deals with place and people: the place and the people may have
					been divided, and some may have settled in one place, and some in another. In
					this form the question must be considered as easier of solution; for, as
					&lsquo;city&rsquo; has several meanings, the inquiry so put is in a way
					not difficult.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. <foreign lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> means both &lpar;1&rpar;
						&lsquo;city&rsquo; &lpar;and also
						&lsquo;citadel&rsquo;&rpar; and &lpar;2&rpar;
						&lsquo;state,&rsquo; a collection of citizens; and if the citizens
						divide and settle in two different &lsquo;cities&rsquo; with
						different governments, they are clearly not the same
						&lsquo;state&rsquo; as before.</note>
					<milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it may similarly be asked,
					Suppose a set of men inhabit the same place, in what circumstances are we to
					consider their city to be a single city? Its unity clearly does not depend on
					the walls, for it would be possible to throw a single wall round the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>; and a case in point perhaps is
						<placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, and any other city that
					has the circuit of a nation rather than of a city; for it is said that when
						<placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> was captured a considerable
					part of the city was not aware of it three days later. But the consideration of
					this difficulty will be serviceable for another occasion, as the student of
					politics must not ignore the question, What is the most advantageous size for a
					city, and should its population be of one race or of several? <milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But are we to pronounce a city, where the
					same population inhabit the same place, to be the same city so long as the
					population are of the same race, in spite of the fact that all the time some are
					dying and others being born, just as it is our custom to say that a river or a
					spring is the same river or spring although one stream of water is always being
					added to it and another being withdrawn from it, or are we to say that though
					the people are the same people for the similar reason of continuity, yet the
					city is a different city? <milestone n="1276b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For inasmuch as a state is a kind of partnership,
					and is in fact a partnership of citizens in a government, when the form of the
					government has been altered and is different it would appear to follow that the
					state is no longer the same state, just as we say that a chorus which on one
					occasion acts a comedy and on another a tragedy is a different chorus although
					it is often composed of the same persons, <milestone n="1.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and similarly with any other common whole or composite
					structure we say it is different if the form of its structure is
					different&mdash;for instance a musical tune consisting of the same notes we
					call a different tune if at one time it is played in the Dorian mode and at
					another in the Phrygian. Therefore if this is the case, it is clear that we must
					speak of a state as being the same state chiefly with regard to its
					constitution; and it is possible for it to be called by the same or by a
					different designation both when its inhabitants are the same and when they are
					entirely different persons. But whether a state is or is not bound in justice to
					discharge its engagements when it has changed to a different constitution, is
					another subject.<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The next thing to consider after what has now been said is the
					question whether we are to hold that the goodness of a good man is the same as
					that of a good citizen, or not the same. However, if this point really is to
					receive investigation, we must first ascertain in some general outline what
					constitutes the excellence of a citizen.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Now a citizen we pronounced to be one sort of partner in a
					community, as is a sailor. And although sailors differ from each other in
					function&mdash;one is an oarsman, another helmsman, another look-out man,
					and another has some other similar special designation&mdash;and so clearly
					the most exact definition of their excellence will be special to each, yet there
					will also be a common definition of excellence that will apply alike to all of
					them; for security in navigation is the business of them all, since each of the
					sailors aims at that. <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly
					therefore with the citizens, although they are dissimilar from one another,
					their business is the security of their community, and this community is the
					constitution, so that the goodness of a citizen must necessarily be relative to
					the constitution of the state. If therefore there are various forms of
					constitution, it is clear that there cannot be one single goodness which is the
					perfect goodness of the good citizen; but when we speak of a good man we mean
					that he possesses one single goodness, perfect goodness. Hence it is manifestly
					possible to be a good citizen without possessing the goodness that constitutes a
					good man. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover it is also
					feasible to pursue the same topic by raising the question in another manner in
					relation to the best form of constitution. If it is impossible<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give
						&lsquo;possible&rsquo;. If we emend the text with Bernays to
							<foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r du/naton e)c a(pa/ntwn spoudai/wn o)/ntwn
							ei)=nai po/lin</foreign>, the sense is: assuming the possibility of a
						perfect state, with all its factors the best of their kind, this means that
						all the population will be good citizens, not that they will all be perfect
						specimens of the human race, because the state needs citizens of the working
						classes, etc., and these cannot in the nature of things be perfect human
						beings</note> for a state to consist entirely of good men, and if it is
					necessary for each person to perform well the work of his position, and to do
					this springs from goodness, then because it is impossible for all the citizens
					to be alike, <milestone n="1277a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the goodness of a good citizen would not be one and the same as
					the goodness of a good man; for all ought to possess the goodness of the good
					citizen &lpar;that is a necessary condition of the state's being the best
					possible&rpar;, but it is impossible that all should possess the goodness of
					a good man, if it is not necessary that all the citizens in a good state should
					be good men. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, since the state
					consists of unlike persons&mdash;just as an animal &lpar;to take this
					instance first&rpar; consists of soul and body, and a soul of reason and
					appetite, and a household of husband and wife and &lsqb;ownership
						involves&rsqb;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These words in the
						Greek are probably an interpolation.</note> a master and slave, in the same
					manner a state consists of all of these persons and also of others of different
					classes in addition to these,&mdash;it necessarily follows that the goodness
					of all the citizens is not one and the same, just as among dancers the skill of
					a head dancer is not the same as that of a subordinate leader. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear then from these considerations
					that the goodness of a good citizen and that of a good man are not the same in
					general; but will the goodness of a good citizen of a particular sort be the
					same as that of a good man? Now we say that a good ruler is virtuous and wise,
					and that a citizen taking part in politics must be wise. Also some people say
					that even the education of a ruler must be different, as indeed we see that the
					sons of kings are educated in horsemanship and military exercises, and Euripides
						says<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Fragment 16, from
							<title>Aeolus</title>.</note>
					<quote type="verse">
						<l met="iambic">No subtleties for me, but what the state</l>
						<l>Requireth&mdash;</l>
					</quote><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>implying that there is a
					special education for a ruler. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					if the goodness of a good ruler is the same as the goodness of a good man, yet
					the person ruled is also a citizen, so that the goodness of a citizen in general
					will not be the same as that of a man, although that of a particular citizen
					will; for goodness as a ruler is not the same as goodness as a citizen, and no
					doubt this is the reason why Jason<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Tyrant of
						Pherae in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, assassinated
							<date value="-370">370</date> B.C.</note> said that when he was not
					tyrant he went hungry, meaning that he did not know the art of being a private
					person. <milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Another point is that we
					praise the ability to rule and to be ruled, and it is doubtless held that the
					goodness of a citizen consists in ability both to rule and to be ruled well. If
					then we lay it down that the goodness of the good man is displayed in ruling,
					whereas that of the citizen is shown in both capacities, the two capacities
					cannot be equally laudable. Since therefore both views are sometimes accepted,
					and it is thought that the ruler and the subject do not have to learn the same
					arts but that the citizen must know both arts and share in both capacities, . .
					. .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some words seem to have been lost,
						conveying &lsquo;we must consider how this dual fitness can be

					from the following illustration: one form of authority is that of a master;
						<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>by this we mean the exercise of
					authority in regard to the necessary work of the house, which it is not
					necessary for the master to know how to execute, but rather how to utilize; the
					other capacity, I mean the ability actually to serve in these menial tasks, is
					indeed a slave's quality. But we distinguish several kinds of slave, as their
					employments are several. One department belongs to the handicraftsmen, who as
					their name implies are the persons that live by their hands, <milestone n="1277b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>a class
					that includes the mechanic artisan. Hence in some states manual laborers were
					not admitted to office in old times, before the development of extreme
					democracy. <milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The tasks of those who
					are under this form of authority therefore it is not proper for the good man or
					the man fit for citizenship or the good citizen to learn, except for his own
					private use occasionally &lpar;for then it ceases to be a case of the one
					party being master and the other slave&rpar;. But there exists a form of
					authority by which a man rules over persons of the same race as himself, and
					free men &lpar;for that is how we describe political authority&rpar;,
					and this the ruler should learn by being ruled, just as a man should command
					cavalry after having served as a trooper, command a regiment after having served
					in a regiment and been in command of a company and of a platoon. Hence there is
					much truth in the saying that it is impossible to become a good ruler without
					having been a subject. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And although
					the goodness of a ruler and that of a subject are different, the good citizen
					must have the knowledge and the ability both to be ruled and to rule, and the
					merit of the good citizen consists in having a knowledge of the government of
					free men on both sides. And therefore both these virtues are characteristic of a
					good man, even if temperance and justice in a ruler are of a different kind from
					temperance and justice in a subject; for clearly a good man's virtue, for
					example his justice, will not be one and the same when he is under government
					and when he is free, but it will be of different kinds,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>one fitting him to rule and one to be ruled, just
					as temperance and courage are different in a man and in a woman &lpar;for a
					man would be thought a coward if he were only as brave as a brave woman, and a
					woman a chatterer if she were only as modest as a good man; since even the
					household functions of a man and of a woman are different&mdash;his business
					is to get and hers to keep&rpar;. <milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And practical wisdom alone of the virtues is a virtue
					peculiar to a ruler; for the other virtues seem to be necessary alike for both
					subjects and rulers to possess, but wisdom assuredly is not a subject's virtue,
					but only right opinion: the subject corresponds to the man who makes flutes and
					the ruler to the flute-player who uses them.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The
					question whether the goodness of a good man is the same as that of a good
					citizen or different, and how they are the same and how different, is clear from
					these considerations.<milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But one of the difficulties as to what constitutes a
					citizen is still left. Is it truly the case that a citizen is a person who has
					the right to share office in the government, or are the working classes also to
					be counted citizens? If these persons also are to be counted who have no share
					in offices, it is not possible for every citizen to possess the citizen's
					virtue; for the true citizen is the man capable of governing.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps &lsquo;for the working-man is a
						citizen.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos ga\r poli/ths</foreign>.
						The translation takes <foreign lang="greek">poli/ths</foreign> as subject
						and <foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos</foreign> as predicate &lpar;meaning
							<foreign lang="greek">e)/xwn th\n toiau/thn a)reth/n</foreign>,
						possessing capacity to govern&rpar;. But possibly the predicate is
							<foreign lang="greek">poli/ths</foreign> and the subject <foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos</foreign>, which then stands for <foreign lang="greek">o( ba/nausos</foreign>; if so, the whole sentence means
						that if the non-official classes are citizens, not all the citizens will
						possess civic virtue &lpar;which is capacity to govern&rpar;, for
						the working-man will be a citizen &lpar;and he is not capable of
						governing&rpar;.</note> If on the other hand no one of the working
					people is a citizen, in what class are the various workers to be ranked? for
					they are neither resident aliens nor foreigners. Or shall we say that so far as
					that argument goes no inconsistency results? <milestone n="1278a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for slaves also are not in one
					of the classes mentioned, nor are freedmen. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is true that not all the persons indispensable for
					the existence of a state are to be deemed citizens, since even the sons of
					citizens are not citizens in the same sense as the adults: the latter are
					citizens in the full sense, the former only by presumption<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, with Casaubon's probable correction of the Greek,
						&lsquo;only with a qualification.&rsquo;</note>&mdash;they are
					citizens, but incomplete ones. In ancient times in fact the artisan class in
					some states consisted of slaves or aliens, owing to which the great mass of
					artisans are so even now; and the best-ordered state will not make an artisan a
					citizen. While if even the artisan is a citizen, then what we said to be the
					citizen's virtue must not be said to belong to every citizen, nor merely be
					defined as the virtue of a free man, but will only belong to those who are
					released from menial occupations. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Among menial occupations those who render such services to an individual are
					slaves, and those who do so for the community are artisans and hired laborers.
					The state of the case about them will be manifest from what follows when we
					consider it a little further&lsqb;, for what has been said when made known
					itself makes it clear&rsqb;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						ill-expressed clause &lsquo;for what&mdash;clear&rsquo; seems
						almost certainly to be an interpolation.</note> As there are several forms
					of constitution, it follows that there are several kinds of citizen, and
					especially of the citizen in a subject position; hence under one form of
					constitution citizenship will necessarily extend to the artisan and the hired
					laborer, while under other forms this is impossible, for instance in any
					constitution that is of the form entitled aristocratic and in which<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the honors are bestowed according to
					goodness and to merit, since a person living a life of manual toil or as a hired
					laborer cannot practise the pursuits in which goodness is exercised. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In oligarchies on the other hand, though it
					is impossible for a hired laborer to be a citizen &lpar;since admission to
					office of various grades is based on high property-assessments&rpar;, it is
					possible for an artisan; for even the general mass of the craftsmen are rich. At
						<placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> there was a law that no
					one who had not kept out of trade for the last ten years might be admitted to
					office. But under many constitutions the law draws recruits even from
					foreigners; for in some democracies the son of a citizen-mother is a citizen,
						<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the same rule holds good as
					to base-born sons in many places. Nevertheless, inasmuch as such persons are
					adopted as citizens owing to a lack of citizens of legitimate birth
					&lpar;for legislation of this kind is resorted to because of
					under-population&rpar;, when a state becomes well off for numbers it
					gradually divests itself first of the sons of a slave father or mother, then of
					those whose mothers only were citizens, and finally only allows citizenship to
					the children of citizens on both sides. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These facts then show that there are various kinds of
					citizen, and that a citizen in the fullest sense means the man who shares in the
					honors of the state, as is implied in the verse of Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.648">Hom. Il. 9.648</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.59">Hom. Il. 16.59</bibl></note>: <quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">Like to some alien settler without honor,&mdash;</l>

					the purpose of deceiving those who are a part of the population.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MSS. give &lsquo;But where such

					<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The answer therefore to the question, <milestone n="1278b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Is the
					goodness that makes a good man to be deemed the same as that which makes a
					worthy citizen, or different? is now clear from what has been said in one form
					of state the good man and the good citizen are the same, but in another they are
					different, and also in the former case it is not every citizen but only the
					statesman, the man who controls or is competent to control, singly or with
					colleagues, the administration of the commonwealth, that is essentially also a
					good man.<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since these points have been determined, the next question
					to be considered is whether we are to lay it down that there is only one form of
					constitution or several, and if several, what they are and how many and what are
					the differences between them. Now a constitution is the ordering of a state in
					respect of its various magistracies, and especially the magistracy that is
					supreme over all matters. For the government is everywhere supreme over the
					state and the constitution is the government. I mean that in democratic states
					for example the people are supreme, but in oligarchies on the contrary the few
					are; and we say that they have a different constitution. And we shall use the
					same language about the other forms of government also.<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have therefore to
					determine first the fundamental points, what is the object for which a state
					exists and how many different kinds of system there are for governing mankind
					and for controlling the common life.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it has
					been said in our first discourses,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1253a 1
						ff.</note> in which we determined the principles concerning household
					management and the control of slaves, that man is by nature a political
						animal;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and so even when men have
					no need of assistance from each other they none the less desire to live
					together. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>At the same time they are
					also brought together by common interest, so far as each achieves a share of the
					good life. The good life then is the chief aim of society, both collectively for
					all its members and individually; but they also come together and maintain the
					political partnership for the sake of life merely, for doubtless there is some
					element of value contained even in the mere state of being alive, provided that
					there is not too great an excess on the side of the hardships of life, and it is
					clear that the mass of mankind cling to life at the cost of enduring much
					suffering, which shows that life contains some measure of well-being and of
					sweetness in its essential nature.<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And again, the several recognized varieties
					of government can easily be defined; in fact we frequently discuss them in our
					external discourses.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Mentioned at 1323a 22
						&lpar;and also six times in other books&rpar;; they are there
						appealed to for the tripartite classification of foods which in <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098b">Aristot. Nic. Eth.1098b 12</bibl> is
						ascribed to &lsquo;current opinion of long standing and generally
						accepted by students of philosophy.&rsquo; The term may there predenote
						doctrines not peculiar to the Peripatetic school.</note> The authority of a
					master over a slave, although in truth when both master and slave are designed
					by nature for their positions their interests are the same, nevertheless governs
					in the greater degree with a view to the interest of the master, but
					incidentally with a view to that of the slave, for if the slave deteriorates the
					position of the master cannot be saved from injury. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Authority over children and wife &lsqb;and over the
					whole household, which we call the art of household management<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aristotle can hardly have written this clause,
						as it includes mastership over slaves.</note>&rsqb; is exercised either
					in the interest of those ruled or for some common interest of both
					parties,&mdash;essentially, in the interest of the ruled, as we see that the
					other arts also, <milestone n="1279a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>like medicine and athletic training, are pursued in
					the interest of the persons upon whom they are practised, although incidentally
					they may also be in the interest of the practitioners themselves; for nothing
					prevents the trainer from being on occasions himself also one of the persons in
					training, just as the pilot is always a member of the crew; so although the
					trainer or pilot studies the good of those under his authority, when he himself
					also becomes one among them he incidentally shares the benefit, for the pilot is
					a sailor in the ship and the trainer can become one of the persons in training
					under his own direction. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence in
					regard to the political offices also, when the state is constituted on the
					principle of equality and of similarity between the citizens, these claim to
					hold office by turn&mdash;in earlier times, under the natural system,
					claiming to do public services in turn, and for somebody in return to look after
					their own welfare just as previously they looked after his interest when in
					office themselves; but nowadays owing to the benefits to be got from public
					sources and from holding office people wish to be in office continuously, just
					as if it were the case that those in office although sickly people always
					enjoyed good health&mdash;in which case office would no doubt be much run
					after by invalids.<milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is clear then that those constitutions that aim at the
					common advantage are in effect rightly framed in accordance with absolute
					justice, while those that aim at the rulers' own advantage only are
						faulty,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and are all of them
					deviations from the right constitutions; for they have an element of despotism,
					whereas a city is a partnership of free men.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These
					matters having been determined the next step is to consider how many forms of
					constitution there are and what they are; and first to study the right forms of
					constitution, since the deviations will also become manifest when these are
						defined.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But inasmuch as &lsquo;constitution&rsquo; means the
					same as &lsquo;government,&rsquo; and the government is the supreme
					power in the state, and this must be either a single ruler or a few or the mass
					of the citizens, in cases when the one or the few or the many govern with an eye
					to the common interest, these constitutions must necessarily be right ones,
					while those administered with an eye to the private interest of either the one
					or the few or the multitude are deviations. For either we must not say that
					those who are part of the state are citizens, or those who are part of the state
					must share in the advantage of membership. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Our customary designation for a monarchy that aims at the
					common advantage is &lsquo;kingship&rsquo;; for a government of more
					than one yet only a few &lsquo;aristocracy&rsquo; &lpar;either
					because the best men rule or because they rule with a view to what is best for
					the state and for its members&rpar;; while when the multitude govern the
					state with a view to the common advantage, it is called by the name common to
					all the forms of constitution, &lsquo;constitutional government.&rsquo;
						<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;And this comes about
					reasonably, since although it is possible for one man or a few to excel in
					virtue, when the number is larger it becomes difficult for them to possess
					perfect excellence in respect of every form of virtue, <milestone n="1279b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but they can best
					excel in military valor, for this is found with numbers; and therefore with this
					form of constitution the class that fights for the state in war is the most
					powerful, and it is those who possess arms who are admitted to the
					government.&rpar; <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Deviations
					from the constitutions mentioned are tyranny corresponding to kingship,
					oligarchy to aristocracy, and democracy to constitutional government; for
					tyranny is monarchy ruling in the interest of the monarch, oligarchy government
					in the interest of the rich, democracy government in the interest of the poor,
					and none of these forms governs with regard to the profit of the
						community.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But it is necessary to say at a
					little greater length what each of these constitutions is; for the question
					involves certain difficulties, and it is the special mark of one who studies any
					subject philosophically, and not solely with regard to its practical aspect,
					that he does not overlook or omit any point, but brings to light the truth about
					each. <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now tyranny, as has been said,
					is monarchy exerting despotic power over the political community; oligarchy is
					when the control of the government is in the hands of those that own the
					properties; democracy is when on the contrary it is in the hands of those that
					do not possess much property, but are poor.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>A first difficulty is with regard to the definition. If the
					majority of the citizens were wealthy and were in control of the state, yet when
					the multitude is in power it is a democracy, and similarly, to take the other
					case, if it were to occur somewhere that the poor were fewer than the rich but
					were stronger than they and accordingly were in control of the government, yet
					where a small number is in control it is said to be an oligarchy, then it would
					seem that our definition of the forms of constitution was not a good one.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. it would be absurd to term government by
						the people democracy if the people happened to be very rich, or government
						by a few oligarchy if the few were poor and the many whom they governed
						rich.</note>
					<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And once again, if one assumed the
					combination of small numbers with wealth and of multitude with poverty, and
					named the constitutions thus&mdash;one in which the rich being few in number
					hold the offices, oligarchy: one in which the poor being many in number hold the
					offices, democracy,&mdash;this involves another difficulty. What names are
					we to give to the constitutions just described&mdash;the one in which there
					are more rich and the one in which the poor are the fewer, and these control
					their respective governments&mdash;if there exists no other form of
					constitution beside those mentioned? <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The argument therefore seems to make it clear that for few or many to have
					power is an accidental feature of oligarchies in the one case and democracies in
					the other, due to the fact that the rich are few and the poor are many
					everywhere &lpar;so that it is not really the case that the points mentioned
					constitute a specific difference&rpar;, but that the real thing in which
					democracy and oligarchy differ from each other is poverty and wealth; <milestone n="1280a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and it
					necessarily follows that wherever the rulers owe their power to wealth, whether
					they be a minority or a majority, this is an oligarchy, and when the poor rule,
					it is a democracy, although it does accidentally happen, as we said, that where
					the rulers hold power by wealth they are few and where they hold power by
					poverty they are many, because few men are rich but all men possess freedom, and
					wealth and freedom are the grounds on which the two classes lay claim to the
						government.<milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And first we must ascertain what are stated to be the
					determining qualities of oligarchy and democracy, and what is the principle of
					justice under the one form of government and under the other. For all men lay
					hold on justice of some sort, but they only advance to a certain point, and do
					not express the principle of absolute justice in its entirety. For instance, it
					is thought that justice is equality, and so it is, though not for everybody but
					only for those who are equals; and it is thought that inequality is just, for so
					indeed it is, though not for everybody, but for those who are unequal; but these
					partisans strip away the qualification of the persons concerned, and judge
					badly. And the cause of this is that they are themselves concerned in the
					decision, and perhaps most men are bad judges when their own interests are in
					question. <milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence inasmuch as
					&lsquo;just&rsquo; means just for certain persons, and it is divided in
					the same way in relation to the things to be distributed and the persons that
					receive them, as has been said before in the Ethics,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1131a">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
							1131a 14-24</bibl>.</note> the two parties agree as to what constitutes
					equality in the thing, but dispute as to what constitutes equality in the
						person,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>chiefly for the reason
					just now stated, because men are bad judges where they themselves are concerned,
					but also, inasmuch as both parties put forward a plea that is just up to a
					certain point, they think that what they say is absolutely just. For the one
					side think that if they are unequal in some respects, for instance in wealth,
					they are entirely unequal, and the other side think that if they are equal in
					some respects, for instance in freedom, they are entirely equal. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the most important thing they do not
					mention. If men formed the community and came together for the sake of wealth,
					their share in the state is proportionate to their share in the property, so
					that the argument of the champions of oligarchy would appear to be
					valid&mdash;namely that in a partnership with a capital of 100 minae<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1268b 14 n.</note> it would not be just
					for the man who contributed one mina to have a share whether of the principal or
					of the profits accruing equal to the share of the man who supplied the whole of
					the remainder; but if on the other hand the state was formed not for the sake of
					life only but rather for the good life &lpar;for otherwise a collection of
					slaves or of lower animals would be a state, but as it is, it is not a state,
					because slaves<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1260a 12, and <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1177a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1177a 8</bibl>,
						&lsquo;but no one allows a slave any measure of happiness, any more than
						a life of his own.&rsquo;</note> and animals have no share in well-being
					or in purposive life&rpar;, and if its object is not military alliance for
					defence against injury by anybody, and it does not exist for the sake of trade
					and of business relations<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The sentence here
						breaks off; The inference that should have formed its conclusion is given in
						5.15.</note>&mdash;for if so, Etruscans and Carthaginians and all the
					people that have commercial relations with one another would be virtually
					citizens of a single state; <milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>at all
					events they have agreements about imports and covenants as to abstaining from
					dishonesty and treaties of alliance for mutual defence; <milestone n="1280b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but they do not
					have officials common to them all appointed to enforce these covenants, but
					different officials with either party, nor yet does either party take any
					concern as to the proper moral character of the other, nor attempt to secure
					that nobody in the states under the covenant shall be dishonest or in any way
					immoral, but only that they shall not commit any wrong against each other. All
					those on the other hand who are concerned about good government do take civic
					virtue and vice into their purview. Thus it is also clear that any state that is
					truly so called and is not a state merely in name must pay attention to virtue;
					for otherwise the community becomes merely an alliance, differing only in
					locality from the other alliances, those of allies that live apart. And the law
					is a covenant or, in the phrase of the sophist Lycophron,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably a pupil of Gorgias, see 1275b 26 n.</note> a
					guarantee of men's just claims on one another, but it is not designed to make
					the citizens virtuous and just. <milestone n="5.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					that this is how the matter stands is manifest. For if one were actually to
					bring the sites of two cities together into one, so that the city-walls of
						<placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> and those of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> were contiguous, even so they
					would not be one city; nor would they if they enacted rights of intermarriage
					with each other, although intermarriage between citizens is one of the elements
					of community which are characteristic of states. And similarly even if certain
					people lived in separate places yet not so far apart as not to have intercourse,
					but had laws to prevent their wronging one another<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in their interchange of products&mdash; for instance, if
					one man were a carpenter, another a farmer, another a shoemaker and another
					something else of the kind,&mdash;and the whole population numbered ten
					thousand, but nevertheless they had no mutual dealings in anything else except
					such things as exchange of commodities and military alliance, even then this
					would still not be a state. <milestone n="5.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What
					then exactly is the reason for this? for clearly it is not because their
					intercourse is from a distance since even if they came together for intercourse
					of this sort &lpar;each nevertheless using his individual house as a
					city&rpar; and for one another's military aid against wrongful aggressors
					only, as under a defensive alliance, not even then would they seem to those who
					consider the matter carefully to constitute a state, if they associated on the
					same footing when they came together as they did when they were apart. It is
					manifest therefore that a state is not merely the sharing of a common locality
					for the purpose of preventing mutual injury and exchanging goods. These are
					necessary preconditions of a state's existence, yet nevertheless, even if all
					these conditions are present, that does not therefore make a state, but a state
					is a partnership of families and of clans in living well, and its object is a
					full and independent life. <milestone n="5.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>At the
					same time this will not be realized unless the partners do inhabit one and the
					same locality and practise intermarriage; this indeed is the reason why family
					relationships have arisen throughout the states, and brotherhoods and clubs for
					sacrificial rites and social recreations. But such organization is produced by
					the feeling of friendship, for friendship is the motive of social life;
					therefore, while the object of a state is the good life, these things are means
					to that end. And a state is the partnership of clans and villages in a full and
					independent life, <milestone n="1281a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which in our view constitutes a happy and noble
					life; the political fellowship must therefore be deemed to exist for the sake of
					noble actions, not merely for living in common. <milestone n="5.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence those who contribute most to such fellowship have a
					larger part in the state than those who are their equals or superiors in freedom
					and birth but not their equals in civic virtue, or than those who surpass them
					in wealth but are surpassed by them in virtue.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It
					is therefore clear from what has been said that all those who dispute about the
					forms of constitution assert a part of the just principle.<milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But it is a matter
					of question what ought to be the sovereign power in the state. Clearly it must
					be either the multitude, or the rich, or the good, or the one man who is best of
					all, or a tyrant. But all of these arrangements appear to involve disagreeable
					consequences. For instance, if the poor take advantage of their greater numbers
					to divide up the property of the rich, is not this unjust? No, it may be said,
					for it was a resolution made by the supreme authority in just form. Then what
					must be pronounced to be the extreme of injustice? And again, when everybody is
					taken into account, suppose the majority share out among themselves the property
					of the minority, it is manifest that they are destroying the state; but
					assuredly virtue does not destroy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>its
					possessor, and justice is not destructive of the state, so that it is clear that
					this principle also cannot be just. <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also it follows from it that all the actions done by a tyrant are just, for
					his use of force is based upon superior strength, as is the compulsion exerted
					by the multitude against the rich. But is it just that the minority and the rich
					should rule? Suppose therefore they also act in the same way and plunder and
					take away the property of the multitude, is this just? If it is, so also is the
					plunder of the rich by the multitude. It is clear therefore that all these
					things are bad and not just. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					ought the good to rule, and be in control of all classes? If so, then it follows
					that all the other classes will be dishonored,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The term is technical and means disfranchisement and loss of
						civic rights.</note> if they are not honored by holding the offices of
					government; for we speak of offices as honors, and if the same persons are
					always in office the rest must necessarily be excluded from honor. But is it
					better for the most virtuous individual to be the ruler? But that is still more
					oligarchical, for the people excluded from honor will be more numerous. But
					perhaps some one would say that in any case it is a bad thing for a human being,
					having in his soul the passions that are the attributes of humanity, to be
					sovereign, and not the law. Suppose therefore that law is sovereign, but law of
					an oligarchic or democratic nature, what difference will it make as regards the
					difficulties that have been raised? for the results described before will come
					about just the same.<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Most of these points therefore must be discussed on
					another occasion; but the view that it is more proper for the multitude to be
					sovereign than the few of greatest virtue might be thought to be explicable and
					to have some justification, and even to be the true view. For it is possible
					that the many, though not individually good men, <milestone n="1281b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>yet when they come
					together may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are
					so, just as public dinners to which many contribute are better than those
					supplied at one man's cost; for where there are many, each individual, it may be
					argued, has some portion of virtue and wisdom, and when they have come together,
					just as the multitude becomes a single man with many feet and many hands and
					many senses, so also it becomes one personality as regards the moral and
					intellectual faculties. This is why the general public is a better judge of the
					works of music and those of the poets, because different men can judge a
					different part of the performance, and all of them all of it. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the superiority of good men over the mass of
					men individually, like that of handsome men, so it is said, over plain men and
					of the works of the painter's art over the real objects, really consists in
					this, that a number of scattered good points have been collected together into
					one example; since if the features be taken separately, the eye of one real
					person is more beautiful than that of the man in the picture, and some other
					feature of somebody else. It is not indeed clear whether this collective
					superiority of the many compared with the few good men can possibly exist in
					regard to every democracy and every multitude, and perhaps it may be urged that
					it is manifestly impossible in the case of some&mdash;for the same argument
					would also apply to animals, yet what difference is there,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>practically, between some multitudes and
					animals?&mdash;but nothing prevents what has been said from being true about
					some particular multitude. <milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>One might
					therefore employ these considerations to solve not only the previously stated
					difficulty but also the related question, over what matters is the authority of
					the freemen, the mass of the citizens, to extend &lpar;using that expression
					to denote those who are not rich nor possessed of any distinguishing excellence
					at all&rpar;? For it is not safe for them to participate in the highest
					offices &lpar;for injustice and folly would inevitably cause them to act
					unjustly in some things and to make mistakes in others&rpar;, but yet not to
					admit them and for them not to participate is an alarming situation, for when
					there are a number of persons without political honors and in poverty, the city
					then is bound to be full of enemies. It remains therefore for them to share the
					deliberative and judicial functions. <milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this reason Solon and certain other lawgivers appoint the common citizens
						to<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably words meaning
						&lsquo;these functions and to&rsquo; have fallen out.</note> the
					election of the magistrates and the function of calling them to audit, although
					they do not allow them to hold office singly. For all when assembled together
					have sufficient discernment, and by mingling with the better class are of
					benefit to the state, just as impure food mixed with what is pure makes the
					whole more nourishing than the small amount of pure food alone; but separately
					the individual is immature in judgement. <milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This arrangement of the constitution is however open to
					question in the first place on the ground that it might be held that the best
					man to judge which physician has given the right treatment is the man that is
					himself capable of treating and curing the patient of his present disease, and
					this is the man who is himself a physician; <milestone n="1282a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that this is the case
					similarly with regard to the other arts and crafts. Hence just as a court of
					physicians must judge the work of a physician, so also all other practitioners
					ought to be called to account before their fellows. But
					&lsquo;physician&rsquo; means both the ordinary practitioner, and the
					master of the craft, and thirdly, the man who has studied medicine as part of
					his general education &lpar;for in almost all the arts there are some such
					students, and we assign the right of judgement just as much to cultivated
					amateurs as to experts&rpar;. <milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further the same might be thought to hold good also of the election of
					officials, for to elect rightly is a task for experts&mdash;for example, it
					is for experts in the science of mensuration to elect a land-surveyor and for
					experts in navigation to choose a pilot; for even though in some occupations and
					arts some laymen also have a voice in appointments, yet they certainly do not
					have more voice than the experts. Hence according to this argument the masses
					should not be put in control over either the election of magistrates or their
					audit. <milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But perhaps this statement
					is not entirely correct, both for the reason stated above,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 6.4.</note> in case the populace is not of too slavish a
					character &lpar;for although each individual separately will be a worse
					judge than the experts, the whole of them assembled together will be better or
					at least as good judges&rpar;, and also because about some things the man
					who made them would not be the only nor the best judge, in the case of
					professionals whose products come within the knowledge of laymen also:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to judge a house, for instance, does not
					belong only to the man who built it, but in fact the man who uses the house
					&lpar;that is, the householder&rpar; will be an even better judge of it,
					and a steersman judges a rudder better than a carpenter, and the diner judges a
					banquet better than the cook.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This difficulty then
					might perhaps be thought to be satisfactorily solved in this way. <milestone n="6.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is another connected with it: it
					is thought to be absurd that the base should be in control over more important
					matters than the respectable; but the audits and the elections of magistrates
					are a very important matter, yet in some constitutions, as has been said, they
					are assigned to the common people, for all such matters are under the control of
					the assembly, yet persons of a low property-assessment and of any age take part
					in the assembly and the council and sit on juries, whereas treasury officials,
					generals and the holders of the highest magistracies are drawn from among
					persons of large property. <milestone n="6.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now this
					difficulty also may be solved in a similar way; for perhaps these regulations
					also are sound, since it is not the individual juryman or councillor or member
					of the assembly in whom authority rests, but the court, the council and the
					people, while each of the individuals named &lpar;I mean the councillor, the
					members of assembly and the juryman&rpar; is a part of those bodies. Hence
					justly the multitude is sovereign in greater matters, for the popular assembly,
					the council and the jury-court are formed of a number of people, and also the
					assessed property of all these members collectively is more than that of the
					magistrates holding great offices individually or in small groups.<milestone n="6.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let these
					points therefore be decided in this manner. <milestone n="1282b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But the difficulty first
						mentioned<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz. that in whatever class
						sovereignty is vested, some hardships will result, 1281a 14 ff.</note>
					proves nothing else so clearly as that it is proper for the laws when rightly
					laid down to be sovereign, while the ruler or rulers in office should have
					supreme powers over matters as to which the laws are quite unable to pronounce
					with precision because of the difficulty of making a general rule to cover all
					cases. We have not however yet ascertained at all what particular character a
					code of laws correctly laid down ought to possess, but the difficulty raised at
					the start<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1281a 36.</note> still
						remains;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably this clause should

					are bound to be adapted to the constitution&rpar;; yet if so, it is clear
					that the laws in conformity with the right constitutions must necessarily be
					just and those in conformity with the divergent<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The usual rendering is &lsquo;perverted,&rsquo; but

						unjust.<milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">What follows is a summary
						of <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1103a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 2</bibl>.</note>And
					inasmuch as in all the sciences and arts the End is a good, and the greatest
					good and good in the highest degree in the most authoritative of all, which is
					the political faculty, and the good in the political field, that is, the general
					advantage, is justice, it is therefore thought by all men that justice is some
					sort of equality, and up to a certain point at all events they agree with the
					philosophical discourses in which<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>conclusions have been reached about questions of ethics<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See also <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1131a">Aristot. Nic.
							Eth. 5.3</bibl>.</note>; for justice is a quality of a thing in relation
					to persons,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally, &lsquo;the just is
						&lpar;a just&rpar; something and &lpar;something just&rpar;
						for somebody.&rsquo;</note> and they hold that for persons that are
					equal the thing must be equal. But equality in what characteristics does this
					mean, and inequality in what? This must be made clear, since this too raises a
					difficulty, and calls for political philosophy. <milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For perhaps someone might say that the offices of state
					ought to be distributed unequally according to superiority in every good
					quality, even if the candidates in all other respects did not differ at all but
					were exactly alike, because men that are different<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. different in some good quality.</note> have different
					rights and merits. Yet if this is true, those who are superior in complexion or
					stature or any good quality will have an advantage in respect of political
					rights. But surely the error here is obvious, and it comes out clearly if we
					consider the other sciences and faculties. Among flute-players equally good at
					their art it is not proper to give an advantage in respect of the flutes to
					those of better birth, for they will not play any better, but it is the superior
					performers who ought to be given the superior instruments. <milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if our meaning is not yet plain, it will become
					still clearer when we have carried the matter further. Suppose someone is
					superior in playing the flute but much inferior in birth or in good looks, then,
					even granting that each of these things&mdash;birth and beauty&mdash;is
					a greater good than ability to play the flute, and even though they surpass
					flute-playing proportionately more than the best flute-player surpasses the
					others in flute-playing, even so the best flute-player ought to be given the
					outstandingly good flutes; <milestone n="1283a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for otherwise superiority both in wealth and in
					birth ought to contribute to the excellence of the performance, but they do not
					do so at all. <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover on this
					theory every good thing would be commensurable with every other. For if to be of
					some particular height gave more claim, then height in general would be in
					competition with wealth and with free birth; therefore if A excels in height
					more than B does in virtue, and speaking generally size gives more superiority
					than virtue,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps we should rewrite the
						Greek to give &lsquo;even though speaking generally virtue gives more
						superiority than size.&rsquo;</note> all things would be commensurable
					for; if such-and-such an amount of one thing is better than such-and-such an
					amount of another, it is clear that such-and-such an amount of the one is equal
					to that amount of another. <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But since
					this is impossible, it is clear that in politics with good reason men do not
					claim a right to office on the ground of inequality of every kind&mdash;if
					one set of men are slow runners and another fast, this is no good ground for the
					one set having more and the other less<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Doubtless the author meant the other way round, &lsquo;for the slow
						having less and the fast more political power.&rsquo;</note> political
					power, but the latter's superiority receives its honor in athletic contests; but
					the claim to office must necessarily be based on superiority in those things
					which go to the making of the state. Hence it is reasonable for the well-born,
					free and wealthy to lay claim to honor; for there must be free men and
					tax-payers, since a state consisting entirely of poor men would not be a state,
					any more than one consisting of slaves. <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But then, granting there is need of these, it is clear
						that<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there is also need of justice
					and civic virtue, for these are also indispensable in the administration of a
					state; except that wealth and freedom are indispensable for a state's existence,
					whereas justice and civic virtue are indispensable for its good
						administration.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As a means therefore towards a
					state's existence all or at all events some of these factors would seem to make
					a good claim, although as means to a good life education and virtue would make
					the most just claim, as has been said also before. <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand since those who are equal in one thing
					only ought not to have equality in all things nor those unequal as regards one
					thing inequality in all, it follows that all these forms of constitution must be
					deviations. Now it has been said before that all make a claim that is in a
					manner just, though not all a claim that is absolutely just; the rich claiming
					because they have a larger share of the land, and the land is common property,
					and also as being for the most part more faithful to their covenants; the free
					and well-born as being closely connected together &lpar;for the better-born
					are citizens to a greater degree than those of claims, low birth, and good birth
					is in every community held in honor at home&rpar;, and also because it is
					probable that the children of better parents will be better, for good birth
					means goodness of breed; <milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and we
					shall admit that virtue also makes an equally just claim, for we hold that
					justice is social virtue, which necessarily brings all the other virtues in its
					train; but moreover the majority have a just claim as compared with the
					minority, since they are stronger and richer and better if their superior
					numbers are taken in comparison with the others' inferior numbers. Therefore
					supposing all were in one city, <milestone n="1283b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>I mean, that is, the good and the wealthy and
					noble and also an additional mass of citizens, will there be a dispute, or will
					there not, as to who ought to govern? <milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is true that under each of the forms of constitution that have been
					mentioned the decision as to who ought to govern is undisputed &lpar;for the
					difference between them lies in their sovereign classes&mdash;one is
					distinguished by being governed by the rich men, one by being governed by the
					good men, and similarly each of the others&rpar;; but nevertheless we are
					considering the question how we are to decide between these classes supposing
					that they all exist in the state at the same period.<milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>If then the possessors of
					virtue should be quite few in number, how is the decision to be made? ought we
					to consider their fewness in relation to the task, and whether they are able to
					administer the state, or sufficiently numerous to constitute a state? And there
					is some difficulty as regards all the rival claimants to political honors. Those
					who claim to rule because of their wealth might seem to have no justice in their
					proposal, and similarly also those who claim on the score of birth; for it is
					clear that if, to go a step further, a single individual is richer than all the
					others together, according to the same principle of justice it will obviously be
					right for this one man to rule over all, and similarly the man of outstanding
					nobility among the claimants<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>on the
					score of free birth. <milestone n="7.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And this same
					thing will perhaps result in the case of aristocratic government based on
					virtue; for if there be some one man who is better than the other virtuous men
					in the state, by the same principle of justice that man must be sovereign.
					Accordingly if it is actually proper for the multitude to be sovereign because
					they are better than the few, then also, if one person or if more than one but
					fewer than the many are better than the rest, it would be proper for these
					rather than the multitude to be sovereign. <milestone n="7.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All these considerations therefore seem to prove the
					incorrectness of all of the standards on which men claim that they themselves
					shall govern and everybody else be governed by them. For surely even against
					those who claim to be sovereign over the government on account of virtue, and
					similarly against those who claim on account of wealth, the multitudes might be
					able to advance a just plea; for it is quite possible that at some time the
					multitude may be collectively better and richer than the few, although not
						individually.<milestone n="7.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hence it is also possible to meet in this way the question
					which some persons investigate and put forward &lpar;for some raise the
					question whether the legislator desiring to lay down the rightest laws should
					legislate with a view to the advantage of the better people or that of the
					larger number&rpar; in cases when the situation mentioned<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At the end of the last sentence, 7.12.</note>
					occurs. And &lsquo;right&rsquo; must be taken in the sense of
					&lsquo;equally right,&rsquo; and this means right in regard to the
					interest of the whole state and in regard to the common welfare of the citizens;
					and a citizen is in general one who shares in governing and being governed,
						<milestone n="1284a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>although he is different according to each form of
					constitution, but in relation to the best form a citizen is one who has the
					capacity and the will to be governed and to govern with a view to the life in
					accordance with virtue.<milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But if there is any one man so greatly distinguished in
					outstanding virtue, or more than one but not enough to be able to make up a
					complete state, so that the virtue of all the rest and their political ability
					is not comparable with that of the men mentioned, if they are several, or if
					one, with his alone, it is no longer proper to count these exceptional men a
					part of the state; for they will be treated unjustly if deemed worthy of equal
					status, being so widely unequal in virtue and in their political ability: since
					such a man will naturally be as a god among men. <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it is clear that legislation also must necessarily
					be concerned with persons who are equal in birth and in ability, but there can
					be no law dealing with such men as those described, for they are themselves a
					law; indeed a man would be ridiculous if he tried to legislate for them, for
					probably they would say what in the story of Antisthenes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Pupil of Socrates and founder of the Cynic sect of
						philosophers.</note> the lions said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Where are your claws and teeth?&rsquo;</note> when the hares
					made speeches in the assembly and demanded that all should have equality. This
					is why democratically governed states institute the system of ostracism, because
					of a reason of this nature; for these are the states considered to pursue
					equality most of all things,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so that
					they used to ostracize men thought to be outstandingly powerful on account of
					wealth or popularity or some other form of political strength, and used to
					banish them out of the city for fixed periods of time. <milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there is a mythical story that the Argonauts left
					Heracles behind for a similar reason; for the 
					Argo<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.19">Apollod. 1.9.19</bibl>
						<foreign lang="greek">th=s *)argou=s fqegcame/nhs mh\ du/nasqai pe/rein to\

						was a live creature, and Athena had built a &lsquo;talking

					others because he was so much heavier than the sailors. Hence also those who
					blame tyranny and Periander's advice to Thrasybulus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Periander was tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> circa <dateRange from="-626" to="-585">626</dateRange>-585 B.C.; Thrasybulus was tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>. <bibl n="Hdt. 5.92">Hdt.
							5.92</bibl> tells the story with their parts reversed.</note> must not
					be thought to be absolutely right in their censure &lpar;the story is that
					Periander made no reply to the herald sent to ask his advice, but levelled the
					corn-field by plucking off the ears that stood out above the rest; and
					consequently, although the herald did not know the reason for what was going on,
					when he carried back news of what had occurred, Thrasybulus understood that he
					was to destroy the outstanding citizens&rpar;; <milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for this policy is advantageous not only for tyrants, nor
					is it only tyrants that use it, but the same is the case with oligarchies and
					democracies as well; for ostracism has in a way the same effect as docking off
					the outstanding men by exile. And the same course is adopted in regard to cities
					and races by the holders of sovereign power, for example the Athenians so dealt
					with the Samians and Chians and Lesbians<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In
						440, 424 and <date value="-427">427</date> B.C. respectively</note>
					&lpar;for no sooner did they get a strong hold of their empire than they
					humbled them in contravention of their covenants&rpar;, <milestone n="1284b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the king of
					the Persians frequently used to cut down the numbers of the Medes and
					Babylonians and the other races that had waxed proud because they had once been
					head of an empire. <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the problem
					applies universally to all the forms of constitution, even the right forms; for
					while the divergent forms of government do this because their regard is fixed on
					their private advantage, nevertheless with the constitutions directed to the
					common good the same is the case. And this is also clear in the field of the
					other arts and sciences; a painter would not let his animal have its foot of
					disproportionately large size, even though it was an exceptionally beautiful
					foot, nor would a shipbuilder make the stern or some other part of a ship
					disproportionately big, nor yet will a trainer of choruses allow a man who sings
					louder and more beautifully than the whole band to be a member of it. <milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence as far as this practice goes nothing
					prevents monarchs from being in harmony with the cities they rule, if they
					resort to it when their own personal rule is beneficial to the cities. Therefore
					in relation to acknowledged superiorities the argument for ostracism has a
					certain element of political justice. True, it is better for the lawgiver so to
					constitute the state at the outset that it does not need this medicine; but the
					next best course to steer, if occasion arises, is to endeavor to
						correct<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the constitution by some
					such method of rectification. But this was not what happened with the states,
					for they were not looking at what was advantageous for their proper
					constitution, but their acts of ostracism were done in a revolutionary spirit.
					In the divergent forms of constitution therefore it is evident that ostracism is
					advantageous and just under the special constitution, though perhaps it is also
					evident that it is not<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps
						&lsquo;not&rsquo; should be struck out; but if it stands, the clause
						refers to 8.5 init.&mdash;in these cases ostracism is practiced only in
						the interest of those in power.</note> just absolutely; <milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in the case of the best constitution there is
					much doubt as to what ought to be done, not as regards superiority in the other
					things of value, such as strength and wealth and popularity, but in the case of
					a person becoming exceptionally distinguished for virtue. It certainly would not
					be said that such a man must be banished and got out of the way; yet
					nevertheless no doubt men would not think that they ought to rule over such a
					man, for that would be the same as if they claimed to rule over Zeus, dividing
					up his spheres of government. It remains therefore, and this seems to be the
					natural course, for all to obey such a man gladly, so that men of this sort may
					be kings in the cities for all time.<milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And perhaps it is well after the subjects
					that have been discussed to pass over to consider royal government; for we
					pronounce this to be one of the correct constitutions. And it has to be
					considered whether it is advantageous for a city or a country that is to be well
					administered to be ruled by a king, or whether it is not so but some other
					constitution is more expedient, or whether royal rule is expedient for some
					states and not for others. But it is needful to decide first whether there is
					only one sort of kingship or whether it has several varieties. <milestone n="1285a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it is at all events easy to discern that kingship includes several kinds,
					and that the mode of government is not the same in all. For the kingship in the
					Spartan constitution, which is held to be a typical royalty of the kind guided
					by law, does not carry sovereignty in all matters, though when a king goes on a
					foreign expedition he is the leader in all matters relating to the war; and also
					matters relating to religion have been assigned to the kings. This kingship
					therefore is a sort of military command vested in generals with absolute powers
					and held for life; for the king has not authority to put a subject to death,

					they govern according to law and are hereditary;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for because the barbarians are more servile in their nature

					law. <milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also their bodyguard is of a
					royal and not a tyrannical type for the same reason; for kings are guarded by
					the citizens in arms, whereas tyrants have foreign guards, for kings rule in
					accordance with law and over willing subjects, but tyrants rule over unwilling
					subjects, owing to which kings take their guards from among the citizens but
					tyrants have them to guard against the citizens. <milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These then are two kinds of monarchy; while another is

					it differs from the monarchy that exists among barbarians not in governing
					without the guidance of law but only in not being hereditary. Some holders of
					this type of monarchy ruled for life, others until certain fixed limits of time

					<milestone n="1285b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>These monarchies therefore now and in the past are of the nature of tyrannies
					because they are autocratic, but of the nature of kingships because they are
					elective and rule over willing subjects. <milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A fourth class of royal monarchy consists of the
					hereditary legal kingships over willing subjects in the heroic period. For
					because the first of the line had been benefactors of the multitude in the arts
					or in war, or through having drawn them together or provided them with land,
					these kings used to come to the throne with the consent of the subjects and hand
					it on to their successors by lineal descent. And they had supreme command in war
					and control over all sacrifices that were not in the hands of the priestly
					class, and in addition to these functions they were judges in law-suits; some
					gave judgement not on oath and some on oath&mdash;the oath was taken by
					holding up the sceptre.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This ritual is
						mentioned in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.234">Hom. Il. 1.234</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 7.412">Hom. Il. 7.412</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.328">Hom.

					<milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These kings then of ancient times
					used to govern continuously in matters within the city and in the country and
					across the frontiers; but later on when gradually the kings relinquished some of
					their powers and had others taken from them by the multitudes, in the cities in
					general only the sacrifices were left to the kings,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The monarchy was reduced to a priesthood at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> &lpar;<bibl n="Hdt. 4.161">Hdt.

					across the frontiers. <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There are
					then these kinds of kingship, four in number: one belonging to the heroic times,
					which was exercised over willing subjects, but in certain limited fields, for
					the king was general and judge and master of religious ceremonies; second, the
					barbarian monarchy, which is an hereditary despotism governing in conformity
					with law; third, the rule of the functionary called an <emph>aesymnetes</emph>,
					which is an elective tyranny; and fourth among these is the Spartan kingship,
					which may be described simply as an hereditary generalship held for life. These
					kingships then differ from one another in this manner. <milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But a fifth kind of kingship is when a single ruler
					is sovereign over all matters in the way in which each race and each city is
					sovereign over its common affairs; this monarchy ranges with the rule of a
					master over a household, for just as the master's rule is a sort of monarchy in
					the home, so absolute monarchy is domestic mastership over a city, or over a
					race or several races.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There are therefore, we may
					say, virtually two kinds of kingship that have been examined, this one and the
					Spartan. For most of the others lie between these, since with them the king is
					sovereign over fewer things than under absolute monarchy, but over more than
					under the Spartan kingship. Hence our inquiry is virtually about two questions,
					one whether it is expedient or inexpedient for states to have a military
					commander holding office for life, and that either by descent or by class,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some MSS. give &lsquo;or by
						election.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1286a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and one whether it is expedient or inexpedient for one man to be sovereign
					over everything. <milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now the study of a
					military command of the kind mentioned has more the aspect of a legal than of a
					constitutional inquiry &lpar;for it is possible for this form of office to
					exist under all constitutions&rpar;, so let it be dismissed at the first
						stage<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1289a 11 ff.; but the promise
						of a full discussion of law is not fulfilled</note>; but the remaining mode
					of kingship is a kind of constitution, so that it is necessary to consider this
					one and to run over the difficulties that it involves.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And the starting-point of the inquiry is the question whether
					it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best men or by the best laws.
						<milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those of the opinion that it is
					advantageous to be governed by a king think that laws enunciate only general
					principles but do not give directions for dealing with circumstances as they
					arise; so that in an art of any kind it is foolish to govern procedure by
					written rules &lpar;and indeed in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> physicians have the right to alter their prescription
					after four days, although if one of them alters it before he does so at his own
					risk&rpar;; it is clear therefore that government according to written
					rules, that is laws, is not the best, for the same reason. At the same time,
					however, rulers ought to be in possession of the general principle before
					mentioned as well. And a thing that does not contain the emotional element is
					generally superior to a thing in which it is innate; now the law does not
					possess this factor, but every human soul<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>necessarily has it. <milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But perhaps someone might say that in compensation for this a single ruler
					will decide better about particular cases. Therefore it is clear that on the one
					hand the ruler must necessarily be a legislator, and that there must or be laws
					laid down, although these must not be sovereign<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. unalterably binding, and not be set aside by special
						dispensation of the ruler when deemed to be unjust in some particular
						case.</note> where they go astray&mdash;admittedly in all other cases
					they ought to be sovereign; but on the other hand in matters which it is
					impossible for the law either to decide at all or to decide well, ought the one
					best man to govern or all the citizens? As it is, the citizens assembled hear
					lawsuits and deliberate and give judgements, but these judgements are all on
					particular cases. Now no doubt any one of them individually is inferior compared
					with the best man, but a state consists of a number of individuals, and just as
					a banquet to which many contribute dishes is finer than a single plain dinner,
					for this reason in many cases a crowd judges better than any single person.
						<milestone n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the multitude is more
					incorruptible&mdash;just as the larger stream of water is purer, so the mass
					of citizens is less corruptible than the few; and the individual's judgement is
					bound to be corrupted when he is overcome by anger or some other such emotion,
					whereas in the other case it is a difficult thing for all the people to be
					roused to anger and go wrong together. But the multitude must consist of the
					freemen, doing nothing apart from the law except about matters as to which the
					law must of necessity be deficient. And if this is not indeed easy to ensure in
					the case of many men, yet if there were a majority of good men and good
					citizens, would an individual make a more incorruptible ruler or rather those
					who though the majority in number yet are all good? <milestone n="1286b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The majority, is
					it not obvious? But it will be said that they will split up into factions,
					whereas with a single ruler this cannot happen. But against this must perhaps be
					set the fact that they are as virtuous in soul as the single ruler. <milestone n="10.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If then the rule of the majority when
					these are all good men is to be considered an aristocracy, and that of the one
					man kingship, aristocracy would be preferable for the states to kingship,
					whether the royal office be conjoined with military force or without it, if it
					be possible to get a larger number of men than one who are of similar quality.
					And it was perhaps only owing to this that kingships existed in earlier times,
					because it was rare to find men who greatly excelled in virtue, especially as in
					those days they dwelt in small cities. Moreover they used to appoint their kings
					on the ground of public service, and to perform this is a task for the good men.
					But as it began to come about that many men arose who were alike in respect of
					virtue, they would no longer submit to royalty, but sought for some form of
					commonwealth, and set up a republican constitution. <milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And as men becoming baser began to make money out of the
					community, it is reasonable to suppose that some such cause as this occasioned
					the rise of oligarchies; for they brought wealth into honor. And from
					oligarchies they first changed to tyrannies, and from tyrannies to democracy;
					for by constantly bringing the government into fewer hands owing to a base love
					of gain, they made the multitude stronger,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. more men of ability and position went over to the opposition.</note>
					so that it set upon the oligarchs, and democracies came into
						existence.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But now that the states
					have come to be even greater than they were, perhaps it is not easy for yet
					another form of constitution beside democracy to come into existence. <milestone n="10.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And even if one held that royal government
					is best for states, what is to be the position as regards the king's children?
					is the sovereignty to be hereditary? But this will be disastrous if the king's
					sons turn out to be like what some have been. It may be said that the king being
					sovereign will not in that case bequeath the throne to his children. But that is
					too much to be easy to believe: it would be difficult for a king to disinherit
					his sons, and an act of virtue above the level of human nature. <milestone n="10.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there is a difficulty also about the
					royal power: ought the man who is to reign as king to force to have an armed
					force about him, by means of which he will have power to compel those who may be
					unwilling to obey, or if not, how is it possible for him to administer his
					office? For even if he were a law-abiding sovereign and never acted according to
					his own will against the law, nevertheless it would be essential for him to have
					power behind him whereby to safeguard the laws. Probably therefore it is not
					difficult to define the regulations for a king of this sort: he must have a
					force of his own, but the force must be only so large as to be stronger than a
					single individual or even several individuals banded together, but weaker than
					the multitude, on the principle on which the men of old times used to assign
					bodyguards whenever they appointed somebody as what they termed
						<emph>aesymnetes</emph> or tyrant<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Or tyrant&rsquo; looks like an incorrect note, see 1285b
						25.</note> of the state, and also, when Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1259a 39 n.</note> asked for his guards, somebody advised
					him to give the same number of guards to the citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone n="1287a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="11.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Our
					discussion has now reached the case of the king who acts in all matters
					according to his own will, and we must examine this type of royalty. For the
					so-called constitutional monarchy, as we said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 10.3.</note> is not a special kind of constitution
					&lpar;since it is possible for a life-long generalship to exist under all
					constitutions, for example under a democracy and an aristocracy, and many people
					make one man sovereign over the administration, for instance there is a
					government of this sort in <placeName key="perseus,Epidamnos">Epidamnus</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
							Durazzo, on the Adriatic.</note> and also
					at Opus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Chief town of <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>, near the Straits of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName></note> to a certain smaller
					extent&rpar;; <milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but we have now
					to discuss what is called Absolute Monarchy, which is the monarchy under which
					the king governs all men according to his own will. Some people think that it is
					entirely contrary to nature for one person to be sovereign over all the citizens
					where the state consists of men who are alike; for necessarily persons alike in
					nature must in accordance with nature have the same principle of justice and the
					same value, so that inasmuch as for persons who are unequal to have an equal
					amount of food or clothing is harmful for their bodies, the same is the case
					also in regard to honors; <milestone n="11.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>similarly
					therefore it is wrong for those who are equal to have inequality, owing to which
					it is just for no one person to govern or be governed more than another, and
					therefore for everybody to govern and be governed alike in turn. And this
					constitutes law for regulation is law. Therefore it is preferable for the law to
					rule rather than any one of the citizens,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and according to this same principle, even if it be better for
					certain men to govern, they must be appointed as guardians of the laws and in
					subordination to them; for there must be some government, but it is clearly not
					just, men say, for one person to be governor when all the citizens are alike.
						<milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It may be objected that any
					case which the law appears to be unable to define, a human being also would be
					unable to decide. But the law first specially educates the magistrates for the
					purpose and then commissions them to decide and administer the matters that it
					leaves over &lsquo;according to the best of their judgement,&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This formula came in the oath taken by the
						dicasts at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> and
					furthermore it allows them to introduce for themselves any amendment that
					experience leads them to think better than the established code. He therefore
					that recommends that the law shall govern seems to recommend that God and reason
					alone shall govern, but he that would have man govern adds a wild animal also;
					for appetite is like a wild animal, and also passion warps the rule even of the
					best men. Therefore the law is wisdom without desire. <milestone n="11.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there seems to be no truth in the analogy which argues
					from the arts<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the practical sciences, of
						which medicine is taken as an example.</note> that it is a bad thing to
					doctor oneself by book, but preferable to employ the experts in the arts. For
					they never act contrary to principle from motives of friendship, but earn their
					fee when &lpar;for instance&rpar; they have cured their patients,
					whereas holders of political office usually do many things out of spite and to
					win favor; since when people suspect even the physicians of being in the
					confidence of their enemies and of trying to make away with them for gain, in
					that case they would sooner look up the treatment in the books. <milestone n="1287b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="11.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet certainly physicians
					themselves call in other physicians to treat them when they are ill, and
					gymnastic trainers put themselves under other trainers when they are doing
					exercises, believing that they are unable to judge truly because they are
					judging about their own cases and when they are under the influence of feeling.
					Hence it is clear that when men seek for what is just they seek for what is
					impartial; for<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps this should be
						&lsquo;and.&rsquo;</note> the law is that which is impartial. Again,
					customary laws<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the rules of duty and of
						manners that are customary but not embodied in legislation: cf. 1319b 40
						&lsquo;the laws both written and unwritten.&rsquo;</note> are more
					sovereign and deal with more sovereign matters than written laws, so that if a
					human ruler is less liable to error than written laws, yet he is not less liable
					to error than the laws of custom. <milestone n="11.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But also it is certainly not easy for the single ruler to oversee a multitude
					of things; it will therefore be necessary for the officials appointed by him to
					be numerous; so that what difference does it make whether this has been the
					arrangement immediately from the outset or the single ruler appoints them in
					this manner? Again, a thing that has also been said before, if the virtuous man
					justly deserves to rule because he is better, yet two good men are better than
					one: for that is the meaning of the line<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.224">Hom. Il. 10.224</bibl>: The passage goes on

					<quote type="verse">

					</quote> And even now the magistrates, like the Athenian dicast, have power to
					judge certain cases about which the law is unable to give a clear declaration,
					since nobody disputes that in matters about which it can do so the law would be
					the best ruler and judge. <milestone n="11.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					since, although some things can be covered by the laws,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>other things cannot, it is the latter that cause
					doubt and raise the question whether it is preferable for the best law to rule
					or the best man. For to lay down a law about things that are subjects for
					deliberation is an impossibility. Therefore men do not deny that it must be for
					a human being to judge about such matters, but they say that it ought not to be
					a single human being only but a number. For the individual official judges well
					when he has been instructed by the law, <milestone n="11.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and it would doubtless seem curious if a person saw better
					when judging with two eyes and two organs of hearing and acting with two feet
					and hands than many persons with many, since even as it is monarchs make many
					eyes and ears and hands and feet their own, for they adopt persons that are
					friendly to their rule and to themselves as their fellow-rulers. Although
					therefore if these assistants are not friendly they will not act in conformity
					with the monarch's policy, if they are friends of him and of his rule, well, a
					friend is one's equal and like, so that if the monarch thinks that his friends
					ought to rule he thinks that people who are equal to and like himself ought to
					rule like himself.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This then more or less is the
					case advanced by those who argue against kingship.<milestone n="11.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But perhaps, although this
					is a true account of the matter in some cases, it does not apply in others. For
					there is such a thing as being naturally fitted to be controlled by a master,
					and in another case, to be governed by a king, and in another, for citizenship,
					and this is just and expedient; but there is no such thing as natural fitness
					for tyranny, nor for any other of the forms of government that are divergences,
					for these come about against nature. <milestone n="1288a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But merely from what has been
					said, it is clear that among people who are alike and equal it is neither
					expedient nor just for one to be sovereign over all&mdash;neither when there
					are no laws, but he himself is in the place of law, nor when there are laws,
					neither when both sovereign and subjects are good nor when both are bad, nor yet
					when the sovereign is superior in virtue, except in a certain manner. What this
					manner is must be stated; and in a way it has been stated already even before.
						<milestone n="11.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But first we must define what
					constitutes fitness for royal government, what fitness for aristocracy, and what
					for a republic. A fit subject for royal government is a populace of such a sort
					as to be naturally capable of producing a family of outstanding excellence for
					political leadership; a community fit for aristocracy is one that naturally
					produces a populace<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The clause translated
						&lsquo;that&mdash;populace&rsquo; some editors excise as a
						superfluous insertion.</note> capable of being governed under the form of
					government fit for free men by those who are fitted by virtue for taking the
					part of leaders in constitutional government; a republican community, one in
					which there naturally grows up a military populace<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">They also excise &lsquo;in
						which-populace&rsquo;</note> capable of being governed and of governing
					under a law that distributes the offices among the well-to-do in accordance with
					merit. <milestone n="11.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>When therefore it comes
					about that there is either a whole family or even some one individual that
					differs from the other citizens in virtue so greatly that his virtue exceeds
					that of all the others, then it is just for this family to be the royal family
					or this individual king, and sovereign over all matters. For, as has been said
						before,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>this holds good not only
					in accordance with the right that is usually brought forward by those who are
					founding aristocratic and oligarchic constitutions, and from the other side by
					those who are founding democratic ones &lpar;for they all make their claim
					on the ground of superiority, though not the same superiority&rpar;, but it
					also holds good in accordance with the right spoken of before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the right of merit, 8.7.</note>
					<milestone n="11.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is not seemly to put to
					death or banish, nor yet obviously to ostracize, such a man, nor is it seemly to
					call upon him to take his turn as a subject; for it is not in the order of
					nature for the part to overtop the whole, but the man that is so exceptionally
					outstanding has come to overtop the whole community. Hence it only remains for
					the community to obey such a man, and for him to be sovereign not in turn but
						absolutely.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let this be our answer to the
					questions as regards kingship, what are its varieties, and whether it is
					disadvantageous for states or advantageous, and for what states, and under what
						conditions.<milestone n="12.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since we pronounce the right constitutions to be three, and
					of these the one governed by the best men must necessarily be the best, and such
					is the one in which it has come about either that some one man or a whole family
					or a group of men is superior in virtue to all the citizens together, the latter
					being able to be governed and the former to govern on the principles of the most
					desirable life, and since in the first part of the discourse<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 3.2, 3.</note> it was proved that the virtue of a man
					and that of a citizen in the best state must of necessity be the same, it is
					evident that a man becomes good in the same way and by the same means as one
					might establish an aristocratically or monarchically governed state,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be altered to give

					<milestone n="1288b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>so that it will be almost the

					ideal if no external circumstance stands in the way, and what constitution is
					adapted to what people &lpar;since for many it is doubtless impossible to
					attain the best one, so that the good lawgiver and the true statesman must be
					acquainted with both the form of constitution that is the highest absolutely and
					that which is best under assumed conditions&rpar;, and also thirdly the form
					of constitution based on a certain supposition &lpar;for he must be also
					capable of considering both how some given constitution could be brought into
					existence originally and also in what way having been brought into existence it
					could be preserved for the longest time: I mean for example if it has befallen
					some state not only not to possess the best constitution and to be unprovided
					even with the things necessary for it, but also not to have the constitution
					that is practicable under the circumstances but an inferior one&rpar;;
						<milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and beside all these matters he
					must ascertain the form of constitution most suited to all states, since most of
					those who make pronouncements about the constitution, even if the rest of what
					they say is good, entirely miss the points of practical utility. For it is
					proper to consider<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The fourfold
						classification given just before is repeated in rather loose terms in this
						sentence.</note> not only what is the best constitution but also what is the
					one possible of achievement, and likewise also what is the one that is easier
					and more generally shared by all states. But as it is, some students inquire
					which is the highest form of all even though requiring much material
						equipment,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word originally denoted
						the duty of the wealthy citizen holding office of Choregus to supply
						dresses, etc., for the chorus and actors in a drama.</note> while those who
					rather state some general form sweep aside the constitutions actually existing
					and praise that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> or some
					other; <milestone n="1289a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but the proper
					course is to bring forward an organization of such a sort that men will easily
					be persuaded and be able in the existing circumstances to take part in it, since
					to reform a constitution is no less a task than to frame one from the beginning,
					just as to re-learn a science is just as hard as to learn it originally; in
					addition therefore to the things mentioned the student of politics must also be
					able to render aid to the constitutions that exist already, as was also said
						before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 3.5.</note> But this is
					impossible if he does not know how many kinds of constitution there are; but at
					present some people think that there is only one kind of democracy and one kind
					of oligarchy, but this is not true. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence he must take in view the different varieties of the constitutions, and
					know how many there are and how many are their combinations. And after this it
					needs this same discrimination also to discern the laws that are the best, and
					those that are suited to each of the forms of constitution. For the laws should
					be laid down, and all people lay them down, to suit the
					constitutions&mdash;the constitutions must not be made to suit the laws; for
					a constitution is the regulation of the offices of the state in regard to the
					mode of their distribution and to the question what is the sovereign power in
					the state and what is the object of each community, but laws are distinct from
					the principles of the constitution, and regulate how the magistrates are to
					govern and to guard against those<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>who
					transgress them. <milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So that clearly it
					is necessary to be in possession of the different varieties of each form of
					constitution, and the number of these, even for the purpose of legislation; for
					it is impossible for the same laws to be expedient for all oligarchies or
					democracies if there are really several kinds of them, and not one sort of
					democracy or oligarchy only.<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And inasmuch as in our first inquiry<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 3.5.</note> about the forms of the
					constitution we classified the right constitutions as three, kingship,
					aristocracy and constitutional government, and the deviations from these as
					three, tyranny from kingship, oligarchy from aristocracy and democracy from
					constitutional government, and about aristocracy and kingship we have spoken
					&lpar;for to study the best constitution is the same thing as to speak about
					the forms that bear those names, since each of them means a system based on the
					qualification of virtue equipped with means&rpar;, and as also the question
					what constitutes the difference between aristocracy and kingship and when a
					royal government is to be adopted has been decided before, it remains to discuss
					the form of constitution designated by the name<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. <foreign lang="greek">politei/a</foreign>,
						&lsquo;polity,&rsquo; which denotes not only a constitution of any
						form, but also &lpar;like our term &lsquo;constitutional
						government&rsquo;&rpar; a particular form, viz., a republic, cf.
						Book 3.5.2.</note> common to them all, and the other forms, oligarchy,
					democracy and tyranny. <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now it is
					manifest also which of these deviations<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						three forms of constitution last mentioned.</note> is the worst and which
					the second worst. For necessarily the deviation from the first and most divine
					must be the worst,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><emph>Corruptio optimi
							pessima</emph>, a Socratic notion: &lsquo;the men of the best
						natural gifts, when educated, are the worst,&rsquo; <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 4.1.3">Xen. Mem. 4.1.3</bibl>.</note> and kingship must of
					necessity either possess the name only, without really being kingship,
						<milestone n="1289b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or be based on the outstanding superiority of the man who is
					king; so that tyranny being the worst form must be the one farthest removed from
					constitutional government, and oligarchy must be the second farthest
					&lpar;for aristocracy is widely separated from that constitution&rpar;,
					while democracy must be the most moderate. <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>An account of their relative merits has indeed already
					been given also by one of the former writers,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Stat. 302a">Plat. Stat. 302a ff.</bibl>
					</note> though not on the same principle as ours; for he inclined to judge that
					there were good varieties of all the forms, for instance a good sort of
					oligarchy and so on, and that democracy was the worst among these, but the best
					among the bad varieties, <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>whereas we
					say that the deviations are wholly wrong, and that it is not right to speak of
					one form of oligarchy as better than another, but only as less bad. But let us
					for the present dismiss the question of a classification of this nature. Our
					business is first to distinguish how many different forms of the constitutions
					there are, assuming that there do exist several kinds of democracy and of
					oligarchy; <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>next, which form is most
					general, and which most desirable after the best constitution, and also if there
					exists some other form that is aristocratic in nature and well constructed but
					not fitted to the largest number of cities, which this is; next, which of the
					other forms too is desirable for what people &lpar;since probably for some
					democracy is necessary more than oligarchy, and for others oligarchy more than
						democracy&rpar;;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and after
					this, in what way should one proceed who wishes to set up these constitutions, I
					mean the various forms of democracy and of oligarchy; and finally, when as far
					as possible we have concisely touched upon all these questions, we must endeavor
					to review what are the agencies that destroy and what are those that preserve
					constitutions generally and each variety of constitution in particular, and what
					are the causes by which it is most natural for these events to be brought
						about.<milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now the reason of there being several forms of constitution is
					that every city has a considerable number of parts. For in the first place we
					see that all the cities are composed of households, and then again that of this
					multitude some must necessarily be rich and some poor and some between the two,
					and also of the rich and the poor the former class is heavy-armed and the latter
					without armor. And we see that one portion of the common people is agricultural,
					another engaged in trade and another mechanic. And the upper classes have
					distinctions also corresponding to their wealth and the amounts of their
					property &lpar;for example in a stud of horses&mdash;for it is not easy
					to rear horses without being rich, <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and this is why in ancient times there were oligarchies in all the states
					whose strength lay in their cavalry, and they used to use horses for their wars
					against their neighbors, as for instance did the Eretrians and Chalcidians and
					the people of <placeName key="perseus,Magnesia ad Maeandrum">Magnesia</placeName> on the
						<placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName> and many of the other
					Asiatic peoples&rpar;. Moreover in addition to differences in wealth there
					is the difference of birth, and that in regard to virtue, <milestone n="1290a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and indeed any
					other similar distinction that in the discussion of aristocracy has been stated
					to constitute a part of the state &lpar;for there we distinguished how many
					necessary parts there are of which every state must consist&rpar;; for
					sometimes all of these parts participate in the constitution and sometimes a
					smaller or a larger number of them. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear therefore that there must necessarily be several forms of
					constitution differing in kind from one another, inasmuch as these parts differ
					in kind among themselves. For a constitution means the arrangement of the
					magistracies, and this all people plan out either according to the power of
					those who share political rights, or according to some common equality between
					them, I mean for example between the poor or between the rich, or some equality
					common to them both.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause looks like
						an interpolation.</note> It follows therefore that there are as many forms
					of constitution as there are modes of arrangement according to the superiorities
					and the differences of the sections. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the forms mostly are thought to be two&mdash;just as in the case of
					the winds we speak of some as north and some as south and regard the rest as
					deviations from these,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aristotle refers to
						this view in <bibl n="Aristot. Mete. 364a.19">Aristot. Meteor. 364a
							19</bibl>, saying that west winds are classed with north and east winds
						with south, because wind from the setting sun is cooler and from the rising
						sun warmer. He notes that north and south winds are the most frequent, <bibl n="Aristot. Mete. 361a.6">Aristot. Meteor. 361a 6</bibl>; this may have
						suggested the idea that they were the typical winds.</note> so also of
					constitutions there are held to be two forms, democracy and oligarchy; for men
					reckon aristocracy as a kind of oligarchy because it is oligarchy of a sort, and
					what is called constitutional government as democracy, just as in the case of
					the winds they reckon the west wind as a kind of north wind and the east wind as
					a kind of south wind.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And the case is
					similar with musical modes, as some people say: for there too they posit two
					kinds, the Dorian mode and the Phrygian, and call the other scales some of them
					Dorian and the others Phrygian. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					the most part therefore they are accustomed to think in this way about the
					constitutions; but it is truer and better to class them as we did, and assuming
					that there are two well-constructed forms, or else one, to say that the others
					are deviations, some from the well-blended constitution and the others from the
					best one, the more tense and masterful constitutions being oligarchic and the
					relaxed and soft ones demotic.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But it is not right to define democracy, as
					some people are in the custom of doing now, merely as the constitution in which
					the multitude is sovereign &lpar;for even in oligarchies and everywhere the
					majority is sovereign&rpar; nor oligarchy as the constitution in which a few
					are sovereign over the government. For if the whole number were thirteen
					hundred, and a thousand of these were rich and did not give the three hundred
					poor a share in the government although they were free-born and like themselves
					in all other respects, no one would say that this people was governed
					democratically; and similarly also if there were few poor, but these more
					powerful than the rich who were more numerous, no one would call such a
					government a democracy either, if the other citizens being rich had no share in
					the honors. <milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Rather therefore ought
					we to say that it is a democracy <milestone n="1290b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>when the free are sovereign and an oligarchy
					when the rich are, but that it comes about that the sovereign class in a
					democracy is numerous and that in an oligarchy small because there are many men
					of free birth and few rich. For otherwise, suppose people assigned the offices
					by height, as some persons<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g. <bibl n="Hdt. 3.20">Hdt. 3.20</bibl>.</note> say is done in <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>, or by beauty, that would be an
					oligarchy, because both the handsome and the tall are few in number. <milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nevertheless it is not enough to define
					these constitutions even by wealth and free birth only; but inasmuch as there
					are more elements than one both in democracy and in oligarchy, we must add the
					further distinction that neither is it a democracy if the free<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. those of citizen birth.</note> being few
					govern the majority who are not of free birth, as for instance at <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> on the Ionian Gulf and at
					<placeName key="perseus,Thera City">Thera</placeName> &lpar;for in each of
					these cities the offices of honor were filled by the specially noble families
					who had been the first settlers of the colonies, and these were few out of
					many&rpar;, nor is it a democracy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps
						the Greek should be altered here to give &lsquo;an
						oligarchy.&rsquo;</note> if the rich rule because they are in a
					majority, as in ancient times at <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName> &lpar;for there the majority of the population
					owned large property before the war against the Lydians took place&rpar;,
					but it is a democracy when those who are free are in the majority and have
					sovereignty over the government, and an oligarchy when the rich and more well
						born<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are few and sovereign.
						<milestone n="3.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It has then been stated that there are several forms of constitution, and what
					is the cause of this; but let us take the starting-point that was laid down
						before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 3.1.</note> and say that there
					are more forms than those mentioned, and what these forms are, and why they
					vary. For we agree that every state possesses not one part but several.
					Therefore just as, in case we intended to obtain a classification of animals, we
					should first define the properties necessarily belonging to every animal
					&lpar;for instance some of the sense organs, and the machinery for
					masticating and for receiving food, such as a mouth and a stomach, and in
					addition to these the locomotive organs of the various species&rpar;,
						<milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and if there were only so many
					necessary parts, but there were different varieties of these &lpar;I mean
					for instance certain various kinds of mouth and stomach and sensory organs, and
					also of the locomotive parts as well&rpar;, the number of possible
					combinations of these variations will necessarily produce a variety of kinds of
					animals &lpar;for it is not possible for the same animal to have several
					different sorts of mouth, nor similarly of ears either&rpar;, so that when
					all the possible combinations of these are taken they will all produce animal
					species, and there will be as many species of the animal as there are
					combinations of the necessary parts:&mdash;<milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>so in the same way also we shall classify the varieties of
					the constitutions that have been mentioned. For states also are composed not of
					one but of several parts, as has been said often. One of these parts therefore
					is the mass of persons concerned with food who are called farmers, <milestone n="1291a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					second is what is called the mechanic class &lpar;and this is the group
					engaged in the arts without which it is impossible for a city to be inhabited,
					and some of these arts are indispensably necessary, while others contribute to
					luxury or noble living&rpar;, and third is a commercial class &lpar;by
					which I mean the class that is engaged in selling and buying and in wholesale
					and retail trade&rpar;, and fourth is the class of manual laborers, and the
					fifth class is the one to defend the state in war, which is no less
					indispensable than the others if the people are not to become the slaves of
					those who come against them; for surely it is quite out of the question that it
					should be proper to give the name of state to a community that is by nature a
					slave, for a state is self-sufficient, but that which is a slave is not
					self-sufficient. <milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore the
					statement made in the <title>Republic</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 369b">Plat. Rep. 369b-371e</bibl>
					</note> is witty but not adequate. For Socrates says that the most necessary
					elements of which a state is composed are four, and he specifies these as a
					weaver, a farmer, a shoemaker and a builder; and then again he adds, on the
					ground that these are not self-sufficient, a copper-smith and the people to look
					after the necessary live-stock, and in addition a merchant and a retail trader.
					These elements together constitute the full complement of his first city,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the first sketch of the City-state, loc.
						cit.</note> implying that every city is formed for the sake of the
					necessaries of life and not rather for the sake of what is noble, and that it
					has equal need of both shoemakers and farmers; <milestone n="3.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but the warrior class<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>he does not assign to it until as the territory is increased
					and comes into contact with that of the neighbors they are brought into war. But
					yet even among the four partners or whatever their number be there must
					necessarily be somebody to assign justice and to judge their claims; inasmuch
					therefore as one would count the soul of an animal to be more a part of it than
					the body, so also the factors in states corresponding to the soul must be deemed
					to be parts of them more than those factors which contribute to necessary
					utility,&mdash;the former being the military class and the class that plays
					a part in judicial justice, and in addition to these the deliberative class,
					deliberation being a function of political intelligence. And it makes no
					difference to the argument whether these functions are held by special classes
					separately or by the same persons; <milestone n="3.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it often happens for the same men to be both soldiers and farmers. Hence
					inasmuch as both groups<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The first four
						classes and the fifth and sixth &lpar;the military and
						judicial&rpar;.</note> of classes must be counted parts of the state, it
					is clear that the heavy-armed soldiery at any rate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Lower grades of the forces may be excluded from citizenship,
						e.g. the rowers of the triremes &lpar;see below, 1376b
						15&rpar;.</note> must be a part of the state. And a seventh class is the
					one that serves the community by means of its property, the class that we call
					the rich. And an eighth is the class of public servants, that is, those who
					serve in the magistracies, inasmuch as without rulers it is impossible for a
					city to exist; it is therefore necessary that there should be some men who are
					able to govern and who render this service to the state either continuously or
					in turn. And there remain the classes which we happen to have defined just
					before, the deliberative class and the one that judges the claims of litigants.
					If therefore it is proper for the states to have these functions performed, and
					well and justly performed, <milestone n="1291b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is necessary for there also to be some men
					possessing virtue in the form of political excellence. <milestone n="3.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now as to the other capacities many people think
					that it is possible for them to be possessed in combination, for example, for
					the same men to be the soldiers that defend the state in war and the farmers
					that till the land and the artisans, and also the councillors and judges, and
					indeed all men claim to possess virtue and think themselves capable of filling
					most of the offices of state; but it is not possible for the same men to be poor
					and rich. Hence these seem to be in the fullest sense the parts of the state,
					the rich and the poor. And also the fact that the rich are usually few and the
					poor many makes these two among the parts of the state appear as opposite
					sections; so that the superior claims<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						3.11, 12 fin.</note> of these classes are even made the guiding principles
					upon which constitutions are constructed, and it is thought that there are two
					forms of constitution, democracy and oligarchy.<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That there are then several
					forms of constitution, and what are the reasons for this, has been stated
					before; let us now say that there are several varieties both of democracy and of
					oligarchy. And this is clear even from what has been said already. For there are
					several classes both of the people and of those called the notables; for
					instance classes of the people are, one the farmers, another the class dealing
					with the arts and crafts, another the commercial class<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>occupied in buying and selling and another the one
					occupied with the sea&mdash;and this is divided into the classes concerned
					with naval warfare, with trade, with ferrying passengers and with fishing
					&lpar;for each of these classes is extremely numerous in various places, for
					instance fishermen at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> and
						<placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, navy men at
						<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the mercantile class at
						<placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, and the ferryman-class at <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName>&rpar;, and in addition to
					these the hand-working class and the people possessing little substance so that
					they cannot live a life of leisure, also those that are not free men of citizen
					parentage on both sides, and any other similar class of common people; while
					among the notables wealth, birth, virtue, education, and the distinctions that
					are spoken of in the same group as these, form the classes.<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The first kind of
					democracy therefore is the one which receives the name chiefly in respect of
					equality. For the law of this sort of democracy ascribes equality to the state
					of things in which the poor have no more prominence than the rich, and neither
					class is sovereign, but both are alike; for assuming that freedom is chiefly
					found in a democracy, as some persons suppose, and also equality, this would be
					so most fully when to the fullest extent all alike share equally in the
					government. And since the people are in the majority, and a resolution passed by
					a majority is paramount, this must necessarily be a democracy. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This therefore is one kind of democracy,
					where the offices are held on property qualifications, but these low ones,
					although it is essential that the man who acquires the specified amount should
					have the right to hold office, and the man who loses it should not hold office.
						<milestone n="1292a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And another kind of democracy is for all the citizens that are
					not open to challenge<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. on the score of
						birth, cf. 5.4.</note> to have a share in office, but for the law to rule;
					and another kind of democracy is for all to share in the offices on the mere
					qualification of being a citizen, but for the law to rule. Another kind of
					democracy is where all the other regulations are the same, but the multitude is
					sovereign and not the law; <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and this
					comes about when the decrees of the assembly over-ride the law. This state of
					things is brought about by the demagogues; for in the states under democratic
					government guided by law a demagogue does not arise, but the best classes of
					citizens are in the most prominent position; but where the laws are not
					sovereign, then demagogues arise; for the common people become a single
					composite monarch, since the many are sovereign not as individuals but
					collectively. Yet what kind of democracy Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.204">Hom. Il. 2.204</bibl>
					</note> means by the words &lsquo;no blessing is the lordship of the
					many&rsquo;&mdash;whether he means this kind or when those who rule as
					individuals are more numerous, is not clear. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, a people of this sort, as being monarch, seeks to
					exercise monarchic rule through not being ruled by the law, and becomes
					despotic, so that flatterers are held in honor. And a democracy of this nature
					is comparable to the tyrannical form of monarchy, because their spirit is the
					same, and both exercise despotic control over the better classes, and the
					decrees voted by the assembly<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are like
					the commands issued in a tyranny, and the demagogues and the flatterers are the
					same people or a corresponding class, and either set has the very strongest
					influence with the respective ruling power, the flatterers with the tyrants and
					the demagogues with democracies of this kind. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And these men cause the resolutions of the assembly to be
					supreme and not the laws, by referring all things to the people; for they owe
					their rise to greatness to the fact that the people is sovereign over all things
					while they are sovereign over the opinion of the people, for the multitude
					believes them. Moreover those who bring charges against the magistrates say that
					the people ought to judge the suits, and the people receive the invitation
					gladly, so that all the magistracies are put down. <milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it would seem to be a reasonable criticism to say that
					such a democracy is not a constitution at all; for where the laws do not govern
					there is no constitution, as the law ought to govern all things while the
					magistrates control particulars, and we ought to judge this to be constitutional
					government; if then democracy really is one of the forms of constitution, it is
					manifest that an organization of this kind, in which all things are administered
					by resolutions of the assembly, is not even a democracy in the proper sense, for
					it is impossible for a voted resolution to be a universal rule.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let this be our discussion of the different kinds of
						democracy.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Of the kinds of oligarchy, one is for the magistracies to be
					appointed from property-assessments so high that the poor who are the majority
					have no share in the government, but for the man who acquires the requisite
					amount of property to be allowed to take part in it; <milestone n="1292b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>another is when
					the magistracies are filled from high assessments and the magistrates themselves
					elect to fill vacancies &lpar;so that if they do so from all the citizens of
					this assessment, this appears rather to be of the nature of an aristocracy, but
					if from a particular section of them, it is oligarchical&rpar;; another
					variety of oligarchy is when son succeeds father in office; and a fourth kind is
					when the hereditary system just mentioned exists and also the magistrates govern
					and not the law. This among oligarchies is the form corresponding to tyranny
					among monarchies and to the form of democracy about which we spoke last among
					democracies, and indeed oligarchy of this sort has the special name of
						dynasty.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Government controlled by a few
						powerful families. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.62.4">Thuc. 3.62.4</bibl>, where the
						Thebans say, &lsquo;In those days our state was not governed by an
						oligarchy that granted equal justice to all, nor yet by a democracy; the
						power was in the hands of a small cabal &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">dunastei/a o)li/gwn a)ndrw=n</foreign>&rpar;, than which nothing is
						more opposed to law or to true political order, or more nearly resembles a
						tyranny&rsquo; &lpar;Jowett&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So
					many therefore are the kinds of oligarchy and of democracy; but it must not
					escape notice that in many places it has come about that although the
					constitution as framed by the laws is not democratic, yet owing to custom and
					the social system it is democratically administered, and similarly by a reverse
					process in other states although the legal constitution is more democratic, yet
					by means of the social system and customs it is carried on rather as an
					oligarchy. This occurs chiefly after alterations of the constitutions have taken
					place; for the people do not change over to the new system immediately but are
					content at the first stages to gain small advantages from the other
						party,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so that the previously
					existing laws continue although power is in the hands of the party that is
					changing the constitution.<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And that these various kinds of democracy and oligarchy
					exist is manifest from the actual things that have been said. For necessarily
					either all the parts of the population that have been mentioned must have a
					share in the government, or some and not others. When therefore the farmer class
					and the class possessed of moderate property is sovereign over the government,
					they govern according to laws; for they have a livelihood if they work, but are
					not able to be at leisure, so that they put the law in control and hold the
					minimum of assemblies necessary; and the other persons have the right to take
					part when they have acquired the property-assessment fixed by the laws, so that
					to take part in the government is open to all who have got that amount of
					property; since for it not to be open to everybody on any terms at all is a
					characteristic of oligarchy, but then on the other hand it is impossible for it
					to be open to them to have leisure if there are no revenues.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. revenues from abroad; the poor can only attend often if
						paid for attendance, and this can only be financed if the state has income
						from tribute or foreign property.</note> This then is one kind of democracy
					for these reasons. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Another kind is
					due to the distinction that comes next: it is possible that all the citizens not
					liable to objection on the score of birth may have the right to take part in the
					assembly, but may actually take part only when they are able to be at leisure;
					hence in a democracy of this nature the laws govern because there is no revenue.
					A third kind is when all those who are free men have the right to take part in
					the government yet do not do so because of the aforesaid reason, so that it
					follows that in this form of democracy also the law governs. <milestone n="1293a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And a fourth kind of democracy
					is the one that has been the last in point of time to come into existence in the
					states. Because the states have become much greater than the original ones and
					possess large supplies of revenue, while all the citizens have a share in the
					government because of the superiority<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						1288a 20 ff.</note> of the multitude, all actually take part in it and
					exercise their citizenship because even the poor are enabled to be at leisure by
					receiving pay. Indeed the multitude in this kind of state has a very great deal
					of leisure, for they are not hampered at all by the care of their private
					affairs, but the rich are, so that often they take no part in the assembly nor
					in judging lawsuits. Owing to this the multitude of the poor becomes sovereign
					over the government, instead of the laws. Such in number and in nature are the
					kinds of democracy that these causes necessarily bring into existence.
						<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To turn to the varieties and of
					oligarchy, when more men possess property, but less of it and not a very large
					amount, this is the first form of oligarchy; for they allow the man that
					acquires property the right to participate, and because there is a large number
					of persons participating in the government it necessarily follows that not the
					men but the law is sovereign &lpar;for the farther removed they are from
					monarchy, and as they have not so much property as to be idle and neglect it,
					nor yet so little as to be kept at the expense of the state,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they are compelled to call upon the law to rule
					instead of ruling themselves&rpar;. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But then if the owners of the properties are fewer than
					those who owned them previously, and own more, the second form of oligarchy
					comes into being; for as they become stronger they claim to have a larger share,
					and therefore they themselves select those from among the rest of the citizens
					who go into the government, but as they are not yet strong enough to rule
					without law they make the law conform with this.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. they legalize the recruiting of the ruling class by
						co-optation; or the words may mean &lsquo;they make the law
						ruler.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if they carry matters further by
					becoming fewer and holding larger properties, there comes about the third
					advance in oligarchy, which consists in their keeping the offices in their own
					hands, but under a law enacting that they are to be hereditary. And when finally
					they attain very great pre-eminence by their wealth and their multitude of
					friends, a dynasty of this nature is near to monarchy, and men become supreme
					instead of the law; and this is the fourth kind of oligarchy, the counterpart of
					the last kind of democracy.<milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Furthermore<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">We now pass from the varieties of Oligarchy and of Democracy
						to those of the other actually existing constitutions, Aristocracy so-called
						and Constitutional Government.</note> there are two constitutions by the
					side of democracy and oligarchy, one<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.
						aristocracy.</note> of which is counted by everybody and has been referred
					to as one of the four forms of constitution &lpar;and the four meant are
					monarchy, oligarchy, democracy and fourth the form called aristocracy&rpar;,
					but there is a fifth, entitled by the common name of them all &lpar;for it
					is called constitutional government&rpar;, but as it does not often occur it
					is overlooked by those who try to enumerate the forms of constitution, and they
					use the four names only &lpar;as does Plato&rpar; in the list of
					constitutions. <milestone n="1293b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now the name of
					aristocracy is indeed properly given to the constitution that we discussed in
					our first discourses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 3. 1279a 35 ff.,
						1286b 3 ff.</note> &lpar;for it is right to apply the name
					&lsquo;aristocracy&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;government of the
					best&rsquo;&mdash;only to the constitution of which the citizens are
					best in virtue absolutely and not merely good men in relation to some arbitrary
					standard, for under it alone the same person is a good man and a good citizen
					absolutely, whereas those who are good under the other constitutions are good
					relatively to their own form of constitution&rpar;; nevertheless there are
					also some constitutions that have differences both in comparison with
					oligarchically governed states and with what is termed constitutional
					government, inasmuch as in them they elect the officials not only by wealth but
					also by goodness; <milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>this form of
					constitution differs from both and is called aristocratic. For even in the
					states that do not pay any public attention to virtue there are nevertheless
					some men that are held in high esteem and are thought worthy of respect. Where
					then the constitution takes in view wealth and virtue as well as the common
					people, as for instance at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, this is of the nature of an aristocracy; and so also
					are the states, in which the constitution, like that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, takes in view two of these things
					only, virtue and the common people, and there is a mingling of these two
					factors, democracy and virtue. These then are two kinds of aristocracy beside
					the first, which is the best constitution,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and a third kind is those instances of what is called
					constitutional government that incline more in the direction of
						oligarchy.<milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It remains for us to speak about what is termed constitutional
					government and also about tyranny. Though neither the former nor the
					aristocracies spoken of just now are really deviations, we have classed them
					thus because in actual truth they have all fallen away from the most correct
					constitution, and consequently are counted with the deviation-forms, and those
					are deviations from them, as we said in our remarks at the beginning.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1279b 4 ff. Actual aristocracies are a
						falling-off from the Aristocracy and Polity is a decline from Monarchy and
						Aristocracy; but they are not deviations in the technical sense.</note>
					Tyranny is reasonably mentioned last because it is the least constitutional of
					all governments, whereas our investigation is about constitutional
						government.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Having then stated the reason for
					this mode of classification, we have now to set forth our view about
					constitutional government. <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For its
					meaning is clearer now that the characteristics of oligarchy and democracy have
					been defined; since constitutional government is, to put it simply, a mixture of
					oligarchy and democracy. But people customarily give the name of constitutional
					government only to those among such mixed constitutions that incline towards
					democracy, and entitle those that incline more towards oligarchy aristocracies,
					because education and good birth go more with the wealthier classes, and also
					the wealthy are thought to have already the things to get which wrongdoers
					commit wrong; owing to which people apply the terms &lsquo;gentry&rsquo;
					and &lsquo;notabilities&rsquo; to the rich. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since therefore aristocracy means the assignment of the
					highest place to the best of the citizens, oligarchies also are said to be drawn
					rather from the gentry. <milestone n="1294a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And it seems an impossibility for a city governed
					not by the aristocracy but by the base to have well-ordered government, and
					similarly also for a city that has not a well-ordered government to be governed
					aristocratically. But to have good laws enacted but not obey them does not
					constitute well-ordered government. Hence one form of good government must be
					understood to consist in the laws enacted being obeyed, and another form in the
					laws which the citizens keep being well enacted &lpar;for it is possible to
					obey badly enacted laws&rpar;. And for laws to be well enacted is possible
					in two ways: they must either be the best laws possible for the given people or
					the best absolutely. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But aristocracy
					in the fullest sense seems to consist in the distribution of the honors
					according to virtue; for virtue is the defining factor of aristocracy, as wealth
					is of oligarchy, and freedom of democracy &lpar;while the principle that a
					decision of the majority is supreme is found in them all: for in both oligarchy
					and aristocracy and democracies whatever the larger part of those who have a
					share in the government decides is supreme&rpar;. In most states<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in most states that are considered
						aristocracies.</note> then the name of aristocracy is given to that form of
					constitutional government,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the more
						oligarchical form, 1293b 36.</note> for the combination aims only at the
					well-off and the poor, wealth and freedom &lpar;since in almost the largest
					number of states the rich seem to occupy the place of the gentry&rpar;;
						<milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but as there are three things
					that claim equal participation<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the
					constitution, freedom, wealth and virtue &lpar;for the fourth, what is
					called nobility, accompanies the two latter&mdash;nobility means ancient
					wealth and virtue&rpar;, it is manifest that the mixture of the two factors,
					the rich and the poor,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Loosely put for
						&lsquo;wealth and free birth.&rsquo;</note> ought to be termed
					constitutional government, while the mixture of the three factors deserves the
					name of aristocracy most of all the various forms of aristocracy beside the true
					and best form.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It has then been stated that other
					forms of constitution also exist besides monarchy, democracy and oligarchy, and
					what their characteristics are, and how the various sorts of aristocracy and of
					constitutional government differ from one another; and it is manifest that
					aristocracy and constitutional government are not widely apart from one
						another.<milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Next to what has been said let us state the way in which what
					is called constitutional government comes into existence by the side of
					democracy and oligarchy, and how it is proper to establish it. At the same time
					the defining characteristics of democracy and oligarchy will also be clear; for
					we must grasp the distinction between these and then make a combination out of
					them, taking, so to say, a contribution from each. And there are three
					principles determining this combination or mixture. <milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Under one plan we must adopt both features from the
					legislative schemes of the two different constitutions: for example, in regard
					to the administration of justice, in oligarchies they institute a fine for the
					rich if they do not serve on juries but no pay for the poor for serving, while
					in democracies they assign pay for the poor but no fine for the rich, but a
					common and intermediate principle is to have both payment and fine, and
					therefore this is a mark of a constitutional government, since it is a mixture
					of elements from both oligarchy and democracy. <milestone n="1294b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This then is one mode of combining the two. Another
					is to take the middle course between the regulations of each: for example,
					democracies permit membership of the assembly on no property-qualification at
					all or a quite small one, oligarchies on a large property-qualification, but the
					combination clearly is to have neither principle, but one which lies in the
					middle between either of these two qualifications. In the third place is a
					combination of the two systems, taking some features from the oligarchical law
					and some from the democratic; I mean, for example, that it is thought to be
					democratic for the offices to be assigned by lot, for them to be elected
					oligarchic, and democratic for them not to have a property-qualification,
					oligarchic to have one; therefore it is aristocratic and constitutional to take
					one feature from one form and the other from the other, from oligarchy that
					offices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a
					property-qualification. This then is the mode of the mixture; <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and
					oligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a
					democracy and as an oligarchy; for manifestly this is so when it is said because
					they have been mixed well, and this is the case with the form that lies in the
					middle, for each of the two extreme forms can be seen in it. <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is the case with the constitution of
						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. For many
						people<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>endeavor to describe it as
					being a democracy, because its system has many democratic features, for instance
					first of all its regulation for the rearing of boys, since the sons of the rich
					are brought up in the same way as those of the poor, and are educated in a
					manner in which the sons of the poor also could be educated, and they are also
					treated similarly at the next age, and in the same manner when they are grown
					up, for there is nothing that distinguishes the rich man from the poor
					man&mdash;thus the arrangements for food are the same for all at the common
					messes, and the rich wear clothes such as even any poor man could procure, and
					also because of the two greatest offices the common people elect to one and
					share in the other &lpar;they elect the Elders and share in the
					Ephorate&rpar;; but others call it an oligarchy, because it has many
					oligarchical features, for instance that all the offices are elective and none
					appointed by lot and few persons have the power to sentence to death and exile,
					and a number of other such matters. <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But in a well-constructed mixed constitution both of the two factors, and
					neither of them,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A conjectural emendation
						removes this mysterious epigram, giving &lsquo;and not one of the two
						&lpar;only&rpar;.&rsquo;</note> should seem to be present, and
					it should be kept safe by its own means and not by outside aid, and by its own
					means not because those who desire its security are more numerous outside
						it<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, if <foreign lang="greek">e)/cwqen</foreign> is an interpolation, &lsquo;not merely because
						those &lpar;citizens&rpar; who wish it to survive are more numerous
						&lpar;than those who do not&rpar;.&rsquo;</note> &lpar;for
					even a bad constitution might possess this quality&rpar;, but because no
					section of the state whatever would even wish for another
						constitution.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The proper way therefore to
					establish a constitutional government, and similarly also the governments named
					aristocracies, has now been stated. <milestone n="1295a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It remained for us to speak
					of tyranny, not because there is much that can be said about it, but in order
					that it may receive its part in our inquiry, since we rank this also as one
					among the kinds of constitution. The nature of kingship we have defined in our
					first discourses,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 3.9-12.</note> in
					which we examined the question in relation to the constitution most commonly
					denoted by the term &lsquo;kingship,&rsquo; whether it is
					disadvantageous or an advantage to states, <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and what person ought to be set up as king, and from what
					source, and by what procedure; and in the passage in which we were considering
					kingship we distinguished two kinds of tyranny, because their power in a manner
					borders upon royalty, because both these forms of rule are in accordance with
					law &lpar;for among some of the barbarians they elect monarchic rulers with
					autocratic powers, and also in old times among the ancient Greeks some men used
					to become monarchs of this sort, the rulers called
					<emph>aesymnetae</emph>&rpar;, but these two forms of tyranny have certain
					differences from one another, although they were on the one hand of the nature
					of royalty because they were in accordance with law and because they exercised
					monarchic rule over willing subjects, and on the other hand of the nature of a
					tyranny because they ruled despotically and according to their own judgement.
						<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is a third kind of
					tyranny which is thought to be tyranny in the fullest degree, being the
					counterpart of universal kingship; to this sort of tyranny must necessarily
					belong a monarchy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that exercises
					irresponsible rule over subjects all of the same or of a higher class with a
					view to its own private interest and not in the interest of the persons ruled.
					Hence it is held against the will of the subjects, since no free man willingly
					endures such rule.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These then are the kinds of
					tyranny and such is their number, for the reasons stated<milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But what is the best
					constitution and what is the best mode of life for most cities and most of
					mankind, if we do not judge by the standard of a virtue that is above the level
					of private citizens or of an education that needs natural gifts and means
					supplied by fortune, nor by the standard of the ideal constitution, but of a
					mode of life able to be shared by most men and a constitution possible for most
					states to attain? <milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the
					constitutions called aristocracies, of which we spoke just now,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1293b 7-21, cf. 1293b 36-1294a 25.</note>
					in some cases fall somewhat out of the scope of most states, and in others
					approximate to what is called constitutional government, so that it is proper to
					speak of these two forms as if they were one. And indeed the decision in regard
					to all these questions is based on the same elementary principles. For if it has
					been rightly said in the<title>Ethics</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1101a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1101a
						14</bibl>.</note> that the happy life is the life that is lived without
					impediment in accordance with virtue, and that virtue is a middle course, it
					necessarily follows that the middle course of life is the best&mdash;such a
					middle course as it is possible for each class of men to attain. <milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And these same criteria must also
					necessarily apply to the goodness and badness of a state, and of a
					constitution&mdash;for a constitution is a certain mode of life of a state.
						<milestone n="1295b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>In all states therefore there exist three divisions of the
					state, the very rich, the very poor, and thirdly those who are between the two.
					Since then it is admitted that what is moderate or in the middle is best, it is
					manifest that the middle amount of all of the good things of fortune is the best
					amount to possess. <milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this degree
					of wealth is the readiest to obey reason, whereas for a person who is
					exceedingly beautiful or strong or nobly born or rich, or the
					opposite&mdash;exceedingly poor or weak or of very mean station, it is
					difficult to follow the bidding of reason; for the former turn more to insolence
					and grand wickedness, and the latter overmuch to malice and petty wickedness,
					and the motive of all wrongdoing is either insolence or malice. And moreover the
					middle class are the least inclined to shun office and to covet office,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text is an emendation; some MSS. give
						&lsquo;to rule the tribe and to rule the council,&rsquo; but most
						have &lsquo;to love office and rule the council,&rsquo; apparently
						thinking that the verb translated &lsquo;rule the council&rsquo;
						meant &lsquo;wish office.&rsquo;</note> and both these tendencies
					are injurious to states. <milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in
					addition to these points, those who have an excess of fortune's goods, strength,
					wealth, friends and the like, are not willing to be governed and do not know how
					to be &lpar;and they have acquired this quality even in their boyhood from
					their homelife, which was so luxurious that they have not got used to submitting
					to authority even in school&rpar;, while those who are excessively in need
					of these things are too humble. Hence the latter class do not know how to govern
					but know how to submit to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>government
					of a servile kind, while the former class do not know how to submit to any
					government, and only know how to govern in the manner of a master. <milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The result is a state consisting of slaves
					and masters, not of free men, and of one class envious and another contemptuous
					of their fellows. This condition of affairs is very far removed from
					friendliness, and from political partnership&mdash;for friendliness is an
					element of partnership, since men are not willing to be partners with their
					enemies even on a journey. But surely the ideal of the state is to consist as
					much as possible of persons that are equal and alike, and this similarity is
					most found in the middle classes; therefore the middle-class state will
					necessarily be best constituted in respect of those elements<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably Lambinus's alteration of the Greek should be
						accepted, giving &lsquo;hence that state will necessarily be best
						governed which consists of those elements&mdash;.&rsquo;</note> of
					which we say that the state is by nature composed. <milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also this class of citizens have the greatest security
					in the states; for they do not themselves covet other men's goods as do the
					poor, nor do the other classes covet their substance as the poor covet that of
					the rich; and because they are neither plotted against nor plotting they live
					free from danger. Because of this it was a good prayer of Phocylides<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A gnomic poet of <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, born <date value="-560">560</date> B.C.</note>&mdash; <quote type="verse">
						<l met="dactylic">In many things the middle have the best;</l>
						<l>Be mine a middle station.</l>
					</quote>
					<milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear therefore also that the
					political community administered by the middle class is the best, and that it is
					possible for those states to be well governed that are of the kind in which the
					middle class is numerous, and preferably stronger than both the other two
					classes, or at all events than one of them, for by throwing in its weight it
					sways the balance and prevents the opposite extremes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. extreme democracy and very limited oligarchy.</note>
					from coming into existence. Hence it is the greatest good fortune if the men
					that have political power possess a moderate and sufficient substance,
						<milestone n="1296a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since where some own a very great deal of property and others
					none there comes about either an extreme democracy or an unmixed oligarchy, or a
					tyranny may result from both of the two extremes, for tyranny springs from both
					democracy and oligarchy of the most unbridled kind, but much less often from the
					middle forms of constitution and those near to them. The cause of this we will
					speak of later in our treatment of political revolutions. <milestone n="9.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That the middle form of constitution is the best is
					evident; for it alone is free from faction, since where the middle class is
					numerous, factions and party divisions among the citizens are least likely to
					occur. And the great states are more free from faction for the same reason,
					because the middle class is numerous, whereas in the small states it is easy to
					divide the whole people into two parties leaving nothing in between, and also
					almost everybody is needy or wealthy. Also democracies are more secure and more
					long-lived than oligarchies owing to the citizens of the middle class
					&lpar;for they are more numerous and have a larger share of the honors in
					democracies than in oligarchies&rpar;, since when the poor are in a majority
					without the middle class, adversity sets in and they are soon ruined. <milestone n="9.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it must be deemed a significant fact
					that the best lawgivers are from among the middle citizens; for Solon was of
					that class,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as appears from his
					poetry, and so was Lycurgus &lpar;for he was not a king&rpar; and
					Charondas and almost the greatest number of the other lawgivers.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And these considerations also show the reason why the
					constitutions of most states are either democratic or oligarchical; owing to the
					middle class in these states being often a small one, the classes diverging from
					the middle status&mdash;whichever of the two, the owners of the estates or
					the people, from time to time has the upper hand&mdash;conduct the
					government on their own lines, so that it becomes either a democracy or an
					oligarchy. <milestone n="9.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in addition to this,
					because factions occur and fights between the people and the wealthy, whichever
					party happens to gain the upper hand over its opponents does not establish a
					common or equal government, but takes the superior share in the government as a
					prize of victory, and makes it a democracy in the one case and an oligarchy in
					the other. Moreover each of the two states that in the past held the leadership
					of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> took as a pattern the form of
					government that existed among themselves and set up in the one case democracies
					and in the other oligarchies in the cities, not considering the interest of the
					cities but their own advantage. <milestone n="9.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence owing to these causes the middle form of constitution either never comes
					into existence or seldom and in few places; for one man<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is quite uncertain who is meant, possibly Solon or
						Theramenes.</note> only among the states that have formerly held the
					leadership was induced to grant this form of organization, and by this time it
					has become a fixed habit with the people of the separate cities also not even to
					desire equality, <milestone n="1296b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but either to seek to rule or to endure being under
					a master.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These considerations therefore make it
					clear which is the best constitution, and why it is the best; <milestone n="9.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and now that the best has been defined, it
					is not difficult to see, among the other forms of constitution
					&lpar;inasmuch as we pronounce that there are various forms of democracy and
					various oligarchies&rpar;, what kind is to be placed first, what second, and
					what next in this order, by reason of one being better and another worse. For at
					each stage the form nearest to the best one must necessarily be superior, and
					the form that is more remote from the middle must be inferior&mdash;unless
					one is judging relatively to given conditions: I make this reservation because
					it is quite possible that although one form of constitution is preferable it may
					often be more advantageous for certain people to have another form.<milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The next
					thing after what has been said is to discuss which constitution is advantageous
					for which people, and what sort of constitution for what sort of people. Now we
					must first grasp a general principle that applies equally to all sorts of
					constitution: it is essential that the part of the state that wishes the
					constitution to remain should be stronger than the part that does not wish it.
					But every state consists of both quality and quantity: by quality I mean
					freedom, wealth, education, good birth, and by quantity the superior numbers of
					the multitude. <milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is possible
						that,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>while the quality of the
					state belongs to one among the parts of which the state consists and its
					quantity to another part&mdash;for example the low-born may be more numerous
					than the noble or the poor than the rich, yet the more numerous class may not
					exceed in quantity as much as they fall behind in quality. Hence these two
					factors have to be judged in comparison with one another.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Where therefore the multitude of the poor exceeds in the
					proportion stated,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. so as to outbalance
						their inferiority in quality.</note> here it is natural for there to be
					democracy, and each kind of democracy in accordance with the superior number of
					the common people of each sort, for example if the number of the farming class
					exceeds, the first sort of democracy, but if that of the common laborers and
					wage-earners, the last sort, and similarly also with the other sorts that lie
					between these two; <milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but where the
					class of the well-to-do and notable exceeds in quality more than it falls behind
					in quantity, here it is natural for there to be an oligarchy, and likewise the
					various kinds of oligarchy according to the degree of superiority<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. superiority in quality.</note> of the
					oligarchical multitude.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word is loosely
						used of this small class.</note> But the lawgiver in his constitution must
					always take in the middle class; if he is making the laws of an oligarchical
					character he must keep the middle class in view, and if democratic, he must
					legislate so as to bring them in. <milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And where the number of the middle class exceeds both the extreme classes
					together, or even one of them only, here it is possible for a constitutional
					government to be lasting; <milestone n="1297a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for there is no fear of the rich ever coming to
					terms with the poor against this numerous middle class; for neither class will
					ever wish to be subject to the other, and if they look for another constitution
					fairer to both than this they will not find one, for they would not endure to
					take turns to govern because they distrust each other: everywhere it is the
					arbitrator that is most trusted, and the man in the middle is an arbitrator. And
					the better the constitution is mixed, the more permanent it is; <milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and many even of those who want to
					establish aristocratic forms of constitution make a great mistake not only in
					giving too large a share to the well-to-do but also in cheating the people; for
					false benefits inevitably result ultimately in true evil, as the encroachments
					of the rich ruin the constitution more than those of the people.<milestone n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The
					artifices employed in constitutions as a pretext in regard to the people are
					five in number, and are concerned with the assembly, the magistracies, the
					law-courts, the bearing of heavy arms, and gymnastic exercises; in relation to
					the assembly, the granting to all of the right to attend but the imposition of a
					fine for non-attendance on the well-to-do only, or a much larger fine on them
					than others; in relation to the magistracies,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the denial to the owners of rated property of the right to
					swear off serving, while the poor have this right; in relation to the
					law-courts, the imposition of a fine on the well-to-do if they do not serve on a
					jury, but no penalty for the poor, or else a large fine for the one class and a
					small one for the others, as in the laws of Charondas. <milestone n="10.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In some places all have the right to serve in the
					assembly and on juries after having their names put on a register, but large
					fines are imposed on those who after so registering fail to attend in either
					capacity, in order that the fine may cause them to avoid registration and that
					owing to their not registering they may not serve on juries or in the assembly.
					They also legislate in the same manner about owning heavy arms and engaging in
					gymnastic exercises: the poor are not allowed to possess arms, but the
					well-to-do are liable to a fine if they have not got them, and there is no fine
					for the former class if they abstain from gymnastics, but the well-to-do are
					liable to a fine, in order that the one class because of the fine may take part
					in them and the other because they have no penalty to fear may not. These
					artifices of legislation then are of an oligarchic nature; <milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>in democracies they introduce contrary devices in
					regard to these matters: they provide pay for the poor for serving in the
					assembly and on juries and impose no fine upon the well-to-do for abstaining.
					Hence it is manifest that if anybody wishes to make a just blend, he must bring
					together the regulations existing in each of the two forms of constitution, and
					provide pay for attendance and a fine for non-attendance; for thus all would
					participate, whereas in the other way the government comes to be in the hands of
					only one of the two classes. <milestone n="1297b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And although it is proper that the government
					should be drawn only from those who possess heavy armor, yet it is not possible
					to define the amount of the property-qualification absolutely and to say that
					they must possess so much, but only to consider what sort of amount is the
					highest that is compatible with making those who have a share in the
					constitution more numerous than those who have not, and to fix that limit.
						<milestone n="10.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For those who are poor and have
					no share in the honors are willing to keep quiet if no one insults them or takes
					away any part of their substance; but this is not easy to secure, for it does
					not always happen that those who are in the governing class are gentlemen. Also
					people have a way of being reluctant to serve when there is a war if they do not
					get rations and are poor men but; if somebody provides food they want to fight.
						<milestone n="10.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In some states the
					citizen-body consists not only of those who are serving as heavy-armed soldiers,
					but also of those who have so served; and at Malea the citizen-body consisted of
					these, while the magistrates were elected from those who were actually on
					service. And indeed the earliest form of constitution among the Greeks after the
					kingships consisted of those who were actually soldiers, the original form
					consisting of the cavalry &lpar;for war had its strength and its
					pre-eminence in cavalry, since without orderly formation heavy-armed
						infantry<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is useless, and the
					sciences and systems dealing with tactics did not exist among the men of old
					times, so that their strength lay in their cavalry&rpar;; but as the states
					grew and the wearers of heavy armor had become stronger, more persons came to
					have a part in the government. Hence what we now call constitutional governments
					the men of former times called democracies; <milestone n="10.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but the constitutional governments of early days were
					naturally oligarchical and royal, for owing to the smallness of the populations
					their middle class was not numerous, so that because of their small numbers as
					well as in conformity with the structure of the state the middle class more
					readily endured being in a subject position.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It
					has then been said what is the reason of there being several forms of
					constitution, and why there are others besides those designated by name
					&lpar;for there is not one single democracy only, and similarly there are
					more than one of the other forms&rpar;, and also what are the differences
					between them and what is the reason why these differences occur, and in addition
					to these points, which is the best of the constitutions speaking generally, and
					of the other constitutions which sort is suited to which sort of
						people.<milestone n="11.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And again, let us speak about the points that come next, both
					generally and with reference to each constitution separately, taking their
					appropriate starting-point. All forms of constitution then have three factors in
					reference to which the good lawgiver has to consider what is expedient for each
					constitution; and if these factors are well-ordered the constitution must of
					necessity be well-ordered, and the superiority of one constitution over another
					necessarily consists in the superiority of each of these factors. Of these three
					factors one is, what is to be the body that deliberates about the common
					interests, <milestone n="1298a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>second the one connected with the magistracies, that is, what
					there are to be and what matters they are to control, and what is to be the
					method of their election, and a third is, what is to be the judiciary.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The deliberative factor is sovereign about war and peace
					and the formation and dissolution of alliances, and about laws, and about
					sentences of death and exile and confiscation of property, and about the audits
					of magistrates. <milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And necessarily
					either all these decisions must be assigned to all the citizens, or all to some
					of them &lpar;for instance to some one magistracy or to several&rpar;,
					or different ones to different magistracies, or some of them to all the citizens
					and some to certain persons.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For all the citizens
					to be members of the deliberative body and to decide all these matters is a mark
					of a popular government, for the common people seek for equality of this nature.
						<milestone n="11.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there are several modes of
					such universal membership. One is for the citizens to serve in rotation and not
					all in a body &lpar;as is enacted in the constitution of the Milesian
						Telecles,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Otherwise unknown</note> and in
					other constitutions also the boards of magistrates deliberate in joint
					assemblies but all the citizens enter into the magistracies from the tribes or
					from the very smallest sections of the citizen-body in rotation until office has
					gone through the whole body&rpar;, and for there to be joint assemblies only
					to consider legislation and reforms of the constitution and to hear the reports
					submitted by the magistrates. <milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Another mode is<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for all to assemble
					in a body, but only for the purpose of electing magistrates, enacting laws,
					considering the declaration of war and the conclusion of peace and holding the
					audit of magistrates, but for all other matters to be considered by the
					magistrates appointed to deal with each respectively and elected by suffrage or
					by lot from all the citizens. Another mode is for the citizens to meet about the
					magistracies and the audits and in order to deliberate about declaring war and
					concluding an alliance, but for all other matters to be dealt with by the
					magistrates, elected by suffrage in as many cases as circumstances allow,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in an advanced democracy.</note> and such
					magistracies are all those which must of necessity be filled by experts.
						<milestone n="11.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A fourth mode is for all to
					meet in council about all matters, and for the magistracies to decide about
					nothing but only to make preliminary decisions; this is the mode in which
					democracy in its last form is administered at the present day&mdash;the form
					of democracy which we pronounce to correspond to dynastic oligarchy and to
					tyrannical monarchy. <milestone n="11.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These modes
					then are all of them democratic. On the other hand for some persons to
					deliberate upon all matters is oligarchic. But this also has several variations.
					For when the members of the deliberative body are elected on comparatively
					moderate property-qualifications, and the eligible persons are comparatively
					numerous because of the moderateness of the qualification, and when they do not
					make changes in things in which the law forbids it but follow the law, and when
					anybody acquiring the property-qualification is allowed to become a member, a
					constitution of this sort is indeed an oligarchy, but one of the nature of
					constitutional government, because of its moderation. When on the other hand not
					everybody thus qualified participates in deliberation but only certain persons
					previously chosen by election, <milestone n="1298b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and these govern in accordance with law as in
					the former case, this is oligarchical; and also when the deliberative officials
					are elected by co-optation, and when the office is hereditary and has supreme
					control over the laws, this system is bound to be oligarchical. <milestone n="11.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But when certain persons control certain
					matters, for instance when all the citizens control decisions as to war and
					peace and the audit of officials while everything else is controlled by
					magistrates and these are elected by vote, not by lot,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MSS. give &lsquo;or by lot.&rsquo;</note> the
					constitution is an aristocracy; while if some matters are controlled by
					magistrates elected by vote and others by magistrates chosen by lot, and this
					either directly or from a list previously selected by vote, or if magistrates
					elected by vote and by lot sit in a joint body, some of these regulations are
					features of an aristocratic constitution and others of constitutional government
						itself.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have then in this way distinguished
					the different kinds of deliberative body in relation to the forms of
					constitution, and each form of constitution carries on the administration in
					accordance with the distinction stated. <milestone n="11.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But for a democracy of the form that at the present day is
					considered to be democracy in the fullest degree &lpar;and I mean one of the
					sort in which the people is sovereign even over the laws&rpar; it is
					advantageous for the improvement of its deliberative function for it to do the
					same as is done in oligarchies in the matter of the law-courts &lpar;for
					they enact a fine to compel the attendance on juries of those whom they want to
					attend, whereas democratic states institute payment for attendance for the
					benefit of the poor&rpar;, and also to do this in respect of the
						assemblies<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&lpar;for they will
					deliberate better when all are deliberating jointly, the common people when with
					the notables and these when with the masses&rpar;, and it is also
					advantageous for those who deliberate to be elected by vote or by lot equally
					from the different sections, and, if the men of the people far exceed the
					political class in number, it is advantageous either not to give pay to all but
					only to as many as are commensurate with the number of the notables, or to
					discard by lot those who exceed this number. <milestone n="11.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In oligarchies on the other hand it is advantageous either
					to co-opt some persons from the multitude, or to institute an office like the
					one that exists in certain constitutional governments under the flame of
					Preliminary Councillors or Guardians of the Law,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">There were <foreign lang="greek">pro/bouloi</foreign> at
							<placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> as well as a
							<foreign lang="greek">boulh/</foreign> and an <foreign lang="greek">e)kklhsi/a</foreign>; and <foreign lang="greek">nomofu/lakes</foreign>
						at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and elsewhere: at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> they sat with the presidents of

					the matters about which these officials have held a preliminary deliberation
					&lpar;for thus the common people will have a share in deliberation and will
					not have the power to abolish any part of the constitution&rpar;, and then
					for the people by their vote either to confirm or at all events not to pass
					anything contrary to the resolutions brought before them, or to allow all to
					take part in debate but only the magistrates to frame resolutions; <milestone n="11.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and in fact it is proper to do just the
					opposite of what takes place in constitutionally governed states; for the common
					people ought to be given power to vote the rejection of a measure, but not to
					vote its ratification, but it should be referred back to the magistrates. In
					constitutional governments the procedure is the reverse; the few are competent
					to vote the rejection of a resolution but are not competent to vote its
					ratification, this being always referred back to the most numerous body.
						<milestone n="1299a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let us then decide in this
					manner about the deliberative body, which in fact is the sovereign power in the
						constitution.<milestone n="12.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Connected with this subject is the determination in regard to
					the magistracies &lpar;for this part of the constitution also has many
					varieties&rpar;, how many magistracies there are to be, and what are to be
					their powers, and what their various periods of tenure &lpar;for some people
					make their magistracies tenable for six months, others for less, others for a
					year and others for a longer period&rpar;&mdash;shall the magistracies
					be for life or for a long period, or if for a shorter term shall the same people
					be allowed to hold them several times or not the same man twice but once only?
						<milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and also as to the appointment
					of magistrates, who shall be eligible, who the electors, and what the mode of
					election? For on all these points it is needful to be able to determine how many
					modes of procedure are possible, and then to settle what modes are expedient for
					what sorts of constitution. Nor is it easy to decide to what kinds of office the
					name of magistracy ought to be applied; for the political community requires a
					great many officials, owing to which it is not proper to reckon all of them
					magistrates, whether elected by vote or by lot,&mdash;for instance first the
					priests &lpar;for this office must be considered as something different from
					the political magistracies&rpar;, and again there are leaders of choruses,
					and heralds, and persons are also elected as ambassadors.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of
					the offices exercising superintendence some are political, and are exercised
					either over the whole of the citizens in regard to some operation&mdash;for
					instance a general superintends them when serving as soldiers, or over a
					section&mdash;for instance the superintendent of women or of children; while
					others are economic &lpar;for states often elect officers to dole out
						corn<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Distributions of corn were made at
						times of scarcity, or when the state had received a present of
					corn.</note>&rpar;; and others are subordinate, and are the sort of services
					to which people when well off appoint slaves. But the title of magistracy, to
					put it simply, is chiefly to be applied to all those offices to which have been
					assigned the duties of deliberating about certain matters and of acting as
					judges and of issuing orders, and especially the last, for to give orders is
					most characteristic of authority. But this question is of virtually no practical
					importance &lpar;for no decision has yet been given, our discussion being
					merely about the name&rpar;, although it does admit of some further inquiry
					of a speculative kind. <milestone n="12.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other
					hand the questions what kinds and what number of magistracies are necessary to
					constitute a state at all, and what kinds although not necessary are
					advantageous for a good constitution, are questions that might preferably be
					discussed, both indeed as regards every form of constitution and particularly in
					regard to the small states. For it is true that in the large states it is
					possible and proper for one magistracy to be assigned to one function
					&lpar;for the large number of the citizens makes it possible for many people
					to enter on an official career, so as to intermit their tenure of some offices
					for a long time and to hold others only once, and also every task is better
					attended to if the attention is directed to one thing only than if it is busy
					with many&rpar;; <milestone n="1299b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="12.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in
					the small states it is inevitable that many offices must be gathered into few
					hands &lpar;for owing to shortage of manpower it is not easy for many people
					to be in office, since who will take over the posts as their
					successors?&rpar;. But sometimes small states require the same magistracies
					and laws as large ones except that the latter require the same persons to serve
					often, but in the former this only occurs after a long interval. Hence it is
					possible to assign several duties to one man at the same time &lpar;since
					they will not interfere with one another&rpar;, and to meet the shortage of
					man-power it is necessary to make the magistracies like spit-lampholders.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">An implement &lpar;its exact shape does
						not appear to be known&rpar; used by soldiers on campaign, here
						mentioned as an illustration of one tool serving two purposes, cf. 1252b
						1.</note>
					<milestone n="12.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If therefore we are able to say how
					many magistracies every state must necessarily possess and how many, though not
					absolutely necessary, it ought to possess, knowing these points one might more
					easily make a combination of those magistracies which are of a suitable nature
					to be combined into a single office. And it is suitable for the further question
					not to be overlooked, what kinds of matters ought to be attended to by a number
					of officials locally distributed and what ought to be under the authority of one
					magistrate for all localities, for example should good order be seen to in the
					market-place by a Controller of the Market and elsewhere by another official, or
					everywhere by the same one? and ought the offices to be divided according to the
					function or according to the persons concerned&mdash;I mean, for instance,
					should there be a single official in control of good order, or a different
						one<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for children and for women?
						<milestone n="12.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and also under the various
					constitutions does the nature of the magistracies vary in accordance with each
					or does it not vary at all&mdash;for example in democracy, oligarchy,
					aristocracy and monarchy are the magistracies the same in their powers, although
					they are not filled from equal ranks nor from similar classes but are different
					in different constitutions &lpar;for example in aristocracies drawn from the
					educated, in oligarchies from the wealthy, and in democracies from the
					free&rpar;, or although some constitutions happen to be correspondent with
					the actual differences of their magistracies, yet in other cases are the same
					magistracies advantageous even where the constitutions differ &lpar;for in
					some places it is suitable for the same magistracies to have large functions and
					in other places small ones&rpar;? <milestone n="12.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Not but what there are also some offices peculiar to
					special forms of constitution, for instance the office of Preliminary
						Councillors.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1298b 29 n.</note> This
					is undemocratic, although a Council is a popular body, for there is bound to be
					some body of this nature to have the duty of preparing measures for the popular
					assembly, in order that it may be able to attend to its business; but a
					preparatory committee, if small, is oligarchical, and Preliminary Councillors
					must necessarily be few in number, so that they are an oligarchical element. But
					where both of these magistracies exist, the Preliminary Councillors are in
					authority over the Councillors, since a councillor is a democratic official, but
					a preliminary councillor is an oligarchic one. <milestone n="12.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the power of the Council is weakened in democracies
					of the sort in which the people in assembly deals with everything itself;
						<milestone n="1300a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this usually happens when there is a plentiful supply of
					pay for those who attend the assembly, for being at leisure they meet frequently
					and decide all things themselves. But a Superintendent of Children and a
					Superintendent of Women, and any other magistrates that exercise a similar sort
					of supervision, are an aristocratic feature, and not democratic &lpar;for
					how is it possible to prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly &lsquo;from going in
						processions&rsquo;: Solon made regulations <foreign lang="greek">tai=s
							e)co/dois tw=n gunaikw=n kai\ toi=s pe/nqesi kai\ tai=s
							e(ortai=s</foreign>&lpar;<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 21">Plut. Sol.
							21</bibl>&rpar;.</note>?&rpar; nor yet oligarchic &lpar;for
					the wives of oligarchic rulers are luxurious&rpar;. <milestone n="12.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But let the discussion of these matters go no
					further at present, and let us attempt to go through from the beginning the
					question of the ways of appointing the magistrates. The varieties here depend on
					three determinants, the combinations of which must give all the possible modes.
					One of these three determining points is, who are the persons who appoint the
					magistrates? the second is, from whom? and last, in what manner? And of each of
					these three determinants there are three variations: either all the citizens
					appoint or some, and either from all or from a certain class &lpar;defined
					for instance by property-assessment or birth or virtue or some other such
					qualification, as at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> only
					those were eligible who returned in a body from exile and fought together
					against the common people&rpar;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is
						quite uncertain when this event took place and whether it is the same as
						those referred to at 1302b 30 f. and l304b 34 ff.</note> and the mode of
					appointment may be either by vote or by lot; <milestone n="12.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>again, these systems may be coupled
						together&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>I mean that
					some citizens may appoint to some offices but all to others, and to some offices
					all citizens may be eligible but to others only a certain class, and to some
					appointment may be by vote but to others by lot. And of each variation of these
					determinants there will be four modes: either all citizens may appoint from all
					by vote, or all from all by lot&mdash;and from all either section by
					section, for instance by tribes or demes or brotherhoods until the procedure has
					gone through all the citizens, or from the whole number every time,&mdash;or
					else partly in one way and partly in the other. Again, if the electors are some
					of the citizens, they must either appoint from all by vote, or from all by lot,
					or from some by vote, or from some by lot, or partly in one way and partly in
					the other&mdash;I mean partly by vote and partly by lot. Hence the modes
					prove to be twelve, apart from the two combinations. <milestone n="12.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And among these, two ways of appointment are
					democratic&mdash;for all to appoint from all by vote, or by lot, or by
					both&mdash;some offices by lot and others by vote; but for not all to be the
					electors and for them to appoint simultaneously, and either from all or from
					some either by lot or by vote or by both, or some offices from all and others
					from some by both &lpar;by which I mean some by lot and others by
					vote&rpar; is constitutional. And for some to appoint from all, to some
					offices by vote and to others by lot or by both<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be rewritten to give &lsquo;for
						some to appoint from all either by vote or by lot or by
						both.&rsquo;</note> &lpar;to some by lot and to others by
					vote&rpar; is oligarchical; and it is even more oligarchical to appoint from
					both classes. <milestone n="12.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But to appoint some
					offices from all and the others from a certain class is constitutional with an
					aristocratic bias; <milestone n="1300b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or to appoint some by vote and others by lot. And
					for a certain class to appoint from a certain class &lt;by vote&gt;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This insertion by Lambinus seems
						certain.</note> is oligarchical, and so it is for a certain class to appoint
					from a certain class by lot &lpar;although not working out in the same
					way&rpar;, and for a certain class to appoint from a certain class by both
					methods. And for a certain class to make a preliminary selection from the whole
					body and then for all to appoint from among certain persons &lpar;thus
					selected&rpar; is aristocratic.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So many in
					number therefore are the modes of appointing to the magistracies, and this is
					how the modes are classified according to the different constitutions; and what
					regulations are advantageous for what people and how the appointments ought to
					be conducted will be made clear at the same time as we consider what are the
					powers of the offices. By the power of an office I mean for instance the control
					of the revenues and the control of the guard; since a different sort of power
					belongs for example to a generalship and to the office that controls market
						contracts.<milestone n="13.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Of the three factors of a constitution it remains to speak of
					the judiciary, and of judicial bodies also we must consider the various modes,
					in accordance with the same plan. And a difference among judicial courts rests
					upon three determinants&mdash;constituents, sphere of action, and mode of
					appointment. As to their constituents I mean are the courts drawn from all the
					citizens or from a certain class? as to sphere of action, how many kinds of
					courts are there? and as to mode of appointment, are they appointed by lot or by
					vote? First then let us distinguish how many kinds of courts there are. They are
					eight in number, one a court of audit,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>another to deal with offenders against any public interest, another with
					matters that bear on the constitution, a fourth for both magistrates and private
					persons in disputes about penalties, fifth the court dealing with private
					contracts that are on an important scale, and beside these there is
					&lpar;6&rpar; the court that tries homicide, and &lpar;7&rpar;
					that which hears alien suits <milestone n="13.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;of courts of homicide there are four kinds, whether the jury is the
					same or different&mdash;namely, for cases of deliberate homicide, of
					involuntary homicide, of homicide admitted but claimed to be justifiable, and
					fourth to deal with charges of homicide brought against men that have fled from
					the country for homicide, upon their return,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. men that had been allowed to flee the country when charged with
						accidental homicide, and on their return were accused of another homicide, a
						willful murder.</note> such as at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for instance the Court at Phreatto is said to be,
					although such cases are of rare occurrence in the whole course of history, even
					in the great states and of the aliens' court one branch hears suits of aliens
					against aliens and another of aliens against citizens&rpar;; and also beside
					all of these there are &lpar;8&rpar; courts to try cases of petty
					contracts, involving sums of one drachma, five drachmas or a little
					more&mdash;for even these cases have to be tried, though they are not
					suitable for a numerous jury. <milestone n="13.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					let us dismiss the subject of these petty suits, and the courts for homicide and
					those for aliens, and let us speak about political trials, which when not well
					conducted cause party divisions and revolutionary disturbances. And necessarily
					either all the judges of all the cases that have been classified will be
					appointed by vote, or by lot, or all in all cases partly by lot and partly by
					vote, or in some cases some judges will be appointed by lot and others by vote
					for the same case. <milestone n="1301a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>These modes then are four in number, and the
					sectional modes also make as many others; for here again the judges for all
					cases may be drawn by vote from a certain class, or for all cases by lot from a
					certain class, or some courts may be appointed by lot and others by vote, or
					some courts may be composed of judges chosen by lot and by vote for the same
					cases. These then are the modes, as was said, corresponding to those mentioned.
						<milestone n="13.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there are also the same
					courts in combination&mdash;I mean for example some drawn from the whole
					body and some from a class and some from both, as for instance if the same court
					contained some members from the whole body and others from a class, and
					appointed either by lot or by vote or both. We have then stated all the modes in
					which it is possible for the courts to be composed; and of these the first set,
					drawn from all the citizens and dealing with all cases, are popular, the second,
					drawn from a certain class to deal with all cases, are oligarchic, and the
					third, drawn partly from all and partly from a certain class, are suited to an
					aristocracy and to a constitutional government.</p>

						editors, as Book 8 by others, see Book 3 fin., note.</note>Almost all the
					other subjects which we intended to treat<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>have now been discussed. There must follow the consideration of
					the questions, what are the number and the nature of the causes that give rise
					to revolutions in constitutions, and what are the causes that destroy each form
					of constitution, and out of what forms into what forms do they usually change,
					and again what are the safeguards of constitutions in general and of each form
					in particular, and what are the means by which the safeguarding of each may best
					be put into effect.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">For this distinction
						between broad methods of guarding against revolution and the practical means
						by which those methods can be put into effect Newman compares 9.2 f., 10 f.;
						4.2.5 fin., 6.1.1.</note>
					<milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And
					we must first assume the starting-point, that many forms of constitution have
					come into existence with everybody agreeing as to what is just, that is
					proportionate equality, but failing to attain it &lpar;as has also been said
					before&rpar;. Thus democracy arose from men's thinking that if they are
					equal in any respect they are equal absolutely &lpar;for they suppose that
					because they are all alike free they are equal absolutely&rpar;, oligarchy
					arose from their assuming that if they are unequal as regards some one thing
					they are unequal wholly &lpar;for being unequal in property they assume that
					they are unequal absolutely&rpar;; <milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and then the democrats claim as being equal to participate
					in all things in equal shares, while the oligarchs as being unequal seek to have
					a larger share, for a larger share is unequal. All these forms of constitution
					then have some element of justice, but from an absolute point of view they are
					erroneous; and owing to this cause, when each of the two parties has not got the
					share in the constitution which accords with the fundamental assumption that
					they happen to entertain, faction ensues. And of all men those who excel in
					virtue would most justifiably stir up faction, though they are least given to
					doing so; <milestone n="1301b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they alone can with the fullest reason be deemed absolutely
					unequal. And there are some men who being superior in birth claim unequal rights
					because of this inequality; for persons who have ancestral virtue and wealth
					behind them are thought to be noble.<milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These then roughly speaking are the
					starting-points and sources of factions, which give rise to party strife
					&lpar;and revolutions due to this take place in two ways: sometimes they are
					in regard to the constitution, and aim at changing from the one established to
					another, for instance from democracy to oligarchy, or to democracy from
					oligarchy, or from these to constitutional government and aristocracy, or from
					those to these; but sometimes the revolution is not in regard to the established
					constitution, but its promoters desire the same form of government, for instance
					oligarchy or monarchy, but wish it to be in their own control. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again it may be a question of degree; for
					instance, when there is an oligarchy the object may be to change to a more
					oligarchical government or to a less, or when there is a democracy to a more or
					to a less democratic government, and similarly in the case of the remaining
					constitutions, the aim may be either to tighten them up or to relax them. Or
					again the aim may be to change a certain part of the constitution, for example
					to establish or abolish a certain magistracy, as according to some accounts
						Lysander<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>attempted to abolish the
					kingship at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and the king
					Pausanias the ephorate<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1307a 34
					n.</note>; <milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and also at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> the constitution was altered in
					part, for they set up a council instead of the tribal rulers, and it is still
					compulsory for the magistrates alone of the class that has political power to
					come to the popular assembly when an appointment to a magistracy is put to the
					vote; and the single supreme magistrate was also an oligarchical feature in this
					constitution&rpar;. For party strife is everywhere due to inequality, where
					classes that are unequal do not receive a share of power in proportion
					&lpar;for a lifelong monarchy is an unequal feature when it exists among
					equals&rpar;; for generally the motive for factious strife is the desire for
					equality. <milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But equality is of two
					kinds, numerical equality and equality according to worth&mdash;by
					numerically equal I mean that which is the same and equal in number or
					dimension, by equal according to worth that which is equal by proportion<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This ethical arithmetic is helped out in Greek
						by the fact that, even without the qualification <foreign lang="greek">kat'
							a)ci/an, i)/sos</foreign> often means &lsquo;equal to
						desert,&rsquo; fair, just.</note>; for instance numerically 3 exceeds 2
					and 2 exceeds 1 by an equal amount, but by proportion 4 exceeds 2 and 2 exceeds
					1 equally, since 2 and 1 are equal parts of 4 and 2, both being halves. But
					although men agree that the absolutely just is what is according to worth, they
					disagree &lpar;as was said before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						1301a 27 ff. and note.</note>&rpar; in that some think that if they are
					equal in something they are wholly equal, and others claim that if they are
					unequal in something they deserve an unequal share of all things. <milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Owing to this two principal varieties of
					constitution come into existence, democracy and oligarchy; for noble birth and
					virtue are found in few men, but the qualifications specified<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">That is, numbers and wealth.</note> in more:
						<milestone n="1302a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>nowhere are there a hundred men nobly born and good, but there
					are rich men<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text should be
						emended to give &lsquo;there are many rich men and poor men in many
						places.&rsquo;</note> in many places. But for the constitution to be
					framed absolutely and entirely according to either kind of equality is bad. And
					this is proved by experience, for not one of the constitutions formed on such
					lines is permanent. And the cause of this is that it is impossible for some evil
					not to occur ultimately from the first and initial error that has been made.
					Hence the proper course is to employ numerical equality in some things and
					equality according to worth in others. <milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But nevertheless democracy is safer and more free from
					civil strife than oligarchy; for in oligarchies two kinds of strife spring up,
					faction between different members of the oligarchy and also faction between the
					oligarchs and the people, whereas in democracies only strife between the people
					and the oligarchical party occurs, but party strife between different sections
					of the people itself does not occur to any degree worth mentioning. And again
					the government formed of the middle classes is nearer to the people than to the
					few, and it is the safest of the kinds of constitution mentioned.<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since we
					are considering what circumstances give rise to party factions and revolutions
					in constitutions, we must first ascertain their origins and causes generally.
					They are, speaking roughly, three in number,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Viz. the material, final and efficient causes of revolutions
						&lpar;Jowett&rpar;.</note> which we must first define in outline
						separately.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For we must ascertain
					what state of affairs gives rise to party strife, and for what objects it is
					waged, and thirdly what are the origins of political disorders and internal
					party struggles.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now the principal cause, speaking
					generally, of the citizens being themselves disposed in a certain manner towards
					revolution is the one about which we happen to have spoken already. Those that
					desire equality enter on party strife if they think that they have too little
					although they are the equals of those who have more, while those that desire
					inequality or superiority do so if they suppose that although they are unequal
					they have not got more but an equal amount or less <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;and these desires may be felt justly, and they
					may also be felt unjustly&rpar;; for when inferior, people enter on strife
					in order that they may be equal, and when equal, in order that they may be
					greater. We have therefore said what are the states of feeling in which men
					engage in party strife.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The objects about which it
					is waged are gain and honor, and their opposites, for men carry on party faction
					in states in order to avoid dishonor and loss, either on their own behalf or on
					behalf of their friends.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And the causes and origins of the disturbances which
					occasion the actual states of feeling described and their direction to the
					objects mentioned, according to one account happen to be seven in number, though
					according to another they are more. Two of them are the same as those spoken of
					before although not operating in the same way: the motives of gain and honor
					also stir men up against each other not in order that they may get them for
					themselves, as has been said before, <milestone n="1302b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but because they see other men
					in some cases justly and in other cases unjustly getting a larger share of them.
					Other causes are insolence, fear, excessive predominance, contempt,
					disproportionate growth of power; and also other modes of cause<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The four causes now mentioned are those
						alluded to just above &lpar;1302a 38&rpar; as an addition to the
						seven enumerated above, 1302a 38-b 5.</note> are election intrigue,
					carelessness, pettiness, dissimilarity. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Among these motives the power possessed by insolence and
					gain, and their mode of operation, is almost obvious; for when the men in office
					show insolence and greed, people rise in revolt against one another and against
					the constitutions that afford the opportunity for such conduct; and greed
					sometimes preys on private property and sometimes on common funds. It is clear
					also what is the power of honor and how it can cause party faction; for men form
					factions both when they are themselves dishonored and when they see others
					honored; and the distribution of honors is unjust when persons are either
					honored or dishonored against their deserts, just when it is according to
					desert. Excessive predominance causes faction, when some individual or body of
					men is greater and more powerful than is suitable to the state and the power of
					the government; for such are the conditions that usually result in the rise of a
					monarchy or dynasty. <milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Owing to this
					in some places they have the custom of temporary banishment,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1284a 18.</note> as at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;
					yet it would be better to provide from the outset that there may be no persons
					in the state<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so greatly predominant,
					than first to allow them to come into existence and afterwards to apply a
					remedy. Fear is the motive of faction with those who have inflicted wrong and
					are afraid of being punished, and also with those who are in danger of suffering
					a wrong and wish to act in time before the wrong is inflicted, as the notables
					at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> banded together<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps in <date value="-390">390</date> B.C.,
						cf. 1302b 32 f. and 1304b 27 ff.</note> against the people because of the
					law-suits that were being brought against them. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Contempt is a cause of faction and of actual attacks, upon
					the government, for instance in oligarchies when those who have no share in the
					government are more numerous &lpar;for they think themselves the stronger
					party&rpar;, and in democracies when the rich have begun to feel contempt
					for the disorder and anarchy that prevails, as for example at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> the democracy was destroyed owing to
					bad government after the battle of Oenophyta,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, <date value="-456">456</date> B.C.</note> and that of the Megarians was
					destroyed when they had been defeated owing to disorder and anarchy,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1300a 18 n.</note> and at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> before the tyranny<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><date value="-485">485</date> B.C.</note> of
					Gelo, and at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1302b 23 n.</note> the common people had fallen into
					contempt before the rising against them. <milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Revolutions in the constitutions also take place on
					account of disproportionate growth; for just as the body<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is not clear whether what follows refers to a work of art
						&lpar;cf. 1284b 8&rpar; or is an exaggerated account of a disease;
						Galen describes one called <foreign lang="greek">saturi/asis</foreign>, in
						which the bones of the temple swell out like satyrs' horns.</note> is
					composed of parts, and needs to grow proportionately in order that its symmetry
					may remain, and if it does not it is spoiled, when the foot is four cubits long
					and the rest of the body two spans, and sometimes it might even change into the
					shape of another animal if it increased disproportionately not only in size but
					also in quality,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. if, for example, the
						foot became as hard as a hoof.</note> so also a state is composed of parts,
						<milestone n="1303a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>one of which often grows without its being noticed, as for
					example the number of the poor in democracies and constitutional states.
						<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And sometimes this is also
					brought about by accidental occurrences, as for instance at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> when a great many notables were
					defeated and killed by the Iapygians a short time after the Persian wars a
					constitutional government was changed to a democracy, and at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> when those in the seventh tribe<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word to be understood here may be <foreign lang="greek">fulh=|</foreign>, or possibly <foreign lang="greek">h(me/ra|</foreign>: the seventh day of the month was sacred to Apollo,
						especially at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and one
						account assigns Cleomenes' victory to that day, in which case the casualties
						may well have been known afterwards as &lsquo;those who fell on the
						seventh.&rsquo;</note> had been destroyed by the Spartan Cleomenes the
					citizens were compelled to admit some of the surrounding people, and at
						<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> when they suffered
					disasters by land the notables became fewer because at the time of the war
					against <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> the army was drawn
					from a muster-roll.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. was made up of
						citizens and not of mercenaries.</note> And this happens also in
					democracies, though to a smaller extent; for when the wealthy become more
					numerous or their properties increase, the governments change to oligarchies and
						dynasties.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1292b 10 n.</note>
					<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And revolutions in constitutions
					take place even without factious strife, owing to election intrigue, as at
						<placeName key="perseus,Heraea">Heraea</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">On the Alpheus, in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.</note> &lpar;for they made their magistrates
					elected by lot instead of by vote for this reason, because the people used to
					elect those who canvassed&rpar;; and also owing to carelessness, when people
					allow men that are not friends of the constitution to enter into the sovereign
					offices, as at Oreus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>; its secession from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, <date value="-377">377</date>
						B.C., was perhaps the occasion of this revolution.</note> oligarchy was
					broken up when Heracleodorus became one of the magistrates, who in place of an
						oligarchy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>formed a constitutional
					government, or rather a democracy. Another cause is alteration by small stages;
					by this I mean that often a great change of institutions takes place unnoticed
					when people overlook a small alteration, as in <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName> the property-qualification was small, and finally men
					hold office with none at all, as a little is near to nothing, or practically the
					same. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also difference of race is a
					cause of faction, until harmony of spirit is reached; for just as any chance
					multitude of people does not form a state, so a state is not formed in any
					chance period of time. Hence most of the states that have hitherto admitted
					joint settlers or additional settlers<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.
						colonists not from the mother-city, admitted either at the foundation of the
						colony or later.</note> have split into factions; for example Achaeans

					<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&lpar;And in oligarchies civil strife is
					raised by the many, on the ground that they are treated unjustly because they

					equal share although they are not equal.&rpar;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence is out of place here, and would fit in better

					<milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Also
					states sometimes enter on faction for geographical reasons, when the nature of
					the country is not suited for there being a single city, as for example at

						people and followed by Gelo's tyranny, <date value="-485">485</date>
						B.C.</note> between two young men, who belonged to the ruling class, about a
					love affair. While one of them was abroad the other who was his comrade won over
					the youth with whom he was in love, and the former in his anger against him
					retaliated by persuading his wife to come to him; owing to which they stirred up
					a party struggle among all the people in the state, enlisting them on their
					sides. <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On account of this it is
					necessary to guard against such affairs at their beginning, and to break up the
					factions of the leaders and powerful men; for the error occurs at the beginning,
					and the beginning as the proverb says is half of the whole, so that even a small
					mistake at the beginning stands in the same ratio<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the ratio of being a half to the whole: a bad start does
						as much to harm as all the later mistakes put together.</note> to mistakes
					at the other stages. And in general the faction quarrels of the notables involve
					the whole state in the consequences, as happened at Hestiaea<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Also called Oreus, see 1303a 18.</note> after the Persian
					wars, when two brothers quarrelled about the division of their patrimony; for
					the poorer of the two, on the ground that the other would not make a return of
					the estate and of the treasure that their father had found, got the common
					people on his side, and the other possessing much property was supported by the
					rich. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> the beginning of all the factions
					that occurred afterwards was when a quarrel arose out of a marriage; <milestone n="1304a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the
					bridegroom interpreted some chance occurrence when he came to fetch the bride as
					a bad omen and went away without taking her, and her relatives thinking
					themselves insulted threw some articles of sacred property into the fire when he
					was performing a sacrifice and then put him to death as guilty of sacrilege. And
					also at <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The revolt of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>

					daughters, and a man who was rejected in his suit to obtain them for his own

					the beginning for the Phocians of the Holy War. At Epidamnus also circumstances
					relating to a marriage gave rise to a revolution in the constitution<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the same event as that referred to
						1301b 21.</note>; somebody had betrothed his daughter, and the father of the
					man to whom he had betrothed her became a magistrate, and had to sentence him to
					a fine; the other thinking that he had been treated with insolence formed a
					party of the unenfranchised classes to assist him. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also revolutions to oligarchy and democracy and
					constitutional government arise from the growth in reputation or in power of
					some magistracy or some section of the state;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as for example the Council on the Areopagus having risen in
					reputation during the Persian wars was believed to have made the constitution
					more rigid, and then again the naval multitude, having been the cause of the
					victory off <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and thereby of the
					leadership of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> due to her

					<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And indeed in general it must not
					escape notice that the persons who have caused a state to win power, whether
					private citizens or magistrates or tribes, or in general a section or group of
					any kind, stir up faction; for either those who envy these men for being honored
					begin the faction, or these men owing to their superiority are not willing to
					remain in a position of equality. And constitutions also undergo revolution when
					what are thought of as opposing sections of the state become equal to one
					another, <milestone n="1304b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for instance the rich and the people, and there is no middle
					class or only an extremely small one; for if either of the two sections becomes
					much the superior, the remainder is not willing to risk an encounter with its
					manifestly stronger opponent. Owing to this men who are exceptional in virtue
					generally speaking do not cause faction, because they find themselves few
					against many. Universally then in connection with all the forms of constitution
					the origins and causes of factions and revolutions are of this nature.<milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The means
					used to cause revolutions of constitutions are sometimes force and sometimes
					fraud. Force is employed either when the revolutionary leaders exert compulsion
					immediately from the start or later on&mdash;as indeed the mode of using
					fraud is also twofold: sometimes the revolutionaries after completely deceiving
					the people at the first stage alter the constitution with their consent, but
					then at a later stage retain their hold on it by force against the people's
					will: for instance, at the time of the Four Hundred,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The oligarchy at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
						<date value="-411">411</date> B.C., cf. 1305a 27.</note> they deceived the
					people by saying that the Persian King would supply money for the war against
					the Spartans, and after telling them this falsehood endeavored to keep a hold
					upon the government; but in other cases they both persuade the people at the
					start and afterwards repeat the persuasion and govern them with their
						consent.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Speaking generally therefore in
					regard to all the forms of constitution, the causes that have been stated are
					those from which revolutions have occurred.<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But in the light of these
					general rules we must consider the usual course of events<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as classified according to each different kind of
					constitution. In democracies the principal cause of revolutions is the insolence
					of the demagogues; for they cause the owners of property to band together,
					partly by malicious prosecutions of individuals among them &lpar;for common
					fear brings together even the greatest enemies&rpar;, and partly by setting
					on the common people against them as a class. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And one may see this taking place in this manner in many
					instances. In Cos the democracy was overthrown<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Date unknown.</note> when evil demagogues had arisen there,
					for the notables banded themselves together; and also in <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						1302b 23 n.</note> for the demagogues used to provide pay for public
					services, and also to hinder the payment of money owed<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. owed for repairs to the ships, and perhaps also for
						advances of pay to the crews.</note> to the naval captains, and these
					because of the lawsuits that were brought against them were forced to make
					common cause and overthrow the people. And also at <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably the Pontic
						Heraclea &lpar;cf. 1305b 5, 36, 1306a 37&rpar;, founded middle of
						the 6th century B.C., not the Trachinian.</note> the people were put down
					immediately after the foundation of the colony because of the people's leaders;
					for the notables being unjustly treated by them used to be driven out, but later
					on those who were driven out collecting together effected their return and put
					down the people. <milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also the
					democracy at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> was put down in
					a similar manner<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1300a 18 ff. n.</note>;
					the people's leaders in order to have money to distribute to the people went on
					expelling many of the notables, until they made the exiles a large body, and
					these came back and defeated the people in a battle and set up the oligarchy.
					And the same thing happened also at Cyme <milestone n="1305a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the time of the democracy
					which Thrasymachus put down<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">An event
						otherwise unknown.</note>, and in the case of other states also examination
					would show that revolutions take place very much in this manner. Sometimes they
					make the notables combine by wronging them in order to curry favor, causing
					either their estates to be divided up or their revenues by imposing public
					services, and sometimes by so slandering them that they may have the property of
					the wealthy to confiscate. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in
					old times whenever the same man became both leader of the people and general,
					they used to change the constitution to a tyranny; for almost the largest number
					of the tyrants of early days have risen from being leaders of the people. And
					the reason why this used to happen then but does not do so now is because then
					the leaders of the people were drawn from those who held the office of general
					&lpar;for they were not yet skilled in oratory&rpar;, but now when
					rhetoric has developed the able speakers are leaders of the people, but owing to
					their inexperience in military matters they are not put in control of these,
					except in so far as something of the kind has taken place to a small extent in
					some places. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And tyrannies also used
					to occur in former times more than they do now because important offices were
					entrusted to certain men, as at <placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName> a tyranny<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps
						that of Thrasybulus &lpar;<bibl n="Hdt. 1.20">Hdt.
						1.20</bibl>&rpar;, <date value="-612">612</date> B.C.</note> arose out
					of the presidency &lpar;for the president had control of many important
					matters&rpar;. And moreover, because the cities in those times were not
					large but the common people lived on their farms<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>busily engaged in agriculture, the people's champions when they
					became warlike used to aim at tyranny. And they all used to do this when they
					had acquired the confidence of the people, and their pledge of confidence was
					their enmity towards the rich, as at Athens Pisistratus made himself tyrant by
					raising up a party against the men of the plain, and Theagenes at <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> by slaughtering the cattle of the
					well-to-do which he captured grazing by the river, and Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Dionysius the elder, see 1259a 29 n.</note>
					established a claim to become tyrant when he accused Daphnaeus and the rich,
					since his hostility to them caused him to be trusted as a true man of the
					people. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And revolutions also take
					place from the ancestral form of democracy to one of the most modern kind; for
					where the magistracies are elective, but not on property-assessments, and the
					people elect, men ambitious of office by acting as popular leaders bring things
					to the point of the people's being sovereign even over the laws. A remedy to
					prevent this or to reduce its extent is for the tribes to elect the magistrates,
					and not the people collectively.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These then are
					the causes through which almost all the revolutions in democracies take
						place.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Oligarchies undergo revolution principally through two ways
					that are the most obvious. One is if they treat the multitude unjustly; for
					anybody makes an adequate people's champion, and especially so when their leader
					happens to come from the oligarchy itself, like Lygdamis at <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName>, who afterwards actually became tyrant
					of the Naxians. <milestone n="1305b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Faction
					originating with other people also has various ways of arising. Sometimes when
					the honors of office are shared by very few, dissolution originates from the
					wealthy themselves,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The contrasted case, of
						dissolution of oligarchy arising from the people, should follow, but is
						omitted.</note> but not those that are in office, as for example has
					occurred at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1321a 29 ff.</note> at <placeName key="tgn,6002796">Istrus</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Near the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>.</note> at <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1304b 31
						n.</note> and in other states; for those who did not share in the
					magistracies raised disturbances until as a first stage the older brothers were
					admitted, and later the younger ones again &lpar;for in some places a father
					and a son may not hold office together, and in others an elder and a younger
					brother may not&rpar;. At <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> the oligarchy became more constitutional, while at
						<placeName key="tgn,6002796">Istrus</placeName> it ended in becoming
					democracy, and in <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> the
					government passed from a smaller number to six hundred. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>At <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName>
					also there was a revolution<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps not the
						same as the one mentioned at 1306b 3.</note> of the oligarchy caused by a
					faction formed by the notables against one another, because few shared in the
					government, and the rule stated held, that if a father was a member a son could
					not be, nor if there were several brothers could any except the eldest; for the
					common people seized the opportunity of their quarrel and, taking a champion
					from among the notables, fell upon them and conquered them, for a party divided
					against itself is weak. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Another case
					was at Erythrae,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Just west of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>. The family name implies a claim
						to royal ancestry.</note> where at the time of the oligarchy of the
					Basilidae in ancient days, although<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the persons in the government directed affairs well, nevertheless the common
					people were resentful because they were governed by a few, and brought about a
					revolution of the constitution.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On the other hand,
					oligarchies are overthrown from within themselves both<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence is interrupted by a parenthesis and is resumed
						in 5.6, &lsquo;And revolution is oligarchy
						also&mdash;&rsquo;.</note> when from motives of rivalry they play
					the demagogue &lpar;and this demagogy is of two sorts, one among the
					oligarchs themselves, for a demagogue can arise among them even when they are a
					very small body,&mdash;as for instance in the time of the Thirty at
						<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the party of Charicles
					rose to power by currying popularity with the Thirty, and in the time of the
					Four Hundred<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1304b 12 n.</note> the party
					of Phrynichus rose in the same way,&mdash;<milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>the other when the members of the oligarchy curry
					popularity with the mob, as the Civic Guards at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1275b 29
						n.</note> courted popularity with the mob because it elected them, and in
					all the oligarchies in which the magistracies are not elected by the class from
					which the magistrates come but are filled from high property-grades or from
					political clubs while the electors are the heavy-armed soldiers or the common
					people, as used to be the case at <placeName key="tgn,6000030">Abydos</placeName>, and in places where the jury-courts are not made up
					from the government<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.
						&lpar;apparently&rpar; where membership is not confined to the class
						eligible for the magistracies.</note>&mdash;for there members of the
					oligarchy by courting popular favor with a view to their trials cause a
					revolution of the constitution, as took place at <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> on the Euxine<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						1304b 31 n.</note>; <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and a
					further instance is when some men try to narrow down the oligarchy to a smaller
					number, for those who seek equality are forced to bring in the people as a
					helper.&rpar; And revolutions in oligarchy also take place when they
					squander their private means by riotous living; for also men of this sort seek
					to bring about a new state of affairs, and either aim at tyranny themselves or
					suborn somebody else <milestone n="1306a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&lpar;as Hipparinus put forward Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1259a 29 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and at <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1303b 2 n.</note> a man named Cleotimus led the
					additional settlers that came from <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> and on their arrival stirred them up to sedition
					against the wealthy, and in <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> the
					man who carried out the transactions with Chares attempted to cause a revolution
					in the constitution for a reason of this sort<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. he had squandered his fortune in riotous living; this deal with the
						Athenian general may have been in <date value="-367">367</date>
					B.C.</note>&rpar;; <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>so sometimes
					they attempt at once to introduce some reform, at other times they rob the
					public funds and in consequence either they or those who fight against them in
					their peculations stir up faction against the government, as happened at
						<placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> on the Black Sea.
					On the other hand, harmonious oligarchy does not easily cause its own
					destruction; and an indication of this is the constitutional government at
						<placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName>, for there the ruling
					class though few are masters of many men<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e.
						both of the lower classes and of the subject cities.</note> because on good
					terms with one another. <milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also
					oligarchical governments break up when they create a second oligarchy within the
					oligarchy. This is when, although the whole citizen class is small, its few
					members are not all admitted to the greatest offices; this is what once occurred
					in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, for the government being in
					the hands of a few, very few men used to become members of the Elders,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the small governing body.</note> because

					dynastic type<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. like a

						<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.<milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Revolutions<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of oligarchies occur both during war and in
					time of peace&mdash; during war since the oligarchs are forced by their
					distrust of the people to employ mercenary troops &lpar;for the man in whose
					hands they place them often becomes tyrant, as Timophanes did at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> was at
						war with <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> circa <date value="-350">350</date> B.C. Timophanes was killed by his brother the
						famous Timoleon, in order to restore constitutional government.</note> and
					if they put several men in command, these win for themselves dynastic
					power&rpar;, and when through fear of this they give a share in the
					constitution to the multitude, the oligarchy falls because they are compelled to
					make use of the common people; during peace, on the other hand, because of their
					distrust of one another they place their protection in the hands of mercenary
					troops and a magistrate between the two parties, who sometimes becomes master of
					both, which happened at <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> in the
					time of the government of the Aleuadae led by Simus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A probable emendation of the Greek gives &lsquo;happened

					clubs of which that of Iphiades was one. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And factions arise also in consequence of one set of the
					members of the oligarchy themselves being pushed aside by another set and being
					driven into party strife in regard to marriages or law-suits; examples of such
					disorders arising out of a cause related to marriage are the instances spoken of
					before, and also the oligarchy of the knights at <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName> was put down<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Possibly before the Persian wars. See 1289b 36 ff. The two
						following cases are unrecorded elsewhere.</note> by Diagoras when he had

					did so against Archias; for their personal enemies stirred up party feeling
					against them so as to get them bound in the pillory in the market-place.
						<milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also many governments have been
					put down by some of their members who had become resentful because the
					oligarchies were too despotic; this is how the oligarchies fell at <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						1305b 13 n.</note> and at <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>.
					And revolutions also occur from an accident, both in what is called a
					constitutional government and in those oligarchies in which membership of the
					council and the law-courts and tenure of the other offices are based on a
					property-qualification. For often the qualification first having been fixed to
					suit the circumstances of the time, so that in an oligarchy a few may be members
					and in a constitutional government the middle classes, when peace or some other
					good fortune leads to a good harvest it comes about that the same properties
					become worth many times as large an assessment, so that all the citizens share
					in all the rights, the change sometimes taking place gradually and little by
					little and not being noticed, but at other times more quickly.<milestone n="5.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such then
					are the causes that lead to revolutions and factions in oligarchies
					&lpar;and generally, both democracies and oligarchies are sometimes altered
					not into the opposite forms of constitution but into ones of the same class, for
						instance<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>from legitimate
					democracies and oligarchies into autocratic ones and from the latter into the
						former&rpar;.<milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In aristocracies factions arise in some cases because
					few men share in the honors &lpar;which has also been said<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1306a 13 ff.</note> to be the cause of
					disturbances in oligarchies, because an aristocracy too is a sort of oligarchy,
					for in both those who govern are few&mdash;although the reason for this is
					not the same in both&mdash;since this does cause it to be thought that

					constitutional governments and aristocracies is mostly due to a departure from
					justice in the actual framework of the constitution. For what starts it in the
					case of a constitutional government is that it does not contain a good blend of
					democracy and oligarchy; and in the case of an aristocracy it is the lack of a
					good blend of those two elements and of virtue, but chiefly of the two elements
					&lpar;I mean popular government and oligarchy&rpar;, for both
					constitutional governments and most of the constitutions that are called
					aristocracies aim at blending these. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. their mode of blending
						oligarchy and democracy.</note> is the point of distinction between
					aristocracies and what are called constitutional governments, and it is owing to
					this that some of them<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The writer loosely
						speaks of aristocracies and polities as a single class, differing only in
						degree of concentration of power in the hands of the upper classes.</note>
					are less and others more stable; for the constitutions inclining more towards
					oligarchy men call aristocracies and those inclining more to the side of the
					multitude constitutional governments, owing to which those of the latter sort
					are more secure than the others, for the greater number is the stronger, and
					also men are more content when they have an equal amount, whereas the owners of
					wealthy properties, if the constitution gives them the superior
						position,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>seek to behave
					insolently and to gain money. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					speaking broadly, to whichever side the constitution leans, that is the side to
					which it shifts as either of the two parties increases its own side&mdash;a
					constitutional government shifts to democracy and an aristocracy to oligarchy,
					or to the opposite extremes, that is, aristocracy to democracy &lpar;for the
					poorer people feeling they are unjustly treated pull it round to the
					opposite&rpar; and constitutional governments to oligarchy &lpar;for the
					only lasting thing is equality in accordance with desert and the possession of
					what is their own&rpar;. <milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the
					change mentioned<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. from aristocracy to
						democracy. Possibly these events occurred after the defeat of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> in <date value="-413">413</date> B.C., when the Athenian party at <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName> was banished &lpar;Lysias

					came about at <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName>, for because
					the property-qualification for honors was too high, the constitution was altered
					to a lower property-qualification and to a larger number of official posts, but
					because the notables illegally bought up the whole of the land &lpar;for the
					constitution was too oligarchical, so that they were able to grasp at
					wealth&rpar; . . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Probably a clause
						meaning &lsquo;civil strife ensued&rsquo; has been lost.</note> And
					the people having been trained in the war overpowered the guards, until those
					who were in the position of having too much land relinquished it.<milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Besides, as
					all aristocratic constitutions are inclined towards oligarchy, the notables
					grasp at wealth &lpar;for example at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> the estates are coming into a few hands&rpar;; and
					the notables have more power to do what they like, and to form marriage
					connections with whom they like &lpar;which was the cause of the fall of the
					state of <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>, as a result of the
					marriage with Dionysius,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1259a 28 n. He
						married in <date value="-397">397</date> B.C. the daughter of a Locrian
						citizen, who bore him the younger Dionysius.</note> which would not have
					taken place in a democracy; nor in a well-blended aristocracy&rpar;.
						<milestone n="1307b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And aristocracies are most liable to undergo revolution
					unobserved, through gradual relaxation, just as it has been said in what has
					gone before about all forms of constitution in general, that even a small change
					may cause a revolution. For when they give up one of the details of the
					constitution, afterwards they also make another slightly bigger change more
					readily, until they alter the whole system. <milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This occurred for instance with the constitution of
						<placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName>. There was a law that the
					office of general could be held at intervals of four years, but some of the
					younger men, becoming warlike and winning high repute with the mass of the
					guards, came to despise the men engaged in affairs, and thought that they would
					easily get control; so first they tried to repeal the law referred to, so as to
					enable the same persons to serve as generals continuously, as they saw that the
					people would vote for themselves with enthusiasm. And though the magistrates in
					charge of this matter, called the Councillors, at first made a movement to
					oppose them, they were won over, believing that after repealing this law they
					would allow the rest of the constitution to stand; but later, though they wished
					to prevent them when other laws were being repealed, they could no longer do
					anything more, but the whole system of the constitution was converted into a
					dynasty of the men who had initiated the innovations.<milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And constitutions of all
						forms<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are broken up some times
					from movements initiating from within themselves, but sometimes from outside,
					when there is an opposite form of constitution either near by or a long way off
					yet possessed of power. This used to happen in the days of the Athenians and the
					Spartans; the Athenians used to put down oligarchies everywhere and the Spartans
						democracies.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have then approximately stated
					the causes that give rise to revolutions in the constitutions of states and to
					party factions.<milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The next thing to speak about is security both in general and
					for each form of constitution separately. First then it is clear that if we know
					the causes by which constitutions are destroyed we also know the causes by which
					they are preserved; for opposites create opposites, and destruction is the
					opposite of security. In well-blended constitutions therefore, if care must be
					taken to prevent men from committing any other breach of the law, most of all
					must a small breach be guarded against, <milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for transgression of the law creeps in unnoticed, just as
					a small expenditure occurring often ruins men's estates; for the expense is not
					noticed because it does not come all at once, for the mind is led astray by the
					repeated small outlays, just like the sophistic puzzle, &lsquo;if each is
					little, then all are a little.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This is the <emph>sorites</emph>fallacy; add to one stone another, and
						another, and another&mdash;when do they make a heap &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">swro/s</foreign>&rpar;? and take away stone after
						stone&mdash;when do they cease to be a heap? Horace's &lsquo;ratio
						ruentis acerui&rsquo; &lpar;<bibl n="Hor. Ep. 2.47">Hor. Ep.
							2.47</bibl>.</note> This is true in one way but in another it is not;
					for the whole or total is not little, but made up of little parts. One thing
					therefore that we must guard against is this beginning; and the next point is
					that we must not put faith in the arguments strung together for the sake of
					tricking the multitude, <milestone n="1308a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they are refuted by the facts &lpar;and
					what sort of constitutional sophistries we refer to has been said
					before&rpar;. <milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again we must
					observe that not only some aristocracies but also some oligarchies endure not
					because the constitutions are secure but because those who get in the offices
					treat both those outside the constitution and those in the government well, on
					the one hand by not treating those who are not members of it unjustly and by
					bringing their leading men into the constitution and not wronging the ambitious
					ones in the matter of dishonor or the multitude in the matter of gain, and on
					the other hand, in relation to themselves and those who are members, by treating
					one another in a democratic spirit. For that equality which men of democratic
					spirit seek for in the case of the multitude is not only just but also expedient
					in the case of their compeers. <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence
					if there are a greater number in the governing class, many of the legislative
					enactments of a democratic nature are advantageous, for example for the offices
					to be tenable for six months, to enable all the compeers to participate in them;
					for the compeers in this case are as it were the people &lpar;owing to which
					demagogues often arise even among them, as has been said already&rpar;, and
					also oligarchies and aristocracies fall into dynasties less &lpar;for it is
					not so easy to do wrongs<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>when in
					office for a short time as when in for a long time, since it is long tenure of
					office that causes tyrannies to spring up in oligarchies and democracies; for
					either those who are the greatest men in either sort of state aim at tyranny, in
					the one sort the demagogues and in the other the dynasts, or those who hold the
					greatest offices, when they are in office for along time&rpar;. <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And constitutions are kept secure not only
					through being at a distance from destroyers but sometimes also through being
					near them,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This modifies 1207a 31.</note> for
					when they are afraid the citizens keep a closer hold on the government; hence
					those who take thought for the constitution must contrive causes of fear, in
					order that the citizens may keep guard and not relax their vigilance for the
					constitution like a watch in the night, and they must make the distant near.
					Again, they must also endeavor to guard against the quarrels and party struggles
					of the notables by means of legislation, and to keep out those who are outside
					the quarrel before they too have taken it over; since to discern a growing evil
					at the commencement is not any ordinary person's work but needs a statesman.
						<milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And to deal with the revolution
					from oligarchy and constitutional government that arises because of the
					property-qualifications, when this occurs while the rates of qualification
					remain the same but money is becoming plentiful, it is advantageous to examine
					the total amount of the rated value of the community as compared with the past
					amount, in states where the assessment is made yearly, over that period,
						<milestone n="1308b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and three years or five years ago in the larger states, and if
					the new total is many times larger or many times smaller than the former one at
					the time when the rates qualifying for citizenship were fixed, it is
					advantageous that there should be a law for the magistrates correspondingly to
					tighten up or to relax the rates, tightening them up in proportion to the ratio
					of increase if the new total rated value exceeds the old, and relaxing them and
					making the qualification lower if the new total falls below the old. <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in oligarchies and constitutional
					states, when they do not do this, in the one case<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. if the total valuation has decreased.</note> the result
					is that in the latter an oligarchy comes into existence and in the former a
					dynasty, and in the other case<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. if the
						total has increased.</note> a constitutional government turns into a
					democracy and an oligarchy into a constitutional government or a government of
					the people. But it is a policy common to democracy and oligarchy &lsqb;and
					to monarchy&rsqb;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some MSS. and many
						editors omit these words.</note> and every form of constitution not to raise
					up any man too much beyond due proportion, but rather to try to assign small
					honors and of long tenure or great ones quickly<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The text should probably be emended &lsquo;with a short
						tenure.&rsquo;</note> &lpar;for officials grow corrupt, and not
					every man can bear good fortune&rpar;, or if not, at all events not to
					bestow honors in clusters and take them away again in clusters, but by a gradual
					process; <milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and best of all to try so
					to regulate people by the law that there may be nobody among them specially
					pre-eminent in power due to friends or wealth, or, failing this, to cause their
					periods out of office to be spent abroad.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And since men also cause revolutions through their private
					lives, some magistracy must be set up to inspect those whose mode of living is
					unsuited to the constitution&mdash;unsuited to democracy in a democracy, to
					oligarchy in an oligarchy, and similarly for each of the other forms of
					constitution. And also sectional prosperity in the state must be guarded against
					for the same reasons; and the way to avert this is always to entrust business
					and office to the opposite sections &lpar;I mean that the respectable are
					opposite to the multitude and the poor to the wealthy&rpar;, and to endeavor
					either to mingle together the multitude of the poor and that of the wealthy or
					to increase the middle class &lpar;for this dissolves party factions due to
					inequality&rpar;. <milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in every
					form of constitution it is a very great thing for it to be so framed both by its
					laws and by its other institutions that it is impossible for the magistracies to
					make a profit. And this has most to be guarded against in oligarchies; for the
					many are not so much annoyed at being excluded from holding office &lpar;but
					in fact they are glad if somebody lets them have leisure to spend on their own
					affairs&rpar; as they are if they think that the magistrates are stealing
					the common funds, but then both things annoy them, exclusion from the honors of
					office and exclusion from its profits. <milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And indeed the sole way in which a combination of
					democracy and aristocracy is possible is if someone could contrive this
						arrangement<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. render it impossible to
						make money out of office</note>; <milestone n="1309a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for it would then be possible
					for the notables and also the multitude both to have what they want; for it is
					the democratic principle for all to have the right to hold office and the
					aristocratic one for the offices to be filled by the notables, and this will be
					the case when it is impossible to make money from office; for the poor will not
					want to hold office because of making nothing out of it, but rather to attend to
					their own affairs, while the wealthy will be able to hold office because they
					have no need to add to their resources from the public funds; so that the result
					will be that the poor will become well-off through spending their time upon
					their work, and the notables will not be governed by any casual persons.
						<milestone n="7.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore to prevent peculation
					of the public property, let the transfer of the funds take place in the presence
					of all the citizens, and let copies of the lists be deposited for each
						brotherhood,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Groups of citizens normally
						three to a tribe, supposed to be based on relationship.</note> company<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Originally a military, later a civil
						classification.</note> and tribe; and to get men to hold office without
					profit there must be honors assigned by law to officials of good repute. And in
					democracies it is necessary to be sparing of the wealthy not only by not causing
					properties to be divided up, but not incomes either &lpar;which under some
					constitutions takes place unnoticed&rpar;, and it is better to prevent men
					from undertaking costly but useless public services like equipping choruses and
						torch-races<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Equipping the chorus and
						actors for tragedies and comedies and providing for the ceremonial
						torch-races were public services borne by individuals at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> and all other similar
					services, even if they wish to;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="7.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>in an oligarchy on the other
					hand it is necessary to take much care of the poor, and to allot to them the
					offices of profit, and the penalty if one of the rich commits an outrage against
					them must be greater than if it is done by one of themselves,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly &lsquo;than if he does it
						against one of his own class.&rsquo;</note> and inheritance must not go
					by bequest but by family, and the same man must not inherit more than one
					estate, for so estates would be more on a level, and more of the poor would
					establish themselves as prosperous. <milestone n="7.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is expedient both in a democracy and in an oligarchy to assign to those
					who have a smaller share in the government&mdash;in a democracy to the
					wealthy and in an oligarchy to the poor&mdash;either equality or precedence
					in all other things excepting the supreme offices of state; but these should be
					entrusted to those prescribed by the constitution exclusively, or to them for
					the most part.<milestone n="7.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There are some three qualities which those who are to hold the
					supreme magistracies ought to possess, first, loyalty to the established
					constitution, next, very great capacity to do the duties of the office, and
					third, virtue and justice&mdash;in each constitution the sort of justice
					suited to the constitution &lpar;for if the rules of justice are not the
					same under all constitutions, it follows that there must be differences in the
					nature of justice also&rpar;. It is a difficult question how the choice
					ought to be made when it happens that all these qualities are not found in the
					same person; <milestone n="1309b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for instance, if one man is a good military commander but a bad
					man and no friend of the constitution, and the other is just and loyal, how
					should the choice be made? <milestone n="7.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It seems
					that two things ought to be considered, what is the quality of which all men
					have a larger share, and what the one of which all have a smaller share?
					Therefore in the case of military command one must consider experience more than
					virtue, for men have a smaller share of military experience and a larger share
					of moral goodness; but in the case of a trusteeship or a stewardship the
					opposite, for these require more virtue than most men possess, but the knowledge
					required is common to all men. And somebody might raise the question, why is
					virtue needed if both capacity and loyalty to the constitution are forthcoming,
					as even these two qualities will do what is suitable? May not the answer be,
					because those who possess these two qualities may possibly lack self-control, so
					that just as they do not serve themselves well although they know how to and
					although they love themselves, so possibly in some cases they may behave in this
					way in regard to the community also? <milestone n="7.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And broadly, whatever provisions in the laws we describe as advantageous to
					constitutions, these are all preservative of the constitutions, and so is the
					supreme elementary principle that has been often stated, that of taking
					precautions that the section desirous of the constitution shall be stronger in
					numbers than the section not desirous off it. And beside all these matters one
					thing must not be overlooked which at present is overlooked by the,
						deviation-forms<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1279a 20.</note> of
					constitution&mdash;the middle party;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for many of the institutions thought to be popular destroy
					democracies, and many of those thought oligarchical destroy oligarchies.
						<milestone n="7.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the adherents of the
					deviation-form, thinking that this form is the only right thing, drag it to
					excess, not knowing that just as there can be a nose that although deviating
					from the most handsome straightness towards being hooked or snub nevertheless is
					still beautiful and agreeable to look at, yet all the same, if a sculptor
					carries it still further in the direction of excess, he will first lose the
					symmetry of the feature and finally will make it not even look like a nose at
					all, because of its excess and deficiency in the two opposite qualities
					&lpar;and the same is the ease also in regard to the other parts of the
					body&rpar;, so this is what happens about constitutions likewise; <milestone n="7.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is possible for an oligarchy and a
					democracy to be satisfactory although they have diverged from the best
					structure, but if one strains either of them further, first he will make the
					constitution worse, and finally he will make it not a constitution at all.
					Therefore the legislator and the statesman must not fail to know what sort of
					democratic institutions save and what destroy a democracy, and what sort of
					oligarchical institutions an oligarchy; for neither constitution can exist and
					endure without the well-to-do and the multitude, but when an even level of
					property comes about, the constitution resulting must of necessity be another
					one, <milestone n="1310a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so that when men destroy these classes by laws carried to
					excess they destroy the constitutions. <milestone n="7.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And a mistake is made both in democracies and in
					oligarchies&mdash;in democracies by the demagogues, where the multitude is
					supreme over the laws; for they always divide the state into two by fighting
					with the well-to-do, but they ought on the contrary always to pretend to be
					speaking on behalf of men that are well-to-do, while in democracies the
					oligarchical statesmen ought to pretend to be speaking on behalf of the people,
					and the oligarchics ought to take oath in terms exactly opposite to those which
					they use now, for at present in some oligarchies they swear, &ldquo;And I
					will be hostile to the people and will plan whatever evil I can against
						them,&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The &lsquo;scoffing
						anapaestic cadence&rsquo; of this oath has been noted. In <date value="-411">411</date> B.C. the democratic reaction at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> swore &lsquo;to be enemies
						of the Four Hundred and to hold no parley with them.&rsquo;</note> but
					they ought to hold, and to act the part of holding, the opposite notion,
					declaring in their oaths, &ldquo;I will not wrong the people.&rdquo;
						<milestone n="7.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the greatest of all the
					means spoken of to secure the stability of constitutions is one that at present
					all people despise: it is a system of education suited to the constitutions. For
					there is no use in the most valuable laws, ratified by the unanimous judgement
					of the whole body of citizens, if these are not trained and educated in the
					constitution, popularly if the laws are popular, oligarchically if they are
					oligarchical; for there is such a thing as want of self-discipline in a state,
					as well as in an individual.<milestone n="7.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But to
					have been educated<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to suit the
					constitution does not mean to do the things that give pleasure to the adherents
					of oligarchy or to the supporters of democracy, but the things that will enable
					the former to govern oligarchically and the latter to govern themselves
					democratically. But at present in the oligarchies the sons of the rulers are
					luxurious, and the sons of the badly-off become trained by exercise and labor,
					so that they are both more desirous of reform and more able to bring it about;
						<milestone n="7.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>while in the democracies
					thought to be the most democratic the opposite of what is expedient has come
					about. And the cause of this is that they define liberty wrongly &lpar;for
					there are two things that are thought to be defining features of democracy, the
					sovereignty of the majority and liberty&rpar;; for justice is supposed to be
					equality, and equality the sovereignty of what ever may have been decided by the
					multitude, and liberty doing just what one likes. Hence in democracies of this
					sort everybody lives as he likes, and &lsquo;unto what end he
					listeth,&rsquo; as Euripides<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Fragment
						883, from an unknown play.</note> says. But this is bad; for to live in
					conformity with the constitution ought not to be considered slavery but
						safety.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This therefore, speaking broadly, is a
					list of the things that cause the alteration and the destruction of
					constitutions, and of those that cause their &ldquo;security and
						continuance.&rdquo;<milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It remains to speak of monarchy, the causes
					that destroy it and the natural means of its preservation. <milestone n="1310b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And the things
					that happen about royal governments and tyrannies are almost similar to those
					that have been narrated about constitutional governments. For royal government
					corresponds with aristocracy, while tyranny is a combination of the last form of
						oligarchy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1296a 3, 1312b 35.</note>
					and of democracy; and for that very reason it is most harmful to its subjects,
					inasmuch as it is a combination of two bad things, and is liable to the
					deviations and errors that spring from both forms of constitution. <milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And these two different sorts of monarchy
					have their origins from directly opposite sources; royalty has come into
					existence for the assistance of the distinguished against the people, and a king
					is appointed from those distinguished by superiority in virtue or the actions
					that spring from virtue, or by superiority in coming from a family of that
					character, while a tyrant is set up from among the people and the multitude to
					oppose the notables, in order that the people may suffer no injustice from them.
						<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And this is manifest from the
					facts of history. For almost the greatest number of tyrants have risen, it may
					be said, from being demagogues, having won the people's confidence by slandering
					the notables. For some tyrannies were set up in this manner when the states had
					already grown great, but others that came before them arose from kings departing
					from the ancestral customs and aiming at a more despotic rule,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and others from the men elected to fill the supreme
					magistracies &lpar;for in old times the peoples used to appoint the popular
						officials<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Here <foreign lang="greek">dhmiourgi/a</foreign> means &lsquo;magistracy&rsquo; generally;
							<foreign lang="greek">dhmiourgo/s</foreign> was the title of a special
						officer in some Peloponnesian states.</note> and the sacred embassies<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Official missions to religious games and to
						oracles.</note> for long terms of office&rpar;, and others from
					oligarchies electing some one supreme official for the greatest magistracies.
						<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in all these methods they
					had it in their power to effect their purpose easily, if only they wished,
					because they already possessed the power of royal rule in the one set of cases
					and of their honorable office in the other, for example Phidon in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps circa <date value="-750">750</date> B.C.</note> and others became

					with aristocracy, for it goes by merit, either by private virtue or by family or
					by services or by a combination of these things and ability. For in every
					instance this honor fell to men after they had conferred benefit or because they
					had the ability to confer benefit on their cities or their nations, some having
					prevented their enslavement in war, for instance Codrus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The usual tradition was that Codrus was already king when he

						<milestone n="1311a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to protect the owners of estates from suffering injustice and
					the people from suffering insult, but tyranny, as has repeatedly been said, pays
					regard to no common interest unless for the sake of its private benefit; and the
					aim of tyranny is what is pleasant, that of royalty what is noble. Hence even in
					their requisitions money is the aim of tyrants but rather marks of honor that of
					kings; and a king's body-guard consists of citizens, a tyrant's of foreign
					mercenaries. <milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is manifest that
					tyranny has the evils of both democracy and oligarchy; it copies oligarchy in
					making wealth its object &lpar;for inevitably that is the only way in which
					the tyrant's body-guard and his luxury can be kept up&rpar; and in putting
					no trust in the multitude &lpar;which is why they resort to the measure of
					stripping the people of arms, and why ill-treatment of the mob and its expulsion
					from the city and settlement in scattered places is common to both forms of
					government, both oligarchy and tyranny&rpar;, while it copies democracy in
					making war on the notables and destroying them secretly and openly and banishing
					them as plotting against it and obstructive to its rule. For it is from them
					that counter-movements actually spring, some of them wishing themselves to rule,
					and others not<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to be slaves. Hence
					comes the advice of Periander to Thrasybulus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1284a 26 n.</note> his docking of the prominent cornstalks, meaning
					that the prominent citizens must always be made away with.<milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Therefore, as was
					virtually stated,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This has not been stated,
						but can be inferred from what precedes.</note> the causes of revolutions in
					constitutional and in royal governments must be deemed to be the same; for
					subjects in many cases attack monarchies because of unjust treatment and fear
					and contempt, and among the forms of unjust treatment most of all because of
					insolence, and sometimes the cause is the seizure of private property. Also the
					objects aimed at by the revolutionaries in the case both of tyrannies and of
					royal governments are the same as in revolts against constitutional government;
					for monarchs possess great wealth and great honor, which are desired by all men.
						<milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in some cases the attack is
					aimed at the person of the rulers, in others at their office. Risings provoked
					by insolence are aimed against the person; and though insolence has many
					varieties, each of them gives rise to anger, and when men are angry they mostly
					attack for the sake of revenge, not of ambition. For example the attack on the
					Pisistratidae took place because they outraged Harmodius's sister and treated
					Harmodius with contumely &lpar;for Harmodius attacked them because of his
					sister and Aristogiton because of Harmodius, and also the plot was laid against
					Periander the tyrant in <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1304a 31
						n.</note> because when drinking <milestone n="1311b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>with his favorite he asked him
					if he was yet with child by him&rpar;,<milestone n="8.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the attack on Philip by Pausanias<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A Macedonian youth of family, who murdered Philip <date value="-336">336</date> B.C. Attalus was the uncle of Philip's wife
						Cleopatra.</note> was because he allowed him to be insulted by Attalus and
					his friends, and that on Amyntas the Little<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the adjective should be transferred to Derdas and expunged as an
						interpolated note. The persons referred to are uncertain.</note> by Derdas
					because he mocked at his youth, and the attack of the eunuch on Evagoras of
						<placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> was for revenge, for he
					murdered him as being insulted, because Evagoras's son had taken away his wife.
						<milestone n="8.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And many risings have also
					occurred because of shameful personal indignities committed by certain monarchs.
					One instance is the attack of Crataeas on Archelaus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">King of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>
						<dateRange from="-413" to="-399">413</dateRange>-399 B.C. Euripides went to
						reside at his court <date value="-408">408</date> B.C. and died there <date value="-406">406</date> B.C. at the age of 75.</note>; for he was always
					resentful of the association, so that even a smaller excuse became sufficient,
					or perhaps it was because he did not give him the hand of one of his daughters
					after agreeing to do so, but gave the elder to the king of Elimea when hard
					pressed in a war against Sirras and Arrabaeus, and the younger to his son
					Amyntas, thinking that thus Amyntas would be least likely to quarrel with his
					son by Cleopatra; but at all events Crataeas's estrangement was primarily caused
					by resentment because of the love affair. <milestone n="8.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And Hellanocrates of <placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> also joined in the attack for the same reason; for
					because while enjoying his favors Archelaus would not restore him to his home
					although he had promised to do so, he thought that the motive of the familiarity
					that had taken place<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>had been
					insolence and not passionate desire. And <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> and Heraclides of <placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName> made away with Cotys<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">King of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>
						<dateRange from="-382" to="-358">382</dateRange>-358 B.C.</note> to avenge
					their father, and Adamas revolted from Cotys because he had been mutilated by
					him when a boy, on the ground of the insult. <milestone n="8.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also many men when enraged by the indignity of
					corporal chastisement have avenged the insult by destroying or attempting to
					destroy its author, even when a magistrate or member of a royal dynasty. For
					example when the Penthilidae<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The ruling
						family in the early oligarchy there, claiming descent from Penthilus, an
						illegitimate son of Orestes.</note> at <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName> went about striking people with their staves Megacles
					with his friends set on them and made away with them, and afterwards Smerdis
					when he had been beaten and dragged out from his wife's presence killed
					Penthilus. Also Decamnichus took a leading part in the attack upon Archelaus,
					being the first to stir on the attackers; and the cause of his anger was that he
					had handed him over to Euripides the poet to flog, Euripides being angry because
					he had made a remark about his breath smelling. <milestone n="8.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And many others also for similar reasons have been made
					away with or plotted against. And similarly also from the motive of fear; for
					this was one of the causes we mentioned in the case of monarchies, as also in
					that of constitutional governments; for instance Artapanes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Captain of Xerxes' body-guard.</note> killed Xerxes fearing
					the charge about Darius, because he had hanged him when Xerxes had ordered him
					not to but he had thought that he would forgive him because he would forget, as
					he had been at dinner. And other attacks on monarchs have been on account of
					contempt, <milestone n="1312a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as somebody killed Sardanapallus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Last king of the Assyrian empire at <placeName key="tgn,7017998">Nineveh</placeName>.</note> when he saw him combing
					his hair with his women &lpar;if this story told by the narrators of legends
					is true&mdash;and if it did not happen with Sardanapallus, it might quite
					well be true of somebody else&rpar;, and <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName> attacked the younger Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> 367-356 and <dateRange from="-346" to="-343">346</dateRange>-343 B.C., cf. 1312a 34 ff.</note> because he despised
					him, when he saw the citizens despising him and the king himself always drunk.
						<milestone n="8.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And contempt has led some even
					of the friends of monarchs to attack them, for they despise them for trusting
					them and think they will not be found out. And contempt is in a manner the
					motive of those who attack monarchs thinking that they are able to seize the
					government; for they make the attempt with a light heart, feeling that they have
					the power and because of their power despising the danger, as generals
					commanding the armies attack their monarchs; for instance Cyrus attacked
						Astyages<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The last king of Media, reigned
							<dateRange from="-594" to="-559">594</dateRange>-559 B.C.</note> when he
					despised both his mode of life and his power, because his power had waned and he
					himself was living luxuriously, and the Thracian Seuthes attacked Amadocus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Both these Thracian kings became allies of
							<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
						<date value="-390">390</date> B.C., but the event referred to may be
						later.</note> when his general. Others again attack monarchs for more than
					one of these motives, for instance both because they despise them and for the
					sake of gain, as Mithridates<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps
						Mithridates II., who succeeded his father Ariobarzanes as satrap of
							<placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>
						<date value="-336">336</date> B.C.</note> attacked Ariobarzanes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The following sentence may have been shifted
						by mistake from the end of 8.14 above.</note> And it is men of bold nature
					and who hold a military office with monarchs who most often make the attempt for
					this reason; for courage possessing power is boldness,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and they make their attacks thinking that with
					courage and power they will easily prevail. <milestone n="8.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But with those whose attack is prompted by ambition the
					motive operates in a different way from those spoken of before; some men attack
					tyrants because they see great profits and great honors belonging to them, but
					that is not the reason that in each case leads the persons who attack from
					motives of ambition to resolve on the venture; those others are led by the
					motive stated, but these attack monarchs from a wish to gain not monarchy but
					glory, just as they would wish to take part in doing any other uncommon deed
					that makes men famous and known to their fellows. <milestone n="8.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Not but what those who make the venture from this motive
					are very few indeed in number, for underlying it there must be an utter
					disregard of safety, if regard for safety is not to check the enterprise; they
					must always have present in their minds the opinion of <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>, although it is not easy for many men to
					have it; <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName> marched with a small
					force against Dionysius, saying that his feeling was that, whatever point he
					might be able to get to, it would be enough for him to have had that much share
					in the enterprise&mdash;for instance, if it should befall him to die as soon
					as he had just set foot in the country, that death would satisfy him.<milestone n="8.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And one way
					in which tyranny is destroyed, as is each of the other forms of constitution
					also, is from without, <milestone n="1312b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>if some state with an opposite constitution is
					stronger &lpar;for the wish to destroy it will clearly be present in such a
					neighbor because of the opposition of principle, and all men do what they wish
					if they have the power&rpar;&mdash;and the constitutions opposed to
					tyranny are, on the one hand democracy, which is opposed to it as &lpar;in
					Hesiod's phrase<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Hes. WD 25">Hes. WD
							25</bibl><foreign lang="greek">kai\ kerameu\s keramei= kote/ei kai\
							te/ktoni te/ktwn</foreign>, &lsquo;two of a trade never
						agree.&rsquo;</note>&rpar; &lsquo;potter to potter,&rsquo;
					because the final form of democracy is tyranny, and on the other hand royalty
					and aristocracy are opposed to tyranny because of the opposite nature of their
					constitutional structure &lpar;owing to which the Spartans put down a very
					great many tyrannies, and so did the Syracusans at the period when they were
					governed well.&rpar; <milestone n="8.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But one
					way is from within itself, when the partners in it fall into discord, as the
					tyranny of the family of Gelo<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Tyrant of
							<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>
						<dateRange from="-485" to="-478">485</dateRange>-478 B.C., succeeded by his
						brother Hiero who died 467. Gelo's son is unknown. Cf. 1315b 35 ff.</note>
					was destroyed, and in modern times<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><date value="-356">356</date> B.C., a good many years before this book was
						written.</note> that of the family of Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1312a 4 n.</note>&mdash;Gelo's, when Thrasybulus the
					brother of Hiero paid court to the son of Gelo and urged him into indulgences in
					order that he himself might rule, and the son's connections banded together a
					body of confederates in order that the tyranny might not be put down entirely
					but only Thrasybulus, but their confederates seizing the opportunity expelled
					them all; Dionysius was put down by <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>, his relative, who got the people on to his side and
					expelled him, but was afterwards killed. <milestone n="8.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There are two causes that chiefly lead men to attack
					tyranny, hatred and contempt; the former, hatred,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>attaches to tyrants always, but it is their being despised that
					causes their downfall in many cases. A proof of this is that most of those that
					have won tyrannies have also kept their offices to the end, but those that have
					inherited them almost all lose them at once; for they live a life of indulgence,
					and so become despicable and also give many opportunities to their attackers.
						<milestone n="8.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And also anger must be counted
					as an element in the hatred felt for them, for in a way it occasions the same
					actions. And often it is even more active than hatred, since angry men attack
					more vigorously because passion does not employ calculation &lpar;and
					insolence most frequently causes men to be led by their angry tempers, which was
					the cause of the fall of the tyranny of the Pisistratidae and many
					others&rpar;, but hatred calculates more; for anger brings with it an
					element of pain, making calculation difficult, but enmity is not accompanied by
					pain. And to speak summarily, all the things that we have mentioned as causing
					the down fall of unmixed and extreme oligarchy and of the last form of democracy
					must be counted as destructive of tyranny as well, since extreme oligarchy and
					democracy are in reality divided<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. divided
						among several persons, &lsquo;put into commission.&rsquo;</note>
					tyrannies. <milestone n="8.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Royal government on the
					other hand is very seldom destroyed by external causes, so that it is
					long-lasting; but in most cases its destruction arises out of itself. And it is
					destroyed in two ways, <milestone n="1313a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>one when those who participate in it quarrel, and
					another when the kings try to administer the government too tyrannically,
					claiming to exercise sovereignty in more things and contrary to the law. Royal
					governments do not occur any more now, but if ever monarchies do occur they are
					rather tyrannies, because royalty is government over willing subjects but with
					sovereignty over greater matters, but men of equal quality are numerous and no
					one is so outstanding as to fit the magnitude and dignity of the office; so that
					for this reason the subjects do not submit willingly, and if a man has made
					himself ruler by deception or force, then this is thought to be a tyranny.
						<milestone n="8.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In cases of hereditary royalty
					we must also set down a cause of their destruction, in addition to those
					mentioned, the fact that hereditary kings often become despicable, and that
					although possessing not the power of a tyrant but the dignity of a king they
					commit insolent outrages; for the deposition of kings used to be easy, since a
					king will at once cease to be king if his subjects do not wish him to be,
					whereas a tyrant will still be tyrant even though his subjects do not wish
						it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These causes then and others of the same
					nature are those that bring about the destruction of monarchies.<milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On the other
					hand it is clear that monarchies, speaking generally, are preserved in safety as
					a result of the opposite causes to those by which they are destroyed. But taking
					the different sorts of monarchy separately&mdash;royalties are preserved by
					bringing them<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>into a more moderate
					form; for the fewer powers the kings have, the longer time the office in its
					entirety must last, for they themselves become less despotic and more equal to
					their subjects in temper, and their subjects envy them less. For this was the
					cause of the long persistence of the Molossian royalty, and that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> has continued because the office was
					from the beginning divided into two halves, and because it was again limited in
					various ways by Theopompus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">King of
							<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> circa <dateRange from="-770" to="-720">770</dateRange>-720 B.C.</note> in particular by
					his instituting the office of the ephors to keep a check upon it; for by taking
					away some of the kings' power he increased the permanence of the royal office,
					so that in a manner he did not make it less but greater. This indeed as the
					story goes is what he said in reply to his wife, when she asked if he felt no
					shame in bequeathing the royal power to his sons smaller than he had inherited
					it from his father: &ldquo;Indeed I do not,&rdquo; he is said to have
					answered, &ldquo;for I hand it on more lasting.&rdquo;<milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Tyrannies on the
					other hand are preserved in two extremely opposite ways. One of these is the
					traditional way and the one in which most tyrants administer their office. Most
					of these ordinary safeguards of tyranny are said to have been instituted by
						Periander<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1284a 26 n.</note> of
						<placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and also many such
					devices may be borrowed from the Persian empire. These are both the measures
					mentioned some time back to secure the safety of a tyranny as far as
					possible&mdash;the lopping off of outstanding men and the destruction of the
					proud,&mdash;and also the prohibition of common meals and club-fellowship
					and education and all other things of this nature, <milestone n="1313b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in fact the close
					watch upon all things that usually engender the two emotions of pride and
					confidence, and the prevention of the formation of study-circles and other
					conferences for debate,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The phrases cover
						Plato's gatherings in the Academy, Aristotle's in the Peripatos of the
						Lyceum, and other meetings for the intellectual use of leisure in gymnasia,
						palaestrae and leschae.</note> and the employment of every means that will
					make people as much as possible unknown to one another &lpar;for familiarity
					increases mutual confidence&rpar;; <milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and for the people in the city to be always visible and to
					hang about the palace-gates &lpar;for thus there would be least concealment
					about what they are doing, and they would get into a habit of being humble from
					always acting in a servile way&rpar;; and all the other similar devices of
					Persian and barbarian tyranny &lpar;for all have the same effect&rpar;;
					and to try not to be uninformed about any chance utterances or actions of any of
					the subjects, but to have spies like the women called
					&lsquo;provocatrices&rsquo; at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and the &lsquo;sharp-ears&rsquo; that used to
					be sent out by Hiero wherever there was any gathering or conference
					&lpar;for when men are afraid of spies of this sort they keep a check on
					their tongues, and if they do speak freely are less likely not to be found
					out&rpar;; <milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and to set men at
					variance with one another and cause quarrels between friend and friend and
					between the people and the notables and among the rich. And it is a device of
					tyranny to make the subjects poor, so that a guard<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently this means a citizen force side by side with the
						tyrant's mercenaries; a variant gives &lsquo;in order that the
						&lpar;tyrant's&rpar; guard may be kept.&rsquo;</note><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>may not be kept, and also that the people
					being busy with their daily affairs may not have leisure to plot against their
					ruler. Instances of this are the pyramids in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and the votive offerings of the Cypselids,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cypselus and his son Periander &lpar;1310b

					&lpar;for in the reign of Dionysius<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						1259a 28 n.</note> the result of taxation used to be that in five years men
					had contributed the whole of their substance&rpar;. Also the tyrant is a
					stirrer-up of war, with the deliberate purpose of keeping the people busy and
					also of making them constantly in need of a leader. Also whereas friends are a
					means of security to royalty, it is a mark of a tyrant to be extremely
					distrustful of his friends, on the ground that, while all have the wish, these
					chiefly have the power. <milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the
					things that occur in connection with the final form of democracy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1309b 27 ff.</note> are all favorable to
					tyranny&mdash;dominance of women in the homes, in order that they may carry
					abroad reports against the men, and lack of discipline among the slaves, for the
					same reason; for slaves and women do not plot against tyrants, and also, if they
					prosper under tyrannies, must feel well-disposed to them, and to democracies as
					well &lpar;for the common people also wishes to be sole ruler&rpar;.
					Hence also the flatterer is in honor with both&mdash;with democracies the
					demagogue &lpar;for the demagogue is a flatterer of the people&rpar;,
					and with the tyrants those who associate with them humbly, which is the task of
					flattery. <milestone n="1314a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>In fact owing to this tyranny is a friend of the base; for
					tyrants enjoy being flattered, but nobody would ever flatter them if he
					possessed a free spirit&mdash;men of character love their ruler, or at all
					events do not flatter him. And the base are useful for base business, for nail
					is driven out by nail, as the proverb goes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The proverb <foreign lang="greek">h(lw=| h(=los e)kkrou/etai</foreign>
						usually meant driving out something by a thing of the same kind

						as here the execution of evil designs by appropriate agents.</note>
					<milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is a mark of a tyrant to
					dislike anyone that is proud or free-spirited; for the tyrant claims for himself
					alone the right to bear that character, and the man who meets his pride with
					pride and shows a free spirit robs tyranny of its superiority and position of
					mastery; tyrants therefore hate the proud as undermining their authority. And it
					is a mark of a tyrant to have men of foreign extraction rather than citizens as
					guests at table and companions, feeling that citizens are hostile but strangers
					make no claim against him.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. do not claim
						honors as against their patron, claim to be his equals.</note> These and
					similar habits are characteristic of tyrants and preservative of their office,
					but they lack no element of baseness. <milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And broadly speaking, they are all included under three heads; for tyranny
					aims at three things, one to keep its subjects humble &lpar;for a
					humble-spirited man would not plot against anybody&rpar;, second to have
					them continually distrust one another &lpar;for a tyranny is not destroyed
					until some men come to trust each other, owing to which tyrants also make war on
					the respectable, as detrimental<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to
					their rule not only because of their refusal to submit to despotic rule, but
					also because they are faithful to one another and to the other citizens, and do
					not inform against one another nor against the others&rpar;; and the third
					is lack of power for political action &lpar;since nobody attempts
					impossibilities, so that nobody tries to put down a tyranny if he has not power
					behind him&rpar;. <milestone n="9.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These then in
					fact are the three aims to which the wishes of tyrants are directed; for all the
					measures taken by tyrants one might class under these principles&mdash;some
					are designed to prevent mutual confidence among the subjects, others to curtail
					their power, and others to make them humble-spirited.<milestone n="9.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such then is the nature of
					one method by which security is obtained for tyrannies. The other tries to
					operate in a manner almost the opposite of the devices mentioned. And it can be
					ascertained from considering the downfall of royal governments. For just as one
					mode of destroying royalty is to make its government more tyrannical, so a mode
					of securing tyranny is to make it more regal, protecting one thing only, its
					power, in order that the ruler may govern not only with the consent of the
					subjects but even without it; for if he gives up this, he also gives up his
					position as tyrant. But while this must stand as a fundamental principle, all
					the other measures he may either adopt or pretend to adopt by cleverly acting
					the royal part. <milestone n="9.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The first step is
					to be careful of the public funds, <milestone n="1314b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>not squandering presents such as
					the multitudes resent, when tyrants take money from the people themselves while
					they toil and labor in penury and lavish it on mistresses and foreigners and
					craftsmen, and also rendering account of receipts and expenditure, as some
					tyrants have done already &lpar;for this careful management would make a
					ruler seem a steward of the state and not a tyrant, and he need not be afraid of
					ever being at a loss for funds while he is master of the state; <milestone n="9.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>on the contrary, for those tyrants who go
					abroad on foreign campaigns this is actually more expedient than to leave their
					money there collected into one sum, for there is less fear of those guarding it
					making an attempt on power; since for tyrants campaigning abroad the keepers of
					the treasury are more to be feared than the citizens, for the citizens go abroad
					with him but the others stay at home&rpar;. Secondly he must be seen to
					collect his taxes and benevolences for purposes of administration and to meet
					his occasional requirements for military emergencies, and generally must pose as
					guardian and steward as it were of a public fund and not a private estate.
						<milestone n="9.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And his bearing must not be
					harsh but dignified, and also such as to inspire not fear but rather
						respect<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in those who encounter
					him, though this is not easy to achieve if he is a contemptible personality; so
					that even if he neglects the other virtues he is bound to cultivate military
					valor, and to make himself a reputation as a soldier. And further more not only
					must he himself be known not to outrage any of his subjects, either boy or girl,
					but so also must everybody about him, and also their wives must similarly show
					respect towards the other women, since even the insolences of women have caused
					the fall of many tyrannies. <milestone n="9.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in
					regard to bodily enjoyments he must do the opposite of what some tyrants do now
					&lpar;for they not only begin their debaucheries at daybreak and carry them
					on for many days at a time, but also wish to be seen doing so by the public, in
					order that people may admire them as fortunate and happy&rpar;, but best of
					all he must be moderate in such matters, or if not, he must at all events avoid
					displaying his indulgences to his fellows &lpar;for not the sober man but
					the drunkard is easy to attack and to despise, not the wakeful man but the
					sleeper&rpar;. <milestone n="9.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And he must do
					the opposite of almost all the things mentioned some time back, for he must lay
					out and adorn the city as if he were a trustee and not a tyrant. And further he
					must be seen always to be exceptionally zealous as regards religious observances
					&lpar;for people are less afraid of suffering any illegal treatment from men
					of this sort, <milestone n="1315a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>if they think that their ruler has religious scruples and pays
					regard to the gods, and also they plot against him less, thinking that he has
					even the gods as allies&rpar;, though he should not display a foolish
					religiosity. <milestone n="9.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And he must pay such
					honor to those who display merit in any matter that they may think that they
					could never be more honored by the citizens if they were in dependent; and
					honors of this kind he should bestow in person, but inflict his punishments by
					the agency of other magistrates and law-courts. And it is a protection common to
					every sort of monarchy to make no one man great, but if necessary to exalt
					several &lpar;for they will keep watch on one another&rpar;, and if
					after all the ruler has to elevate an individual, at all events not take a man
					of bold spirit &lpar;for such a character is most enterprising in all
					undertakings&rpar;; and if he thinks fit to remove somebody from his power,
					to do this by gradual stages and not take away the whole of his authority at
					once. <milestone n="9.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again he should carefully
					avoid all forms of outrage, and two beyond all, violent bodily punishments and
					outrage of the young. And this caution must especially be exercised in relation
					to the ambitious, for while to be slighted in regard to property annoys the
					lovers of wealth, slights that involve dishonor are what men of honorable
					ambition and high character resent.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence the tyrant should either not consort with men of this kind, or appear to
					inflict his punishments paternally and not because of contempt, and to indulge
					in the society of the young for reasons of passion, not because he has the
					power, and in general he should buy off what are thought to be dishonors by
					greater honors. <milestone n="9.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And among those who
					make attempts upon the life of a ruler the most formidable and those against
					whom the greatest precaution is needed are those that are ready to sacrifice
					their lives if they can destroy him. Hence the greatest care must be taken to
					guard against those who think that insolent outrage is being done either to
					themselves or to those who happen to be under their care; for men attacking
					under the influence of anger are reckless of themselves, as Heraclitus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The natural philosopher of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, fl. circa <date value="-513">513</date> B.C., known as <foreign lang="greek">o( skoteino/s</foreign>
						for his epigrammatic obscurity.</note> also observed when he said that anger
					was hard to combat because it would buy revenge with a life. <milestone n="9.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since states consist of two parts, the poor
					people and the rich, the most important thing is for both to think that they owe
					their safety to the government and for it to prevent either from being wronged
					by the other, but whichever class is the stronger, this must be made to be
					entirely on the side of the government, as, if this support for the tyrant's
					interests is secured, there is no need for him to institute a liberation of
					slaves or a disarming of the citizens, for one of the two parts of the state
					added to his power will be enough to make him and them stronger than their
					attackers. <milestone n="9.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But to discuss each of
					such matters separately is superfluous; for the thing to aim at is clear,
						<milestone n="1315b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that it is necessary to appear to the subjects to be not a
					tyrannical ruler but a steward and a royal governor, and not an appropriator of
					wealth but a trustee, and to pursue the moderate things of life and not its
					extravagances, and also to make the notables one's comrades and the many one's
					followers. For the result of these methods must be that not only the tyrant's
					rule will be more honorable and more enviable because he will rule nobler
					subjects and not men that have been humiliated, and will not be continually
					hated and feared, but also that his rule will endure longer, and moreover that
					he himself in his personal character will be nobly disposed towards virtue, or
					at all events half-virtuous, and not base but only half-base.<milestone n="9.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nevertheless

					For the longest-lived was the tyranny at <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, that of the sons<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. descendants; Cleisthenes was his grandson.</note> of Orthagoras and of

					this was that they treated their subjects moderately and in many matters were

					after their interests. At all events it is said that Cleisthenes placed a wreath
					on the judge who awarded the victory away from him, and some say that the
						statue<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of a seated figure in the
					market-place is a statue of the man who gave this judgement. And they say that
						Pisistratus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1305a 23 n.</note> also
					once submitted to a summons for trial before the Areopagus. <milestone n="9.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the second longest is the tyranny at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, that of the Cypselids,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">From <date value="-655">655</date> B.C.</note>
					for even this lasted seventy-three and a half years, as Cypselus was tyrant for

						Greek may be corrected to &lsquo;forty and a half&rsquo; to give the
						stated total.</note> and Psammetichus son of Gordias for three years. And
					the reasons for the permanence of this tyranny also are the same: Cypselus was a
					leader of the people and continuously throughout his period of office dispensed
					with a bodyguard; and although Periander became tyrannical, yet he was warlike.
						<milestone n="9.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The third longest tyranny is
					that of the Pisistratidae at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
					but it was not continuous; for while Pisistratus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1305a 23 n.</note> was tyrant he twice fled into exile,
					so that in a period of thirty-three years he was tyrant for seventeen years out
					of the total, and his sons for eighteen years, so that the whole duration of
					their rule was thirty-five years. Among the remaining tyrannies is the one
					connected with Hiero and Gelo<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1312b 12
						n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, but
					even this did not last many years, but only eighteen in all, for Gelo after
					being tyrant for seven years ended his life in the eighth, and Hiero ruled ten
					years, but Thrasybulus was expelled after ten months. And the usual tyrannies
					have all of them been of quite short duration.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The
					causes therefore of the destruction of constitutional governments and of
					monarchies and those again of their preservation have almost all of them been
					discussed. <milestone n="1316a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The subject of revolutions is discussed by Socrates in the
						Republic,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Plato, <title>Republic</title>,
						Bks. 8, 9 init.; the mathematical formula for the change from Aristocracy to
						Timocracy quoted here occurs at <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 546c">Plat. Rep.
							546c</bibl>&mdash;see Adam's note there.</note> but is not discussed
					well. For his account of revolution in the constitution that is the best one and
					the first does not apply to it particularly. He says that the cause is that
					nothing is permanent but everything changes in a certain cycle, and that change
					has its origin in those numbers &lsquo;whose basic ratio 4 : 3 linked with
					the number 5 gives two harmonies,&rsquo;&mdash;meaning whenever the
					number of this figure becomes cubed,&mdash;in the belief that nature
					sometimes engenders men that are evil, and too strong for education to
					influence&mdash;speaking perhaps not ill as far as this particular dictum
					goes &lpar;for it is possible that there are some persons incapable of being
					educated and becoming men of noble character&rpar;, but why should this
					process of revolution belong to the constitution which Socrates speaks of as the
					best, more than to all the other forms of constitution, and to all men that come
					into existence? <milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and why merely by
					the operation of time, which he says is the cause of change in all things, do
					even things that did not begin to exist simultaneously change simultaneously?
					for instance, if a thing came into existence the day before the completion of
					the cycle, why does it yet change simultaneously with everything else? And in
					addition to these points, what is the reason why the republic changes from the
					constitution mentioned into the Spartan form<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Timocracy, <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 545a">Plat. Rep. 545a.</bibl></note>? For
					all constitutions more often change into the opposite form than into
						the<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>one near them. And the same
					remark applies to the other revolutions as well. For from the Spartan
					constitution the state changes, he says, to oligarchy, and from this to
					democracy, and from democracy to tyranny. Yet revolutions also occur the other
					way about, for example from democracy to oligarchy, and more often so than from
					democracy to monarchy. <milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again as to
					tyranny he does not say whether it will undergo revolution or not, nor, if it
					will, what will be the cause of it, and into what sort of constitution it will
					change; and the reason for this is that he would not have found it easy to say,
					for it is irregular; since according to him tyranny ought to change into the
					first and best constitution, for so the process would be continuous and a
					circle, but as a matter of fact tyranny also changes into tyranny, as the
					constitution of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1315b 13 n.</note> passed from the tyranny
					of Myron to that of Cleisthenes, and into oligarchy, as did that of
						Antileon<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Unknown, cf. 1304a 29 n.</note>
					at <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, and into democracy, as
					that of the family of Gelo<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1302b 33
						n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and
					into aristocracy, as that of Charilaus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See
						1271b 26 n.</note> at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>
					&lsqb;and as at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>&rsqb;.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This
						clause seems an interpolation; cf. b 6.</note>
					<milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And constitutions change from
					oligarchy to tyranny, as did almost the greatest number of the ancient
					oligarchies in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, at Leontini to
					the tyranny of Panaetius,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1310b 29

						related to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> as Dover is to
						France.</note> and in many other cities similarly. And it is also a strange
					idea that revolutions into oligarchy take place because the occupants of the
					offices are lovers of money and engaged in money-making, <milestone n="1316b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but not because
					owners of much more than the average amount of property think it unjust for
					those who do not own any property to have an equal share in the state with those
					who do; and in many oligarchies those in office are not allowed to engage in
					business, but there are laws preventing it, whereas in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, which has a democratic
						government,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently this clause also
						is an interpolation, or &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; is a copyist's
						mistake for &lsquo;oligarchic&rsquo; or
						&lsquo;timocratic,&rsquo; see 1272b 24 ff.</note> the magistrates go
					in for business, and they have not yet had a revolution. <milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is also a strange remark<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 551d">Plat. Rep. 551d</bibl>
					</note> that the oligarchical state is two states, one of rich men and one of
					poor men. For what has happened to this state rather than to the Spartan or any
					other sort of state where all do not own an equal amount of wealth or where all
					are not equally good men? and when nobody has become poorer than he was before,
					none the less revolution takes place from oligarchy to democracy if the men of
					no property become more numerous, and from democracy to oligarchy if the wealthy
					class is stronger than the multitude and the latter neglect politics but the
					former give their mind to them. And although there are many causes through which
					revolutions in oligarchies occur, he mentions only one&mdash;that of men
					becoming poor through riotous living, by paying away their money in interest on
					loans&mdash;as if at the start all men or most men were rich. <milestone n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But this is not true, but although when
					some of the leaders have lost their properties they stir up innovations, when
					men of the other classes are ruined nothing strange happens;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and even when such a revolution does occur it is no
					more likely to end in a democracy than in another form of constitution. And
					furthermore men also form factions and cause revolutions in the constitution if
					they are not allowed a share of honors, and if they are unjustly or insolently
					treated, even if they have not run through all their property . . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some words appear to be lost here; what
						follows refers to democracy, cf. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 587b">Plat. Rep.
							587b</bibl>.</note> because of being allowed to do whatever they like;
					the cause of which he states to be excessive liberty. And although there are
					several forms of oligarchy and of democracy, Socrates speaks of the revolutions
					that occur in them as though there were only one form of each.</p>

					<milestone n="1317a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for these modes when coupled together make the constitutions overlap, so as to

					suited to what kind of state, and similarly which of the kinds of oligarchy is
					suited to what kind of populace, and also which of the remaining constitutions
					is advantageous for which people; but nevertheless since it must not only be
					made clear which variety of these constitutions is best for states, but also how
					both these best varieties and the other forms must be established, let us
					briefly pursue the subject. And first let us speak about democracy; for at the
					same time the facts will also become clear about the opposite form of
					constitution, that is, the constitution which some people call oligarchy.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Rule of the few,&rsquo; i.e.
						the few rich, but the name is not exact, for in aristocracy also the rulers
						are few.</note>
					<milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And
					for this inquiry we must take into view all the features that are popular and
					that are thought<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to go with
					democracies; for it comes about from combinations of these that the kinds of
					democracy are formed, and that there are different democracies and more than one
					sort. In fact there are two causes for there being several kinds of democracy,
					first the one stated before, the fact that the populations are different
					&lpar;for we find one multitude engaged in agriculture and another
					consisting of handicraftsmen and day-laborers, and when the first of these is
					added to the second and again the third to both of them it not only makes a
					difference in that the quality of the democracy becomes better or worse but also
					by its becoming different in kind&rpar;; and the second cause is the one
					about which we now speak. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the
					institutions that go with democracies and seem to be appropriate to this form of
					constitution make the democracies different by their combinations; for one form
					of democracy will be accompanied by fewer, another by more, and another by all
					of them. And it is serviceable to ascertain each of them both for the purpose of
					instituting whichever of these kinds of democracy one happens to wish and for
					the purpose of amending existing ones. For people setting up constitutions seek
					to collect together all the features appropriate to their fundamental principle,
					but in so doing they make a mistake, as has been said before in the passage
					dealing with the causes of the destruction and the preservation of
					constitutions. And now let us state the postulates, the ethical characters and
					the aims of the various forms of democracy.<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now a fundamental principle
					of the democratic form of constitution is liberty&mdash;that is what is
					usually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate
					in liberty, <milestone n="1317b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one
					factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular
					principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if
					this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be
					sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute
					justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so
					that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich,
					because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is
					sovereign. <milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This then is one mark of
					liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one
					is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of
					liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a
					slave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim
					not to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be
					governed in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes
					to equalitarian liberty.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This clause is
						obscure: perhaps it is an interpolation.</note>
					<milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And these principles having been
					laid down and this being the nature of democratic government, the following
					institutions are democratic in character: election of officials by all from all;
					government of each by all,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and of all
					by each in turn; election by lot either to all magistracies or to all that do
					not need experience and skill; no property-qualification for office, or only a
					very low one; no office to be held twice, or more than a few times, by the same
					person, or few offices except the military ones; short tenure either of all
					offices or of as many as possible; judicial functions to be exercised by all
					citizens, that is by persons selected from all, and on all matters, or on most
					and the greatest and most important, for instance the audit of official
					accounts, constitutional questions, private contracts; the assembly to be
					sovereign over all matters, but no official over any or only over extremely few;
					or else a council to be sovereign over the most important matters <milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;and a council is the most
					democratic of magistracies in states where there is not a plentiful supply of
					pay for everybody&mdash;for where there is, they deprive even this office of
					its power, since the people draws all the trials to itself when it has plenty of
					pay, as has been said before in the treatise preceding this one<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 4, 1299b 38 ff. &lpar;Books 4. and 5.
						are regarded as forming one treatise&rpar;.</note>&rpar;; also
					payment for public duties, preferably in all branches, assembly, law-courts,
					magistracies, or if not, for the magistracies, the law-courts, council and
					sovereign assemblies, or for those magistracies which are bound<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. owing to the nature of their duties, and
						by general custom.</note> to have common mess tables. Also inasmuch as
					oligarchy is defined by birth, wealth and education, the popular qualifications
					are thought to be the opposite of these, low birth, poverty, vulgarity. And in
					respect of the magistracies it is democratic to have none tenable for life,

						questioned.</note> then are the features common to democracies. But what is
					thought to be the extreme form of democracy and of popular government comes
					about as a result of the principle of justice that is admitted to be democratic,
					and this is for all to have equality according to number. For it is equality for
					the poor to have no larger share of power than the rich, and not for the poor
					alone to be supreme but for all to govern equally; for in this way they would
					feel that the constitution possessed both equality and liberty. <milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the question follows, how will they
					have equality? are the property-assessments of five hundred citizens to be
					divided among a thousand and the thousand to have equal power to the five
						hundred<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. two groups of voters, with
						equal total wealth and total voting-power, but one group twice as numerous
						as the other, so that a man in the rich group has two votes and one in the
						poor group one, the former being on the average twice as rich as the
						latter.</note>? or is equality on this principle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. &lsquo;equality in proportion to
						number.&rsquo;</note> not to be arranged in this manner, but the
					division into classes to be on this system, but then an equal number to be taken
					from the five hundred and from the thousand and these to control the elections
					and the law-courts? Is this then the justest form of constitution in accordance
					with popular justice, or is it rather one that goes by counting heads?<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. &lsquo;one man one
						vote.&rsquo;</note> For democrats say that justice is whatever seems
					good to the larger number,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but
					advocates of oligarchy think that it is whatever seems good to the owners of the
					larger amount of property, for they say that the decision ought to go by amount
					of property. <milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But both views involve
					inequality and injustice; for if the will of the few is to prevail, this means a
					tyranny, since if one man owns more than the other rich men,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. apparently, more than the property of all the others put
						together.</note> according to the oligarchic principle of justice it is just
					for him to rule alone; whereas if the will of the numerical majority is to
					prevail, they will do injustice by confiscating the property of the rich
					minority, as has been said before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1281a
						14.</note> What form of equality therefore would be one on which both
					parties will agree must be considered in the light of the principles of justice
					as defined by both sets. For they say that whatever seems good to the majority
					of the citizens ought to be sovereign. <milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let us then accept this principle, yet not wholly without
					qualification, but inasmuch as fortune has brought into existence two component
					parts of the state, rich and poor, let any resolution passed by both classes, or
					by a majority of each, be sovereign, but if the two classes carry opposite
					resolutions, let the decision of the majority, in the sense of the group whose
					total property assessment is the larger, prevail: for instance, if there are ten
					rich citizens and twenty poor ones, and opposite votes have been cast by six of
					the rich on one side and by fifteen of the less wealthy on the other, four of
					the rich have sided with the poor and five of the poor with the rich; then the
					side that has the larger total property when the assessments of both classes on
					either side are added together carries the voting.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">If the rich citizens are on the average twice as wealthy as
						the poor &lpar;1.11&rpar;, and therefore a rich man has two votes to
						a poor man's one, when 6 rich and 5 poor vote one way, and 15 poor and 4
						rich the other, the division is 17 to 23, and the view of the latter party,
						which is carried, represents a larger total of wealth but a larger
						proportion of poor men.</note>
					<milestone n="1.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if the totals fall out exactly
					equal, this is to be deemed an impasse common to both sides, as it is at present
					if the assembly or law-court is exactly divided; <milestone n="1318b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>either a decision
					must be made by casting lots or some other such device must be adopted. But on
					questions of equality and justice, even though it is very difficult to discover
					the truth about them, nevertheless it is easier to hit upon it than to persuade
					people that have the power to get an advantage to agree to it; equality and
					justice are always sought by the weaker party, but those that have the upper
					hand pay no attention to them.<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There being four kinds of democracy, the
					best is the one that stands first in structure, as was said in the discourses
					preceding these<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 4, 1291b 30-41, 1292b
						25-33.</note>; it is also the oldest of them all, but by first I mean first
					as it were in a classification of the kinds of common people. The best common
					people are the agricultural population, so that it is possible to introduce
					democracy as well as other forms of constitution where the multitude lives by
					agriculture or by pasturing cattle. For owing to their not having much property
					they are busy, so that they cannot often meet in the assembly, while owing to
					their having<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MSS. give &lsquo;not
						having,&rsquo; but editors do not explain how in that case people would
						avoid starvation.</note> the necessaries of life they pass their time
					attending to their farm work and do not covet their neighbors' goods, but find
					more pleasure in working than in taking part in politics and holding office,
					where the profits to be made from the offices are not large; for the mass of
					mankind are more covetous of gain than of honor. <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And this is indicated by the fact that men endured the
					tyrannies of former times, and endure oligarchies, if a ruler does not prevent
					them from working or<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>rob them; for
					then some of them soon get rich and the others free from want. And also, if they
					have any ambition, to have control over electing magistrates and calling them to
					account makes up for the lack of office, since in some democracies even if the
					people have no part in electing the magistrates but these are elected by a
					special committee selected in turn out of the whole number, as at <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, yet if they have the power of
					deliberating on policy, the multitude are satisfied. &lpar;And this too must
					be counted as one form of democracy, on the lines on which it once existed at
						<placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>.&rpar; <milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed it is for this reason that it is
					advantageous for the form of democracy spoken of before, and is a customary
					institution in it, for all the citizens to elect the magistrates and call them
					to account, and to try law-suits, but for the holders of the greatest
					magistracies to be elected and to have property-qualifications, the higher
					offices being elected from the higher property-grades, or else for no office to
					be elected on a property-qualification, but for officials to be chosen on the
					ground of capacity. And a state governed in this way is bound to be governed
					well &lpar;for the offices will always be administered by the best men with
					the consent of the people and without their being jealous of the upper
					classes&rpar;, and this arrangement is certain to be satisfactory for the
					upper classes and notables, for they will not be under the government of others
					inferior to themselves, and they will govern justly because a different class
					will be in control of the audits&mdash;<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>since it is expedient to be in a state of suspense and not
					to be able to do everything exactly as seems good to one, for liberty to do
					whatever one likes cannot guard against the evil that is in every man's
					character. <milestone n="1319a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence there necessarily results the condition of affairs that
					is the most advantageous in the government of states&mdash;for the upper
					classes to govern without doing wrong, the common people not being deprived of
					any rights. It is manifest therefore that this is the best of the forms of
					democracy, and why this is so&mdash;namely, because in it the common people
					are of a certain kind.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For the purpose of making the people an agricultural
					community, not only were some of the laws that were enacted in many states in
					early times entirely serviceable, prohibiting the ownership of more than a
					certain amount of land under any conditions or else of more than a certain
					amount lying between a certain place and the citadel or city &lpar;and in
					early times at all events in many states there was even legislation prohibiting
					the sale of the original allotments; and there is a law said to be due to
						Oxylus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Leader of the Heraclidae in their
						invasion of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and
						afterwards king of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>.</note>
					with some similar provision, forbidding loans secured on a certain portion of a
					man's existing estate&rpar;, <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but
					at the present day it would also be well to introduce reform by means of the law
					of the Aphytaeans, as it is serviceable for the purpose of which we are
					speaking; the citizens of Aphytis<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aphytis was
						on the Isthmus of <placeName key="perseus,Pallene">Pallene</placeName> in
							<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</note> although
					numerous and possessing a small territory nevertheless are all engaged in
					agriculture, for they are assessed not on the whole of their estates, but on
					divisions of them so small that even the poor can exceed the required minimum in
					their assessments.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">No satisfactory
						explanation seems to have been suggested of what this means.</note>
					<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>After
					the agricultural community<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the best
					kind of democracy is where the people are herdsmen and get their living from
					cattle; for this life has many points of resemblance to agriculture, and as
					regards military duties pastoral people are in a very well trained condition and
					serviceable in body and capable of living in the open. But almost all the other
					classes of populace, of which the remaining kinds of democracy are composed, are
					very inferior to these, for their mode of life is mean, and there is no element
					of virtue in any of the occupations in which the multitude of artisans and
					market-people and the wage-earning class take part, and also owing to their
					loitering about the market-place and the city almost all people of this class
					find it easy to attend the assembly; whereas the farmers owing to their being
					scattered over the country do not attend, and have not an equal desire for this
					opportunity of meeting. <milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And where it
					also happens that the lie of the land is such that the country is widely
					separated from the city, it is easy to establish a good democracy and also a
					good constitutional government, for the multitude is forced to live at a
					distance on the farms; and so, even if there is a crowd that frequents the
					market-place, it is best in democracies not to hold assemblies without the
					multitude scattered over the country.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in
						a largely agricultural democracy, even though there may be a considerable
						idle population, which would attend frequent assemblies, it is best to hold
						them infrequently, so as to secure the attendance of the farmers.</note>
					<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It has then been stated how the best and first
					kind of democracy is to be organized, and it is clear how we ought to organize
					the other kinds also. For they must diverge in a corresponding order, and at
					each stage we must admit the next inferior class. <milestone n="1319b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The last kind of democracy, because all the
					population share in the government, it is not within the power of every state to
					endure, and it is not easy for it to persist if it is not well constituted in
					its laws and customs &lpar;but the things that result in destroying both
					this state and the other forms of constitution have been nearly all of them
					spoken of before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In Book 5.</note>&rpar;.
					With a view to setting up this kind of democracy and making the people powerful
					their leaders usually acquire as many supporters as possible and admit to
					citizenship not only the legitimate children of citizens but also the base-born
					and those of citizen-birth on one side, I mean those whose father or mother is a
					citizen; for all this element is specially congenial to a to democracy of this
					sort. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Popular leaders therefore
					regularly introduce such institutions; they ought however only to go on adding
					citizens up to the point where the multitude outnumbers the notables and the
					middle class and not to go beyond that point; for if they exceed it they make
					the government more disorderly, and also provoke the notables further in the
					direction of being reluctant to endure the democracy, which actually took place
					and caused the revolution at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In N. Africa.

					overlooked, but when it grows numerous it is more in evidence.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A
					democracy of this kind will also find useful such institutions as were employed
					by Cleisthenes<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1275b 36 n.</note> at
						<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> when he wished to
					increase the power of the democracy, and by the party setting up the democracy

					private religious rites must be grouped together into a small number of public
					celebrations, and every device must be employed to make all the people as much
					as possible intermingled with one another, and to break up the previously
					existing groups of associates. <milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover the characteristics of a tyranny also are all thought to be
					democratic, I mean for instance licence among slaves, which may really be
					advantageous for the popular party up to a point, and among women and children,
					and indulgence to live as one likes; a constitution of this sort will have a
					large number of supporters, as disorderly living is pleasanter to the mass of
					mankind than sober living.<milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But it is not the greatest or only task of the
					legislator or of those who desire to construct a constitution of this kind
					merely to set it up, but rather to ensure its preservation; for it is not
					difficult for any form of constitution to last for one or two or three days. We
					must therefore employ the results obtained in the inquiries that we have made
						already<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 5.</note> into the causes of
					the preservation and the destruction of constitutions, and attempt in the light
					of those results to establish the safety of the state, carefully avoiding the
					things that cause destruction, and enacting such laws both written and unwritten
						<milestone n="1320a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as shall best compass the results preservative of
					constitutions, and not think that a measure is democratic or oligarchic which
					will cause the state to be democratically or oligarchically governed in the
					greatest degree, but which will cause it to be so governed for the longest time.
						<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the demagogues of today to
					court the favor of the peoples often use the law-courts to bring about
					confiscations of property. Hence those who are caring for the safety of the
					constitution must counteract this by enacting that nothing belonging to persons
					condemned at law shall be confiscated and liable to be carried to the public
					treasury, but that their property shall be consecrated to the service of
					religion; for male-factors will be no less on their guard, as they will be
					punished just the same, while the mob will less often vote guilty against men on
					trial when it is not going to get anything out of it. Also they must always make
					the public trials that occur as few as possible, checking those who bring
					indictments at random by big penalties; for they do not usually indict men of
					the people but notables, whereas even with this form of constitution it is
					desirable for all the citizens if possible to be friendly to the state, or
					failing that, at all events not to think of their rulers as enemies. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And inasmuch as the ultimate forms of
					democracy tend to have large populations and it is difficult for their citizens
					to sit in the assembly without pay, and this in a state where there do not
					happen to be revenues is inimical to the notables <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&lpar;for pay has to be obtained from a property-tax and
					confiscation, and from corruption of the law-courts, which has caused the
					overthrow of many democracies before now&rpar;,&mdash;where therefore
					there happen to be no revenues, few meetings of the assembly must be held, and
					the law-courts must consist of many members but only sit a few days
					&lpar;for this not only contributes to the rich not being in fear of the
					cost of the system even if the well-off do not take the pay and only the poor
					do, but also leads to far greater efficiency in the trial of law-suits, for the
					well-to-do, though not wishing to be away from their private affairs for many
					days, are willing to leave them for a short time&rpar;, <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>while where there are revenues men must not do what
					the popular leaders do now &lpar;for they use the surplus for doles, and
					people no sooner get them than they want the same doles again, because this way
					of helping the poor is the legendary jar with a hole in it<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The fifty daughters of Danaus were married to their cousins,
						and all but one murdered their husbands on the bridal night, and were
						punished in Hades by having to pour water into the jar
					described.</note>&rpar;, but the truly democratic statesman must study how
					the multitude may be saved from extreme poverty; for this is what causes
					democracy to be corrupt. Measures must therefore be contrived that may bring
					about lasting prosperity. And since this is advantageous also for the
					well-to-do, the proper course is to collect all the proceeds of the revenues
					into a fund and distribute this in lump sums to the needy, best of all, if one
					can, in sums large enough for acquiring a small estate, or, failing this, to
					serve as capital for trade or husbandry, <milestone n="1320b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and if this is not possible for
					all, at all events to distribute the money by tribes or some other division of
					the population in turn, while in the meantime the well-to-do must contribute pay
					for attendance at the necessary assemblies, being themselves excused from
					useless public services. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By
					following some such policy as this the Carthaginians have won the friendship of
					the common people; for they constantly send out some of the people to the
					surrounding territories and so make them well-off. And if the notables are men
					of good feeling and sense they may also divide the needy among them in groups
					and supply them with capital to start them in businesses. It is also a good plan
					to imitate the policy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1263a 35.</note> of
					the Tarentines. They get the goodwill of the multitude by making property
					communal for the purpose of use by the needy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems to mean that the land was in private ownership, but that there
						was some system of poor-relief, to provide for the destitute out of the
						produce.</note>; also they have divided the whole number of their
					magistracies into two classes, one elected by vote and the other filled by
					lot,&mdash;the latter to ensure that the people may have a share in them,
					and the former to improve the conduct of public affairs. And it is also possible
					to effect this by dividing the holders of the same magistracy into two groups,
					one appointed by lot and the other by vote.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We
					have then said how democracies should be organized.<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is also fairly clear
					from these considerations how oligarchies ought to be organized. We must infer
					them from their opposites, reasoning out each form of oligarchy<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>with reference to the form of democracy opposite to
					it, starting with the most well-blended and first form of oligarchy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In contrast with the first and best form of
						democracy, 2 init.</note>&mdash;and this is the one near to what is
					called a constitutional government, and for it the property-qualifications must
					be divided into one group of smaller properties and another of larger ones,
					smaller properties qualifying their owners for the indispensable offices and
					larger ones for the more important; and a person owning the qualifying property
					must be allowed to take a share in the government,&mdash;introducing by the
					assessment a large enough number of the common people to secure that with them
					the governing class will have a majority over those excluded; and persons to
					share in the government must constantly be brought in from the better class of
					the common people. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the next form
					of oligarchy also must be constructed in a similar way with a slight tightening
					up of the qualification. But the form of oligarchy that stands opposite to the
					last form of democracy, the most autocratic and tyrannical of the oligarchies,
					in as far as it is the worst requires a correspondingly great amount of
					safe-guarding. For just as human bodies in a good state of health and ships well
					equipped with their crews for a voyage admit of more mistakes without being
					destroyed thereby, but bodies of a morbid habit and vessels strained in their
					timbers and manned with bad crews cannot endure even the smallest mistakes, so
					also the worst constitutions need the most safe-guarding. <milestone n="1321a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Democracies therefore generally speaking are kept
					safe by the largeness of the citizen-body, for this is the antithesis of justice
					according to desert; but oligarchy on the contrary must manifestly obtain its
					security by means of good organization.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since
					the mass of the population falls principally into four divisions, the farming
					class, artisans, retail traders and hired laborers, and military forces are of
					four classes, cavalry, heavy infantry, light infantry and marines, in places
					where the country happens to be suitable for horsemanship, there natural
					conditions favor the establishment of an oligarchy that will be powerful
					&lpar;for the security of the inhabitants depends on the strength of this
					element, and keeping studs of horses is the pursuit of those who own extensive
					estates&rpar;; and where the ground is suitable for heavy infantry,
					conditions favor the next form of oligarchy &lpar;for heavy infantry is a
					service for the well-to-do rather than the poor&rpar;; but light infantry
					and naval forces are an entirely democratic element. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As things are therefore, where there is a large multitude
					of this class, when party strife occurs the oligarchs often get the worst of the
					struggle; and a remedy for this must be adopted from military commanders, who
					combine with their cavalry and heavy infantry forces a contingent of light
					infantry. And this is the way<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. by
						superior mobility.</note> in which the common people get the better over the
					well-to-do in outbreaks of party strife:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>being unencumbered they fight easily against cavalry and heavy
					infantry. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore to establish
					this force out of this class is to establish it against itself, but the right
					plan is for the men of military age to be separated into a division of older and
					one of younger men, and to have their own sons while still young trained in the
					exercises of light and unarmed troops, and for youths selected from among the
					boys to be themselves trained in active operations. And the bestowal of a share
					in the government upon the multitude should either go on the lines stated
						before,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">4.1, 1320b 25 ff.</note> and be
					made to those who acquire the property-qualification, or as at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, to people after they have abstained
					for a time from mechanic industries, or as at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, by making a selection among members of the
					governing classes and those outside it of persons who deserve<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">If the text is corrected it seems to mean that
						the list was revised from time to time and some old names taken off and new
						ones put on.</note> inclusion. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And furthermore the most supreme offices also, which must be retained by those
					within the constitution, must have expensive duties attached to them, in order
					that the common people may be willing to be excluded from them, and may feel no
					resentment against the ruling class, because it pays a high price for office.
					And it fits in with this that they should offer splendid sacrifices and build up
					some public monument on entering upon office, so that the common people sharing
					in the festivities and seeing the city decorated both with votive offerings and
					with building may be glad to see the constitution enduring; and an additional
					result will be that the notables will have memorials of their outlay. But at
					present the members of oligarchies do not adopt this course but the opposite,
					for they seek the gains of office just as much as the honor; hence these
					oligarchies are well described as miniature democracies.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The phrase suggests that in democracy public duties are
						cheifly undertaken for their emoluments.</note>
					<milestone n="1321b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Let this then be a description of the proper way to organize the various forms
					of democracy and of oligarchy.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As a consequence of what has been said
					there follow satisfactory conclusions to the questions concerning
					magistracies&mdash;how many and what they should be and to whom they should
					belong, as has also been said before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 4
						,1297b 35 ff., 1299a 3 ff.</note> For without the indispensable<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 4.1.</note> magistracies a state cannot
					exist, while without those that contribute to good order and seemliness it
					cannot be well governed. And furthermore the magistracies are bound to be fewer
					in the small states and more numerous in the large ones, as in fact has been
					said before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 4, 1299b 30 ff.</note>; it
					must therefore be kept in view what kinds of magistracies it is desirable to
					combine and what kinds to keep separate. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>First among the indispensable services is the
					superintendence of the market, over which there must be an official to
					superintend contracts and good order; since it is a necessity for almost all
					states that people shall sell some things and buy others according to one
					another's necessary requirements, and this is the readiest means of securing
					self-sufficiency, which seems to be the reason for men's having united into a
					single state. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Another
					superintendency connected very closely with this one is the curatorship of
					public and private properties in the city,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to secure good order and the preservation and rectification of
					falling buildings and roads, and of the bounds between different persons'
					estates, so that disputes may not arise about them, and all the other duties of
					superintendence similar to these. An office of this nature is in most states
					entitled that of City-controller, but it has several departments, each of which
					is filled by separate officials in the states with larger populations, for
					instance Curators of Walls, Superintendents of Wells, Harbors-guardians.
						<milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And another office also is
					indispensable and closely akin to these, for it controls the same matters but
					deals with the country and there regions outside the city; and these magistrates
					are called in some places Land-controllers and in others Custodians of Forests.
					These then are three departments of control over these matters, while another
					office is that to which the revenues of the public funds are paid in, the
					officials who guard them and by whom they are divided out to the several
					administrative departments; these magistrates are called Receivers and Stewards.
					Another magistracy is the one that has to receive a written return of private
					contracts and of the verdicts of the law-courts; and with these same officials
					the registration of legal proceedings and their institution have also to take
					place. In some states this office also is divided into several, but there are
					places where one magistracy controls all these matters; and these officials are
					called Sacred Recorders, Superintendents, Recorders, and other names akin to
					these. <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And after these is the office
					connected with it but perhaps the most indispensable and most difficult of all,
					the one concerned with the execution of judgement upon persons cast in suits and
					those posted as defaulters according to the lists, <milestone n="1322a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and with the
					custody of prisoners. This is an irksome office because it involves great
					unpopularity, so that where it is not possible to make a great deal of profit
					out of it men will not undertake it, or when they have undertaken it are
					reluctant to carry out its functions according to the laws; but it is necessary,
					because there is no use in trials being held about men's rights when the
					verdicts are not put into execution, so that if when no legal trial of disputes
					takes place social intercourse is impossible, so also is it when judgements are
					not executed. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it is better for
					this magistracy not to be a single office but to consist of several persons
					drawn from different courts, and it is desirable similarly to try to divide up
					the functions connected with the posting up of people registered as public
					debtors, and further also in some cases for the sentences to be executed by
					magistrates, especially by the newly elected ones preferably in suits tried by
					the outgoing ones, and in those tried by men actually in office for the
					magistrate executing the sentence to be different from the one that passed it,
					for instance the City-controllers to execute the judgements passed on from the
					Market-controllers and other magistrates those passed on by the
					City-controllers. For the less odium involved for those who execute the
					judgements, the more adequately the judgements will be carried out; so for the
					same magistrates to have imposed the sentence and to execute it involves a
					twofold odium, and for the same ones to execute it in all cases makes them the
					enemies of everybody. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in many
					places also the office of keeping custody of prisoners, for example at
						<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the office of the
					magistrates known as the Eleven<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This example
						looks like a mistaken note interpolated in the text. The Eleven had both
						functions.</note>,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is separate
					from the magistracy that executes sentences. It is better therefore to keep this
					also separate, and to attempt the same device with regard to this as well. For
					though it is no less necessary than the office of which I spoke, yet in practice
					respectable people avoid it most of all offices, while it is not safe to put it
					into the hands of the base, for they themselves need others to guard them
					instead of being able to keep guard over others. Hence there must not be one
					magistracy specially assigned to the custody of prisoners nor must the same
					magistracy perform this duty continuously, but it should be performed by the
					young, in places where there is a regiment of cadets<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and
						elsewhere young citizens from eighteen to twenty were enrolled in training
						corps for military instruction; these served as police and home
						troops.</note> or guards, and by the magistrates, in successive
						sections.<milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These magistracies therefore must be counted first as supremely
					necessary, and next to them must be put those that are not less necessary but
					are ranked on a higher grade of dignity, because they require much experience
					and trustworthiness; in this class would come the magistracies concerned with
					guarding the city and those assigned to military requirements. And both in peace
					and in war it is equally necessary for there to be magistrates to superintend
					the guarding of gates and walls and the inspection and drill of the citizen
					troops. <milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In some places therefore
					there are more magistracies assigned to all these duties, and in others
					fewer&mdash;for instance in the small states there is one to deal with all
					of them. And the officers of this sort are entitled Generals or War-lords.
						<milestone n="1322b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And moreover if there are also cavalry or light infantry or
					archers or a navy, sometimes a magistracy is appointed to have charge of each of
					these arms also, and they carry the titles of Admiral, Cavalry-commander and
					Taxiarch, and also the divisional commissions subordinate to these of Captains
					of Triremes, Company-commanders and Captains of Tribes, and all the subdivisions
					of these commands. But the whole of this sort of officers constituted a single
					class, that of military command. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This then is how the matter stands in regard to this office; but inasmuch as
					some of the magistracies, if not all, handle large sums of public money, there
					must be another office to receive an account and subject it to audit, which must
					itself handle no other business; and these officials are called Auditors by some
					people, Accountants by others, Examiners by others and Advocates by others. And
					by the side of all these offices is the one that is most supreme over all
					matters, for often the same magistracy has the execution of business that
					controls its introduction, or presides over the general assembly in places where
					the people are supreme; for the magistracy that convenes the sovereign assembly
					is bound to be the sovereign power in the state. It is styled in some places the
					Preliminary Council because it considers business in advance, but where there is
					a democracy<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1323a 9 below. Apparently
							<foreign lang="greek">plh=qo/s e)sti</foreign> stands for <foreign lang="greek">to\ plh=qos ku/rio/n e)sti</foreign>, but editors quote no
						parallel.</note> it is more usually called a Council. This more or less
					completes the number of the offices of a political nature; <milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but another kind of superintendence is that
					concerned with divine worship; in this class are priests and superintendents of
						matters<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>connected with the
					temples, the preservation of existing buildings and the restoration of those
					that are ruinous, and the other duties relating to the gods. In practice this
					superintendence in some places forms a single office, for instance in the small
					cities, but in others it belongs to a number of officials who are not members of
					the priesthood, for example Sacrificial Officers and Temple-guardians and
					Stewards of Sacred Funds. And connected with this is the office devoted to the
					management of all the public festivals which the law does not assign to the
					priests but the officials in charge of which derive their honor from the common
					sacrificial hearth, and these officials are called in some places Archons, in
					others Kings and in others Presidents. <milestone n="5.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To sum up therefore, the necessary offices of
					superintendence deal with the following matters : institutions of religion,
					military institutions, revenue and expenditure, control of the market, citadel,
					harbors and country, also the arrangements of the law-courts, registration of
					contracts, collection of fines, custody of prisoners, supervision of accounts
					and inspections, and the auditing of officials, and lastly the offices connected
					with the body that deliberates about public affairs. <milestone n="5.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand, peculiar to the states that have more
					leisure and prosperity, and also pay attention to public decorum, are the
					offices of Superintendent of Women, Guardian of the Laws, Superintendent of
					Children, Controller of Physical Training, <milestone n="1323a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in addition to these the
					superintendence of athletic and Dionysiac contests and of any similar displays
					that happen to be held. Some of these offices are obviously not of a popular
					character, for instance that of Superintendent of Women and of Children; for the
					poor having no slaves are forced to employ their women and children as servants.
					There are three offices which in some states supervise the election of the chief
					magistrates&mdash;Guardians of the Laws, Preliminary Councillors and
					Council; of these the Guardians of the Laws are an aristocratic institution, the
					Preliminary Councillors oligarchic, and a Council democratic.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have now therefore spoken in outline about almost all the

					student who is going to make a suitable investigation of the best form of
					constitution must necessarily decide first of all what is the most desirable
					mode of life. For while this is uncertain it is also bound to be uncertain what
					is the best constitution, since it is to be expected that the people that have
					the best form of government available under their given conditions will fare the
					best, exceptional circumstances apart. Hence we must first<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>agree what life is most desirable for almost all
					men, and after that whether the same life is most desirable both for the
					community and for the individual, or a different one. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Believing therefore in the adequacy of much of what is
					said even in extraneous discourses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 3.6.
						It is debated whether the phrase refers to Aristotle's own popular writings,
						or to those of other philosophers, or to discussions of the subject in
						ordinary intercourse.</note> on the subject of the best life, let us make
					use of these pronouncements now. For as regards at all events one classification
					of things good, putting them in three groups, external goods, goods of the soul
					and goods of the body, assuredly nobody would deny that the ideally happy are
					bound to possess all three. For nobody would call a man ideally happy that has
					not got a particle of courage nor of temperance nor of justice nor of wisdom,
					but is afraid of the flies that flutter by him, cannot refrain from any of the
					most outrageous actions in order to gratify a desire to eat or to drink, ruins
					his dearest friends for the sake of a farthing, and similarly in matters of the
					intellect also is as senseless and mistaken as any child or lunatic. <milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But although these are propositions which
					when uttered everybody would agree to, yet men differ about amount and degrees
					of value. They think it is enough to possess however small a quantity of virtue,
					but of wealth, riches, power, glory and everything of that kind they seek a
					larger and larger amount without limit. We on the other hand shall tell them
					that it is easy to arrive at conviction on these matters in the light of the
					actual facts, when one sees that men do not acquire and preserve the virtues by
					means of these external goods, but external goods by means of the virtues,
						<milestone n="1323b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that whether the life of happiness consists for man in
					enjoyment or in virtue or in both, it is found in larger measure with those who
					are of surpassingly high cultivation in character and intellect but only
					moderate as regards the external acquisition of goods, than with those who own
					more than they can use of the latter but are deficient in the former. <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Not but what the truth is also easily seen
					if we consider the matter in the light of reason. For external goods have a
					limit, as has any instrument &lpar;and everything useful is useful for
					something&rpar;, so an excessive amount of them must necessarily do harm, or
					do no good, to its possessor; whereas with any of the goods of the soul, the
					more abundant it is, the more useful it must be&mdash;if even to goods of
					the soul not only the term &lsquo;noble&rsquo; but also the term
					&lsquo;useful&rsquo; can be properly applied. And broadly, it is clear
					that we shall declare that the best condition of each particular thing,
					comparing things with one another, corresponds in point of superiority to the
					distance that subsists between the things of which we declare these conditions
					themselves to be conditions.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">e.g. the finest
						man excels the finest monkey to the degree in which the species man excels
						the species monkey.</note> Hence inasmuch as our soul is a more valuable
					thing both absolutely and relatively to ourselves than either our property or
					our body, the best conditions of these things must necessarily stand in the same
					relation to one another as the things themselves do. Moreover it is for the sake
					of the soul that these goods are in their nature desirable, and that all wise
					men must<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>choose them, not the soul for
					the sake of those other things. <milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let
					us then take it as agreed between us that to each man there falls just so large
					a measure of happiness as he achieves of virtue and wisdom and of virtuous and
					wise action: in evidence of this we have the case of God, who is happy and
					blessed, but is so on account of no external goods, but on account of himself,
					and by being of a certain quality in his nature; since it is also for this
					reason that prosperity is necessarily different from happiness&mdash;for the
					cause of goods external to the soul is the spontaneous and fortune,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Aristotle taught that some events are the
						result of the undesigned interaction of two lines of causation in nature's
						design; he denoted this &lpar;1&rpar; in general, by &lsquo;the
						automatic&rsquo; or self-acting &lpar;represented in Latin by
							<emph>sponte</emph>, spontaneous&rpar;, &lpar;2&rpar; as
						concerning man, by &lsquo;fortune.&rsquo;</note> but nobody is just
					or temperate as a result of or owing to the action of fortune. And connected is
					a truth requiring the same arguments to prove it, that it is also the best
					state, and the one that does well,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The common
						play on the ambiguity of &lsquo;do well,&rsquo; meaning either
						&lsquo;prosper&rsquo; or &lsquo;act rightly.&rsquo;</note>
					that is happy. But to do well is impossible save for those who do good actions,
					and there is no good action either of a man or of a state without virtue and
					wisdom; and courage, justice and wisdom belonging to a state have the same
					meaning and form as have those virtues whose possession bestows the titles of
					just and wise and temperate on an individual human being.<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These remarks
					however must suffice by way of preface to our discourse: for neither is it
					possible to abstain from touching on these subjects altogether, nor is it
					feasible to follow out all the arguments that are germane to them, for that is
					the business of another course of study. For the present let us take it as
					established that the best life, whether separately for an individual or
					collectively for states, <milestone n="1324a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is the life conjoined with virtue furnished with
					sufficient means for taking part in virtuous actions<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1099a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1099a
							32</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1179a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1179a 4
							ff.</bibl></note>; while objections to this position we must pass over
					in the course of the present inquiry, and reserve them for future consideration,
					if anyone be found to disagree with what has been said.<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>On the other hand it
					remains to say whether the happiness of a state is to be pronounced the same as
					that of each individual man, or whether it is different. Here too the answer is
					clear: everybody would agree that it is the same; for all those who base the
					good life upon wealth in the case of the individual, also assign felicity to the
					state as a whole if it is wealthy; and all who value the life of the tyrant
					highest, would also say that the state which rules the widest empire is the
					happiest; and if any body accepts the individual as happy on account of virtue,
					he will also say that the state which is the better morally is the happier.
						<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there now arise these two
					questions that require consideration: first, which mode of life is the more
					desirable, the life of active citizenship and participation in politics, or
					rather the life of an alien and that of detachment from the political
					partnership; next, what constitution and what organization of a state is to be
					deemed the best,&mdash;either on the assumption that to take an active part
					in the state is desirable for everybody, or that it is undesirable for some men
					although desirable for most. But as it is<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the latter question that is the business of political study and
					speculation, and not the question of what is desirable for the individual, and
					as it is the investigation of politics that we have now taken up, the former
					question would be a side issue, and the latter is the business of political
						inquiry.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it is clear that the best constitution is the system under
					which anybody whatsoever would be best off and would live in felicity; but the
					question is raised even on the part of those who agree that the life accompanied
					by virtue is the most desirable, whether the life of citizenship and activity is
					desirable or rather a life released from all external affairs, for example some
					form of contemplative life, which is said by some to be the only life that is
						philosophic.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek should be
						altered to give &lsquo;which alone is said to be desirable by some
						philosophers.&rsquo;</note> For it is manifest that these are the two
					modes of life principally chosen by the men most ambitious of excelling in
					virtue, both in past times and at the present day&mdash;I mean the life of
					politics and the life of philosophy. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it makes no little difference which way the truth lies; for assuredly the
					wise are bound to arrange their affairs in the direction of the better
					goal&mdash;and this applies to the state collectively as well as to the
					individual human being. Some persons think that empire over one's neighbors, if
					despotically exercised, involves a definite injustice of the greatest kind, and
					if constitutionally, although it carries no injustice, yet is a hindrance to the
					ruler's own well-being; but others hold almost the opposite view to
					these&mdash;they think that the life of action and citizenship is the only
					life fit for a man, since with each of the virtues its exercise in actions is
					just as possible for men engaged in public affairs and in politics as for those
					who live a private life. <milestone n="1324b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some
					people then hold the former view, while others declare that the despotic and
					tyrannical form of constitution alone achieves happiness; and in some states it
					is also the distinctive aim of the constitution and the laws to enable them to
					exercise despotic rule over their neighbors. Hence even though with most peoples
					most of the legal ordinances have been laid down virtually at random,
					nevertheless if there are places where the laws aim at one definite object, that
					object is in all cases power, as in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> both
					the system of education and the mass of the laws are framed in the main with a
					view to war; and also among all the non-Hellenic nations that are strong enough
					to expand at the expense of others, military strength has been held in honor,
					for example, among the Scythians, Persians, Thracians and Celts. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed among some peoples there are even
					certain laws stimulating military valor; for instance at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, we are told, warriors receive
					the decoration of armlets of the same number as the campaigns on which they have
					served; and at one time there was also a law in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> that a man who had never killed an enemy must wear
					his halter instead of a belt. Among Scythian tribes at a certain festival a cup
					was carried round from which a man that had not killed an enemy was not allowed
					to drink. Among the Iberians, a warlike race, they fix small spits<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps &lsquo;pointed
						stones.&rsquo;</note><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in the
					earth round a man's grave corresponding in number to the enemies he has killed.
					So with other races there are many other practices of a similar kind, some
					established by law and others by custom.<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nevertheless those who wish
					to examine the matter closely might perhaps think it exceedingly strange that it
					should be the business of a statesman to be able to devise means of holding
					empire and mastery over the neighboring peoples whether they desire it or not.
					How can that be worthy of a statesman or lawgiver which is not even lawful? and
					government is not lawful when it is carried on not only justly but also
					unjustly&mdash;and superior strength may be unjustly exercised. <milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover we do not see this in the other
					sciences either: it is no part of a physician's or ship-captain's business to
					use either persuasion or compulsion upon the patients in the one case and the
						crew<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps &lsquo;the
						passengers.&rsquo;</note> in the other. Yet most peoples seem to think
					that despotic rule is statesmanship, and are not ashamed to practise towards
					others treatment which they declare to be unjust and detrimental for themselves;
					for in their own internal affairs they demand just government, yet in their
					relations with other peoples they pay no attention to justice. <milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet it is strange if there is not a natural
					distinction between peoples suited to be despotically ruled and those not
					suited; so that if this is so, it is not proper to attempt to exercise despotic
					government over all people, but only over those suited for it, just as it is not
					right to hunt human beings for food or sacrifice, but only the game suitable for
					this purpose, that is, such wild creatures as are good to eat. And moreover it
					is possible even for a single state in isolation to be happy, <milestone n="1325a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that is
					one that is well governed, in as much as it is conceivable that a state might be
					carried on somewhere in isolation, enjoying good laws, and in such a state the
					system of the constitution will not be framed for the purpose of war or of
					overpowering its enemies&mdash;for we are to suppose everything to do with
					war to be excluded. <milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is evident
					therefore that while all military pursuits are to be deemed honorable, they are
					not so as being the ultimate end of all things but as means to that end. And it
					is the business of the good lawgiver to study how a state, a race of men or any
					other community is to partake of the good life and the happiness possible for
					them. Some however of the regulations laid down will vary; and in case there
					exist any neighbor peoples, it is the business of the legislative art to
					consider what sort of exercises should be practised in relation to what sort of
					neighbors or how the state is to adopt the regulations that are suitable in
					relation to each.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But this question of the proper
					end for the best constitutions to aim at may receive its due consideration
						later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 13, 14.</note>
					<milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We
					turn to those who, while agreeing that the life of virtue is the most desirable,
					differ about the way in which that life should be pursued. Some disapprove of
					holding office in the state, thinking that the life of the free man<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>is different from the life of politics and
					is the most desirable of any; whereas others think the political life the best
					life, for they argue that it is impossible for the man who does nothing to do
					well, and doing well and happiness are the same thing.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">On the ambiguous use of &lsquo;do well&rsquo; see
						1323b 32 n.</note> To these two parties we must reply that both are partly
					right and partly wrong. The former are right in saying that the life of the free
					man is better than the life of mastership, for this is true&mdash;there is
					nothing specially dignified in employing a slave, as a slave, for giving orders
					about menial duties has in it nothing of nobility; <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>yet to think that all government is exercising the
					authority of a master is a mistake, for there is as wide a difference between
					ruling free men and ruling slaves as there is between the natural freeman and
					the natural slave themselves. But these things have been adequately decided in
					the first discourses.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. Book 1.</note> But
					to praise inaction more highly than action is an error, for happiness is an
					activity, and further the actions of the just and temperate have in them the
					realization of much that is noble. <milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet on the strength of these decisions somebody might perhaps suppose that the
					highest good is to be the master of the world, since thus one would have the
					power to compass the greatest number and the noblest kind of actions, and
					therefore it is not the duty of the man that is capable of ruling to surrender
					office to his neighbor, but rather to take it from him, and no account must be
					taken by father of sons nor by sons of father nor in general by one friend of
					another, and no heed must be paid to them in comparison with this; for the best
					thing is the most to be desired, and to do well is the best thing. <milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now this statement is perhaps true
						<milestone n="1325b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>if it is the case that the most desirable of existing things
					will belong to men that use robbery and violence. But perhaps it cannot belong
					to them, and this is a false assumption. For a man's acts can no longer be noble
					if he does not excel as greatly as a man excels a woman or a father his children
					or a master his slaves, so that one who transgresses cannot afterwards achieve
					anything sufficient to rectify the lapse from virtue that he had already
					committed; because for equals the noble and just consists in their taking turns,
					since this is equal and alike, but for those that are equal to have an unequal
					share and those that are alike an unlike share is contrary to nature, and
					nothing contrary to nature is noble. Hence in case there is another person who
					is our superior in virtue and in practical capacity for the highest functions,
					him it is noble to follow and him it is just to obey; though he must possess not
					only virtue but also capacity that will render him capable of action. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if these things are well said, and if
					happiness is to be defined as well-doing, the active life is the best life both
					for the whole state collectively and for each man individually. But the active
					life is not necessarily active in relation to other men, as some people think,
					nor are only those processes of thought active that are pursued for the sake of
					the objects that result from action, but far more<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>those speculations and thoughts that have their end in
					themselves and are pursued for their own sake; for the end is to do well, and
					therefore is a certain form of action.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf.
						1323b 32 n., 1325a 21.</note> And even with actions done in relation to
					external objects we predicate action in the full sense chiefly of the
					master-craftsmen who direct the action by their thoughts. <milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover with cities also, those that occupy an
					isolated situation and pursue a policy of isolation are not necessarily
					inactive; for state activities also can be sectional, since the sections of the
					state have many common relations with one another. And this is also possible
					similarly in the case of any individual human being; for otherwise God and the
					whole universe could hardly be well circumstanced, since they have no external
					activities by the side of their own private activities.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is therefore manifest that the same life must be the best
					both for each human being individually and for states and mankind
						collectively.<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And as we have prepared the way by this prefatory discussion of
					the subject, and have previously studied all the other forms of
						constitution,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This seems to refer to
						Books 4-6.</note> the starting-point for the remainder of our subject is
					first to specify the nature of the conditions that are necessary in the case of
					the state that is to be constituted in the ideally best manner. For the best
					constitution cannot be realized without suitable equipment.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. 1288b 39 n.</note> We must therefore posit as granted in
					advance a number of as it were ideal conditions, although none of these must be
					actually impossible. I mean for instance in reference to number of citizens and
					territory. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All other craftsmen, for
					example a weaver or a shipwright, <milestone n="1326a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>have to be supplied with their
					material in a condition suitable for their trade, for the better this material
					has been prepared, the finer is bound to be the product of their craft; so also
					the statesman and the lawgiver ought to be furnished with their proper material
					in a suitable condition. Under the head of material equipment for the state
					there first come the questions as to a supply of population&mdash;what
					precisely ought to be its number and what its natural character? and similarly
					in regard to the territory, what is to be its particular size and nature?
						<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Most people imagine that the
					prosperous state must be a great state; but granted the truth of this, they fail
					to realize in what quality the greatness or smallness of a state consists: they
					judge a great state by the numerical magnitude of the population, but really the
					more proper thing to look at is not numbers but efficiency. For a state like
					other things has a certain function to perform, so that it is the state most
					capable of performing this function that is to be deemed the greatest, just as
					one would pronounce Hippocrates to be greater, not as a human being but as a
					physician, than somebody who surpassed him in bodily size. <milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All the same, even if it be right to judge the
					state by the test of its multitude, this ought not to be done with regard to the
					multitude of any and every class &lpar;for states are doubtless bound to
					contain a large number of slaves<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					resident aliens and foreigners&rpar;, but the test should be the number of
					those who are a part of the state&mdash;the special parts of which a state
					consists. It is superiority in the number of these that indicates a great state;
					a state that sends forth to war a large number of the baser sort and a small
					number of heavy-armed soldiers cannot possibly be a great state&mdash;for a
					great state is not the same thing as a state with a large population. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But certainly experience also shows that it
					is difficult and perhaps impossible for a state with too large a population to
					have good legal government. At all events we see that none of the states reputed
					to be well governed is without some restriction in regard to numbers. The
					evidence of theory proves the same point. Law is a form of order, and good law
					must necessarily mean good order; but an excessively large number cannot
					participate in order: to give it order would surely be a task for divine power,
					which holds even this universe together.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In
						the MSS. this clause follows the next.</note> Hence that state also must
					necessarily be the most beautiful with whose magnitude is combined the
					above-mentioned limiting principle; <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for certainly beauty is usually found in number and magnitude, but there is a
					due measure of magnitude for a city-state as there also is for all other
					things&mdash;animals, plants, tools; each of these if too small or
					excessively large will not possess its own proper efficiency, but in some cases
					will have entirely lost its true nature and in others will be in a defective
					condition: for instance, a ship a span long will not be a ship at all, nor will
					a ship a quarter of a mile long, and even when it reaches a certain size,
						<milestone n="1326b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in some cases smallness and in others excessive largeness will
					make it sail badly. <milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly a
					state consisting of too few people will not be self-sufficing &lpar;which is
					an essential quality of a state&rpar;, and one consisting of too many,
					though self-sufficing in the mere necessaries, will be so in the way in which a
						nation<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. presumably an Ethnos in the
						usual sense, a community composed of villages loosely bound together by
						relationship and trade, and united for defence, but not for political life;
						not an Ethnos of associated cities.</note> is, and not as a state, since it
					will not be easy for it to possess constitutional government&mdash;for who
					will command its over-swollen multitude in war? or who will serve as its herald,
					unless he have the lungs of a Stentor? It follows that the lowest limit for the
					existence of a state is when it consists of a population that reaches the
					minimum number that is self-sufficient for the purpose of living the good life
					after the manner of a political community. It is possible also for one that
					exceeds this one in number to be a greater state, but, as we said, this
					possibility of increase is not without limit, and what the limit of the state's
					expansion is can easily be seen from practical considerations. The activities of
					the state are those of the rulers and those of the persons ruled, and the work
					of a ruler is to direct the administration and to judge law-suits; but in order
					to decide questions of justice and in order to distribute the offices according
					to merit it is necessary for the citizens to know each other's personal
					characters, since where this does not happen to be the case the business of
					electing officials and trying law-suits is bound to go badly; haphazard decision
					is unjust in both matters, and this<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>must obviously prevail in an excessively numerous community. <milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also in such a community it is easy for
					foreigners and resident aliens to usurp the rights of citizenship, for the
					excessive number of the population makes it not difficult to escape detection.
					It is clear therefore that the best limiting principle for a state is the
					largest expansion of the population, with a view to self-sufficiency that can
					well be taken in at one view.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such may be our
					conclusion on the question of the size of the state.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Very much the same holds
					good about its territory. As to the question what particular kind of land it
					ought to have, it is clear that everybody would command that which is most
					self-sufficing &lpar;and such is necessarily that which bears every sort of
					produce, for self-sufficiency means having a supply of everything and lacking
					nothing&rpar;. In extent and magnitude the land ought to be of a size that
					will enable the inhabitants to live a life of liberal and at the same time
					temperate leisure. Whether this limiting principle is rightly or wrongly stated
					must be considered more precisely later on,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled in the work as it has come down to us.</note>
					when we come to raise the general subject of property and the ownership of
					wealth,&mdash;how and in what way it ought to be related to the employment
					of wealth<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The distinction seems to be between
						owning &lpar;or perhaps getting&rpar; wealth and using it; but a
						probable emendation of the Greek gives &lsquo;how we ought to stand in
						relation to its employment.&rsquo;</note>; about this question there are
					many controversies, owing to those that draw us towards either extreme of life,
					the one school towards parsimony and the other towards luxury. <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The proper configuration of the country it
					is not difficult to state &lpar;though there are some points on which the
					advice of military experts also must be taken&rpar;: on the one hand it
					should be difficult for enemies to invade and easy for the people themselves to
					march out from, <milestone n="1327a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in addition, on the other hand, the same thing
					holds good of the territory that we said about the size of the
					population&mdash;it must be well able to be taken in at one view, and that
					means being a country easy for military defence. As to the site of the city, if
					it is to be ideally placed, it is proper for it to be well situated with regard
					both to the sea and to the country. One defining principle is that mentioned
						above<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">At the beginning of
					5.2.</note>&mdash;the city must be in communication with all parts of the
					territory for the purpose of sending out military assistance; and the remaining
					principle is that it must be easily accessible for the conveyance to it of the
					agricultural produce, and also of timber-wood and any other such material that
					the country happens to possess.<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As to communication with the sea it is in
					fact much debated whether it is advantageous to well-ordered states or harmful.
					It is maintained that the visits of persons brought up under other institutions
					are detrimental to law and order, and so also is a swollen population, which
					grows out of sending out abroad and receiving in a number of traders, but is
					unfavorable to good government. <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now
					it is not difficult to see that, if these consequences are avoided, it is
					advantageous in respect of both security and the supply of necessary
						commodities<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that the city and the
					country should have access to the sea. With a view to enduring wars more easily
					people that are to be secure must be capable of defensive operations on both
					elements, land and sea, and with a view to striking at assailants, even if it be
					not possible on both elements, yet to do so on one or the other will be more in
					the power of people that have access to both. And the importation of commodities
					that they do not happen to have in their own country and the export of their
					surplus products are things indispensable; for the state ought to engage in
					commerce for its own interest, but not for the interest of the foreigner.
						<milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>People that throw open their
					market to the world do so for the sake of revenue, but a state that is not to
					take part in that sort of profit-making need not possess a great commercial
					port. But since even now we see many countries and cities possessing sea-ports
					and harbors conveniently situated with regard to the city, so as not to form
					part of the same town<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek
						should be altered to give &lsquo;part of the town
						itself.&rsquo;</note> and yet not to be too far off, but commanded by
					walls and other defence-works of the kind, it is manifest that if any advantage
					does result through the communication of city with port the state will possess
					this advantage, and if there is any harmful result it is easy to guard against
					it by means of laws stating and regulating what persons are not and what persons
					are to have intercourse with one another. <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the question of naval forces, there is no doubt that to
					possess them up to a certain strength is most desirable <milestone n="1327b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&lpar;for a
					state ought to be formidable, and also capable of the defence of not only its
					own people but also some of its neighbors, by sea as well as by land&rpar;;
					but when we come to the question of the number and size of this force, we have
					to consider the state's manner of life if it is to live a life of leadership and
						affairs,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. relations with other
						states&mdash;a broader term than hegemony, leadership of an
						alliance.</note> it must possess maritime as well as other forces
					commensurate with its activities. <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On
					the other hand it is not necessary for states to include the teeming population
					that grows up in connection with common sailors, as there is no need for these
					to be citizens; for the marines are free men and are a part of the infantry, and
					it is they who have command and control the crew; and if there exists a mass of
					villagers and tillers of the soil, there is bound to be no lack of sailors too.
					In fact we see this state of thing existing even now in some places, for
					instance in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>; the
					Heracleotes man a large fleet of triremes, although they possess a city of but
					moderate size as compared with others.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let such
					then be our conclusions about the territories and harbors of cities, and the
					sea, and about naval forces.<milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>About the citizen population, we said
					before what is its proper limit of numbers. Let us now speak<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of what ought to be the citizens' natural
					character. Now this one might almost discern by looking at the famous cities of
						<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and by observing how the
					whole inhabited world is divided up among the nations.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">4. fin.</note> The nations inhabiting the cold places and
					those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> are full of spirit but
					somewhat deficient in intelligence and skill, so that they continue
					comparatively free, but lacking in political organization and capacity to rule
					their neighbors. The peoples of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> on
					the other hand are intelligent and skillful in temperament, but lack spirit, so
					that they are in continuous subjection and slavery. But the Greek race
					participates in both characters, just as it occupies the middle position
					geographically, for it is both spirited and intelligent; hence it continues to
					be free and to have very good political institutions, and to be capable of
					ruling all mankind if it attains constitutional unity. <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The same diversity also exists among the Greek races
					compared with one another: some have a one-sided nature, others are happily
					blended in regard to both these capacities.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. intelligence and high spirit, capacity for self-government and
						capacity for empire.</note> It is clear therefore that people that are to be
					easily guided to virtue by the lawgiver must be both intellectual and spirited
					in their nature. For as to what is said by certain persons about the character
					that should belong to their Guardians<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The
						ruling class in Plato's Ideal State,<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 375c">Plat. Rep.
							375c</bibl>.</note>&mdash;they should be affectionate to their
					friends but fierce towards strangers&mdash;it is spirit that causes
					affectionateness, for spirit is the capacity of the soul whereby we love.
						<milestone n="1328a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A sign of this is
					that spirit is more roused against associates and friends than against
					strangers, when it thinks itself slighted. Therefore Archilochus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Archilochus of <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName> &lpar;one of the earliest lyric poets, fl. <date value="-600">600</date> B.C., the inventor of the iambic meter, which he
						used for lampoons&rpar;, fr. 61 Bergk, 676 Diehl, 67

					when reproaching his friends, appropriately apostrophizes his spirit: <quote type="verse">
						<l met="lyric">For 'tis thy friends that make thee choke with rage.</l>
					</quote> Moreover it is from this faculty that power to command and love of
					freedom are in all cases derived; for spirit is a commanding and indomitable
					element. But it is a mistake to describe the Guardians as cruel towards
					strangers; it is not right to be cruel towards anybody, and men of great-souled
					nature are not fierce except towards wrongdoers, and their anger is still
					fiercer against their companions if they think that these are wronging them, as
					has been said before. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And this is
					reasonable, because they think that in addition to the harm done them they are
					also being defrauded of a benefit by persons whom they believe to owe them one.

					<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have now approximately decided what are the

					it is also clear that not all the things that are necessary for states to
					possess are to be counted as parts of a state &lpar;any more than this is so
					with any other association that forms something one in kind, for there must be
					something that is one and common and the same for the partners, whether the

					<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but when of two related things one
					is a means and the other an end, in their case there is nothing in common except

					relation between any instrument or artificer and the work that they produce:
					between a house and a builder there is nothing that is produced in common, but
					the builder's craft exists for the sake of the house. Hence although states need
					property, the property is no part of the state. And there are many living things
					that fall under the head of property.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Possibly the words from the beginning of 7.2 &lsquo;But when&rsquo;

						&lsquo;different constitutions.&rsquo;</note> And the state is one
					form of partnership of similar people, and its object is the best life that is
					possible. <milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the greatest
					good is happiness, and this is some perfect activity or employment of virtue,
					and since it has so come about that it is possible for some men to participate
					in it, but for others only to a small extent or not at all, it is clear that
					this is the cause for there arising different kinds and varieties of state and
					several forms of constitution; <milestone n="1328b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for as each set of people pursues
					participation in happiness in a different manner and by different means they
					make for themselves different modes of life and different constitutions. And we
					must also further consider how many there are of these things referred to that
					are indispensable for the existence of a state; for among them will be the
					things which we pronounce to be parts of a state, owing to which their presence
					is essential. <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must therefore
					consider the list of occupations that a state requires : for from these it will
					appear what the indispensable classes are. First then a state must have a supply
					of food; secondly, handicrafts &lpar;since life needs many tools&rpar;;
					third, arms &lpar;since the members of the association must necessarily
					possess arms both to use among themselves and for purposes of government, in
					cases of insubordination, and to employ against those who try to molest them
					from without&rpar;; also a certain abundance of money, in order that they
					may have enough both for their internal needs and for requirements of war;
					fifth, a primary need, the service of religion, termed a priesthood; and sixth
					in number and most necessary of all, a provision for deciding questions of
					interests and of rights between the citizens. <milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These then are the occupations that virtually every state
					requires &lpar;for the state is not any chance multitude of people but one
					self-sufficient for the needs of life, as we say,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. Books 2.1.7, 3.1.8, 5.2.10.</note> and if any of these
					industries happens to be wanting, it is impossible for that association to be
					absolutely self-sufficient&rpar;. It is necessary therefore for the state to
					be organized<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>on the lines of these
					functions; consequently it must possess a number of farmers who will provide the
					food, and craftsmen, and the military class, and the wealthy, and priests and
					judges to decide questions of necessity<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the text should be altered to give &lsquo;matters of
						justice.&rsquo;</note> and of interests.<milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These matters having been
					settled, it remains to consider whether everybody is to take part in all of
					these functions &lpar;for it is possible for the whole of the people to be
					at once farmers and craftsmen and the councillors and judges&rpar;, or
					whether we are to assume different classes corresponding to each of the
					functions mentioned, or whether some of them must necessarily be specialized and
					others combined. But it will not be the same in every form of constitution; for,
					as we said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. Book 4.4 and 14.</note> it is
					possible either for all the people to take part in all the functions or for not
					all to take part in all but for certain people to have certain functions. In
					fact these different distributions of functions are the cause of the difference
					between constitutions: democracies are states in which all the people
					participate in all the functions, oligarchies where the contrary is the case.
						<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But at present we are studying
					the best constitution, and this is the constitution under which the state would
					be most happy, and it has been stated before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1.5.</note> that happiness cannot be forthcoming without virtue; it is
					therefore clear from these considerations that in the most nobly constituted
					state, and the one that possesses men that are absolutely just, not merely just
					relatively to the principle that is the basis of the constitution, the citizens
					must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life &lpar;for such a life is
					ignoble and inimical to virtue&rpar;, nor yet must those who are to be
					citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil <milestone n="1329a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&lpar;for
					leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active
					participation in politics&rpar;. <milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the state also contains the military class and the class that
					deliberates about matters of policy and judges questions of justice, and these
					are manifestly in a special sense parts of the state, are these classes also to
					be set down as distinct or are both functions to be assigned to the same
					persons? But here also the answer is clear, because in a certain sense they
					should be assigned to the same persons, but in a certain sense to different
					ones. Inasmuch as each of these two functions belongs to a different prime of
					life, and one requires wisdom, the other strength, they are to be assigned to
					different people; but inasmuch as it is a thing impossible that when a set of
					men are able to employ force and to resist control, these should submit always
					to be ruled, from this point of view both functions must be assigned to the same
					people; for those who have the power of arms have the power to decide whether
					the constitution shall stand or fall. <milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The only course left them is to assign this constitutional function to both
					sets of men without distinction,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or, amending
						this curious Greek, &lsquo;for the constitution to assign both these
						functions to the same people.&rsquo;</note> yet not simultaneously, but,
					as in the natural order of things strength is found in the younger men and
					wisdom in the elder, it seems to be expedient and just for their functions to be
					allotted to both in this way, for this mode of division possesses conformity
					with merit. <milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover the ownership
					of properties also must be centered round these classes, for the citizens must
					necessarily possess plentiful means, and these are the citizens. For
						the<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>artisan class has no share in
					the state, nor has any other class that is not &lsquo;an artificer of
						virtue.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A Platonic phrase,
							<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 500d">Plat. Rep. 500d</bibl>.</note> And this is
					clear from our basic principle; for in conjunction with virtue happiness is
					bound to be forthcoming, but we should pronounce a state happy having regard not
					to a particular section of it but to all its citizens. And it is also manifest
					that the properties must belong to these classes, inasmuch as<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">As this is a new point, perhaps we should

					of the list enumerated the class of priests; and the position of this class also
					is manifest. Priests must be appointed neither from the tillers of the soil nor
					from the artisans, for it is seemly that the gods should be worshipped by
					citizens; and since the citizen body is divided into two parts, the military
					class and the councillor class, and as it is seemly that those who have
					relinquished these duties owing to age should render to the gods their due
					worship and should spend their retirement in their service, it is to these that
					the priestly offices should be assigned.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have
					therefore stated the things indispensable for the constitution of a state, and
					the things that are parts of a state: tillers of the soil, craftsmen and the

					these divisions is separate from the others, either permanently or by turn.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the &lsquo;appurtenances&rsquo;

					necessary kind are probably taught by need itself, and when the necessaries have
					been provided it is reasonable that things contributing to refinement and luxury
					should find their development; so that we must assume that this is the way with
					political institutions also. <milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					antiquity of all of them is indicated by the history of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; for the Egyptians are reputed to be the
					oldest of nations, but they have always had laws and a political system. Hence
					we should use the results of previous discovery when adequate, while endeavoring
					to investigate matters hitherto passed over.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It
					has been stated before that the land ought to be owned by those who possess arms
					and those who share the rights of the constitution, and why the cultivators
					ought to be a different caste from these, and what is the proper extent and
					conformation of the country. <milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have
					now to discuss first the allotment of the land, and the proper class and
					character of its cultivators; since we advocate not common ownership of land, as
					some have done, <milestone n="1330a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but community in it brought about in a friendly way
					by the use of it,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This vague phrase
						&lpar;based on the proverb <foreign lang="greek">koina\ ta\ tw=n
							fi/lwn</foreign>, &lsquo;friends' goods are common
						property&rsquo;&rpar; seems to denote some sort of customary
						communism in the cultivation of the land and enjoyment of the produce,
						combined with private ownership of the freehold.</note> and we hold that no
					citizen should be ill supplied with means of subsistence. As to common meals,
					all agree that this is an institution advantageous for well-organized states to
					possess; our own reasons for sharing this view we will state later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled.</note> But the
					common meals must be shared by all the citizens, and it is not easy for the poor
					to contribute their assessed share from their private means and also to maintain
					their household as well. <milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					moreover the expenses connected with religion are the common concern of the
					whole state. It is necessary therefore for the land to be divided into two
					parts, of which one must be common and the other the private property of
					individuals; and each of these two divisions must again be divided in two. Of
					the common land one portion should be assigned to the services of religion, and
					the other to defray the cost of the common meals; of the land in private
					ownership one part should be the district near the frontiers, and another the
					district near the city, in order that two plots may be assigned to each citizen
					and all may have a share in both districts. <milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This arrangement satisfies equity and justice, and also
					conduces to greater unanimity in facing border warfare. Where this system is not
					followed, one set of people are reckless about quarrelling with the neighboring
						states,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the other set are too
					cautious and neglect considerations of honor. Hence some people have a law that
					the citizens whose land is near the frontier are not to take part in
					deliberation as to wars against neighboring states, on the ground that private
					interest would prevent them from being able to take counsel wisely. The land
					must therefore be divided up in this manner because of the reasons
						aforesaid.<milestone n="9.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Those who are to cultivate the soil should best of all, if the
					ideal system is to be stated, be slaves, not drawn from people all of one tribe
					nor of a spirited character &lpar;for thus they would be both serviceable
					for their work and safe to abstain from insurrection&rpar;, but as a second
					best they should be alien serfs of a similar nature. Of these laborers those in
					private employment must be among the private possessions of the owners of the
					estates, and those working on the common land common property. How slaves should
					be employed, and why it is advantageous that all slaves should have their
					freedom set before them as a reward, we will say later.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled.</note>
					<milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It
					has been said before that the city should so far as circumstances permit be in
					communication alike with the mainland, the sea and the whole of its territory.
					The site of the city itself we must pray that fortune may place on sloping
					ground, having regard to four considerations<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Apparently &lpar;1&rpar; fresh air, &lpar;2&rpar; water
						supply, &lpar;3&rpar; administration, &lpar;4&rpar; military
						requirements.</note>: first, as a thing essential, the consideration of
					health &lpar;for cities whose site slopes east or towards the breezes that
					blow from the sunrise are more healthy, and in the second degree those that face
					away from the north wind,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Literally,
						&lsquo;in the direction in which the north wind blows.&rsquo;</note>
					for these are milder in winter&rpar;; <milestone n="1330b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and among the remaining considerations, a sloping site is
					favorable both for political and for military purposes. For military purposes
					therefore the site should be easy of exit for the citizens themselves, and
					difficult for the adversary to approach and to blockade, and it must possess if
					possible a plentiful natural supply of pools and springs, but failing this, a
					mode has been invented of supplying water by means of constructing an abundance
					of large reservoirs for rain-water, so that a supply may never fail the citizens
					when they are debarred from their territory by war. <milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we have to consider the health of the
					inhabitants, and this depends upon the place being well situated both on healthy
					ground and with a healthy aspect, and secondly upon using wholesome
					water-supplies, the following matter also must be attended to as of primary
					importance. Those things which we use for the body in the largest quantity, and
					most frequently, contribute most to health; and the influence of the
					water-supply and of the air is of this nature. Hence in wise cities if all the
					sources of water are not equally pure and there is not an abundance of suitable
					springs, the water-supplies for drinking must be kept separate from those for
					other requirements. <milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As to fortified
					positions, what is expedient is not the same for all forms of constitution
					alike; for example, a citadel-hill is suitable for oligarchy and
						monarchy,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and a level site for
					democracy; neither is favorable to an aristocracy, but rather several strong
					positions. The arrangement of the private dwellings is thought to be more
					agreeable and more convenient for general purposes if they are laid out in
					straight streets, after the modern fashion, that is, the one introduced by
						Hippodamus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See Book 2.5.</note>; but it
					is more suitable for security in war if it is on the contrary plan, as cities
					used to be in ancient times; for that arrangement is difficult for foreign
						troops<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. an enemy's mercenaries; but
						the MSS. give &lsquo;difficult for foreign troops to make sorties from
						&lsqb;i.e. presumably to find their way out when once they have got in,
						cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.4.2">Thuc. 2.4.2</bibl>&rsqb; and for attackers to
						find their way about in.&rsquo;</note> to enter and to find their way
					about in when attacking. <milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it
					is well to combine the advantages of both plans &lpar;for this is possible
					if the houses are laid out in the way which among the farmers some people call
					&lsquo;on the slant&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Roman
							<emph>quincunx</emph>, each plant of one row being in line with the gap
						between two plants of the next row, thus:</note> in the case of
					vines&rpar;, and not to lay out the whole city in straight streets, but only
					certain parts and districts, for in this way it will combine security with
						beauty.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>As regards walls, those who aver that
					cities which pretend to valor should not have them hold too old-fashioned a
					view&mdash;and that though they see that the cities that indulge in that
					form of vanity are refuted by experience. <milestone n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is true that against an evenly matched foe and one
					little superior in numbers it is not honorable to try to secure oneself by the
					strength of one's fortifications; but as it does and may happen that the
					superior numbers of the attackers may be too much for the human valor of a small
					force, if the city is to survive and not to suffer disaster or insult, the
					securest fortification of walls must be deemed to be the most warlike,
						<milestone n="1331a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>particularly in view of the inventions that have now been made
					in the direction of precision with missiles and artillery for sieges. <milestone n="10.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To claim not to encompass cities with
					walls is like desiring<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps a word should
						be added to the Greek giving &lsquo;desiring to make the country easy to
						invade, and to strip it&mdash;&rsquo;.</note> the country to be easy
					to invade and stripping it of hilly regions, and similarly not surrounding even
					private dwellings with house-walls on the ground that the inhabitants will be
					cowardly. Another point moreover that must not be forgotten is that those who
					have walls round the city can use their cities in both ways, both as walled
					cities and as open ones, whereas cities not possessing walls cannot be used in
					both ways. <milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If then this is so, not
					only must walls be put round a city, but also attention must be paid to them in
					order that they may be suitable both in regard to the adornment of the city and
					in respect of military requirements, especially the new devices recently
					invented. For just as the attackers of a city are concerned to study the means
					by which they can gain the advantage, so also for the defenders some devices
					have already been invented and others they must discover and think out; for
					people do not even start attempting to attack those who are well
						prepared.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since the multitude of citizens
					must be distributed<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in separate
					messes, and the city walls must be divided up by guard-posts and towers in
					suitable places, it is clear that these facts themselves call for some of the
					messes to be organized at these guard-posts. These things then might be arranged
					in this manner. <milestone n="11.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is fitting
					that the dwellings assigned to the gods and the most important of the official
					messes should have a suitable site, and the same for all, excepting those
					temples which are assigned a special place apart by the law or else by some
					utterance of the Pythian oracle. And the site would be suitable if it is one
					that is sufficiently conspicuous in regard to the excellence of its position,
					and also of superior strength in regard to the adjacent parts of the city.
						<milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is convenient that below
					this site should be laid out an agora of the kind customary in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> which they call a free agora, that
					is, one which has to be kept clear of all merchandise and into which no artisan
					or farmer or any other such person may intrude unless summoned by the
					magistrates. It would give amenity to the site if the gymnasia of the older men
					were also situated here&mdash;for it is proper to have this institution also
					divided according to ages,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or &lsquo;for
						in this noble practice different ages should be separated&rsquo;
						&lpar;Jowett&rpar;.</note> and for certain magistrates to pass their
					time among the youths while the older men spend theirs with the magistrates; for
					the presence of the magistrates before men's eyes most engenders true respect
					and a freeman's awe. <milestone n="1331b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The agora for merchandise must be different from
					the free agora, and in another place; it must have a site convenient for the
					collection there of all the goods sent from the seaport and from the country.
						<milestone n="11.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And as the divisions of the
					state's populace include<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the Greek
						should be altered to <foreign lang="greek">to\ proesto/s</foreign>,
						&lsquo;as the governing class is divided into.&rsquo;</note> priests
					and magistrates, it is suitable that the priests' mess-rooms also should have
					their position round that of the sacred buildings. And all the magistracies that
					superintend contracts, and the registration of actions at law, summonses and
					other such matters of administration, and also those that deal with the control
					of the markets and with what is termed policing the city, should have buildings
					adjacent to an agora or some public place of resort, and such a place is the
					neighborhood of the business agora, for we assign the upper agora as the place
					in which to spend leisure, and this one for necessary business.<milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The
					arrangements in the country also should copy the plan described; there too the
					magistrates called in some states Wardens of the Woods and in others
					Land-superintendents must have their guard-posts and mess-rooms for patrol duty,
					and also temples must be distributed over the country, some dedicated to gods
					and some to heroes. But to linger at this point over the detailed statement and
					discussion of questions of this kind is waste of time.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The difficulty with such things is not so much in
					the matter of theory but in that of practice; to lay down principles is a work
					of aspiration, but their realization is the task of fortune. Hence we will
					relinquish for the present the further consideration of matters of this
						sort.<milestone n="12.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We must now discuss the constitution itself, and ask what and
					of what character should be the components of the state that is to have felicity
					and good government. There are two things in which the welfare of all men
					consists: one of these is the correct establishment of the aim and end of their
					actions, the other the ascertainment of the actions leading to that end.
					&lpar;For the end proposed and the means adopted may be inconsistent with
					one another, as also they may be consistent; sometimes the aim has been
					correctly proposed, but people fail to achieve it in action, sometimes they
					achieve all the means successfully but the end that they posited was a bad one,
					and sometimes they err as to both&mdash;for instance, in medicine
					practitioners are sometimes both wrong in their judgement of what qualities a
					healthy body ought to possess and unsuccessful in hitting on effective means to
					produce the distinctive aim that they have set before them; whereas in the arts
					and sciences both these things have to be secured, the end and the practical
					means to the end.&rpar; <milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now it
					is clear that all men aim at the good life and at happiness, but though some
					possess the power to attain these things, some do not, owing to some factor of
					fortune or of nature &lpar;fortune because the good life needs also a
					certain equipment of means, <milestone n="1332a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and although it needs less of this for men of
					better natural disposition it needs more for those of worse&rpar;; while
					others, although they have the power, go wrong at the start in their search for
						happiness.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. they misconceive the
						nature of happiness and select the wrong thing to aim at.</note> But the
					object before us is to discern the best constitution, and this is the one under
					which a state will be best governed, and a state will be best governed under the
					constitution under which it has the most opportunity for happiness; it is
					therefore clear that we must know what happiness is. <milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The view that we maintain &lpar;and this is the
					definition that we laid down in the<title>Ethics</title>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098a
							16</bibl> and <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1176b">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
							1176b 4</bibl></note> if those discourses are of any value&rpar; is
					that happiness is the complete activity and employment of virtue, and this not
					conditionally but absolutely. When I say &lsquo;conditionally&rsquo; I
					refer to things necessary, by &lsquo;absolutely&rsquo; I mean
					&lsquo;nobly&rsquo;: for instance, to take the case of just actions,
					just acts of vengeance and of punishment spring it is true from virtue, but are
					necessary, and have the quality of nobility only in a limited manner
					&lpar;since it would be preferable that neither individual nor state should
					have any need of such things&rpar;, whereas actions aiming at honors and
						resources<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A conjectural emendation gives
						&lsquo;distinctions.&rsquo;</note> are the noblest actions
					absolutely; for the former class of acts consist in the removal<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This is a conjectural emendation; the MSS.
						give &lsquo;the adoption.&rsquo;</note> of something evil, but
					actions of the latter kind are the opposite&mdash;they are the foundation
					and the generation of things good. <milestone n="12.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The virtuous man will use even poverty, disease, and<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the other forms of bad fortune in a noble manner,
					but felicity consists in their opposites &lpar;for it is a definition
					established by our ethical discourses<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1113a">Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1113a 15 ff.</bibl>
					</note> that the virtuous man is the man of such a character that because of his
					virtue things absolutely good are good to him, and it is therefore clear that
					his employment of these goods must also be virtuous and noble
					absolutely&rpar;; and hence men actually suppose that external goods are the
					cause of happiness, just as if they were to assign the cause of a brilliantly
					fine performance on the harp to the instrument rather than to the skill of the
					player. It follows therefore from what has been said that some goods must be
					forthcoming to start with and others must be provided by the legislator.
						<milestone n="12.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence we pray that the
					organization of the state may be successful in securing those goods which are in
					the control of fortune &lpar;for that fortune does control external goods we
					take as axiomatic&rpar;; but when we come to the state's being virtuous, to
					secure this is not the function of fortune but of science and policy. But then
					the virtue of the state is of course caused by the citizens who share in its
					government being virtuous; and in our state all the citizens share in the
					government. The point we have to consider therefore is, how does a man become
					virtuous? For even if it be possible for the citizens to be virtuous
					collectively without being so individually, the latter is preferable, since for
					each individual to be virtuous entails as a consequence the collective virtue of
					all. <milestone n="12.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there are admittedly three
					things by which men are made good and virtuous, and these three things are
					nature, habit and reason. For to start with, one must be born with the nature of
					a human being and not of some other animal; and secondly, one must be born of a
					certain quality of body and of soul. But there are some qualities that it is of
					no use to be born with, <milestone n="1332b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for our habits make us alter them: some qualities
					in fact are made by nature liable to be modified by the habits in either
					direction, for the worse or for the better. <milestone n="12.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now the other animals live chiefly by nature, though some
					in small degrees are guided by habits too; but man lives by reason also, for he
					alone of animals possesses reason; so that in him these three things must be in
					harmony with one another; for men often act contrary to their acquired habits
					and to their nature because of their reason, if they are convinced that some
					other course of action is preferable.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now we have
						already<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In 4.</note> defined the proper
					natural character of those who are to be amenable to the hand of the legislator;
					what now remains is the task of education, for men learn some things by
					practice, others by precept.<milestone n="13.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But since every political community is
					composed of rulers and subjects, we must therefore consider whether the rulers
					and the subjects ought to change, or to remain the same through life; for it is
					clear that their education also will have to be made to correspond with this
					distribution of functions. If then it were the case that the one class differed
					from the other as widely as we believe the gods and heroes to differ from
					mankind, having first a great superiority in regard to the body and then in
					regard to<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the soul, so that the
					pre-eminence of the rulers was indisputable and manifest to the subjects, it is
					clear that it would be better for the same persons always to be rulers and
					subjects once for all; <milestone n="13.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but as this
					is not easy to secure, and as we do not find anything corresponding to the great
					difference that Scylax states to exist between kings and subjects in <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, it is clear that for many reasons it is
					necessary for all to share alike in ruling and being ruled in turn. For equality
					means for persons who are alike identity of status, and also it is
						difficult<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The emendation suggested by
						Richards gives &lsquo;For equality and identity &lpar;of
						status&rpar; are just for persons who are alike, and it is
						difficult,&rsquo; etc.</note> for a constitution to endure that is
					framed in contravention of justice. For all the people throughout the country
					are ranged on the side of the subject class in wishing for a revolution, and it
					is a thing inconceivable that those in the government should be sufficiently
					numerous to over power all of these together. <milestone n="13.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But yet on the other hand that the rulers ought to be
					superior to the subjects cannot be disputed; therefore the lawgiver must
					consider how this is to be secured, and how they are to participate in the
					government. And this has been already<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">8.3,
						1329a 4 ff.</note> discussed. Nature has given the distinction by making the
					group that is itself the same in race partly younger and partly older, of which
					two sets it is appropriate to the one to be governed and for the other to
					govern; and no one chafes or thinks himself better than his rulers when he is
					governed on the ground of age, especially as he is going to get back what he has
					thus contributed to the common stock when he reaches the proper age. <milestone n="13.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In a sense therefore we must say that the
					rulers and ruled are the same, and in a sense different. <milestone n="1333a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence their
					education also is bound to be in one way the same and in another different. For
					he who is to be a good ruler must have first been ruled, as the saying is<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The sentence here breaks off into a long
						parenthesis, after which it is not resumed.</note> &lpar;and government,
					as has been said in the first discourses,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Book 3.6.6-12, 1278b 30 ff.</note> is of two sorts, one carried on for the
					sake of the ruler and the other for the sake of the subject; of these the former
					is what we call the rule of a master,the latter is the government of free men .
					. .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">One sentence or more has been lost
						here.</note>
					<milestone n="13.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But some of the commands given
					differ not in nature of the services commanded but in their object. Hence a
					number of what are thought to be menial services can be honorably performed even
					by freemen in youth; since in regard to honor and dishonor actions do not differ
					so much in themselves as in their end and object&rpar;. But since we say
					that the goodness of a citizen<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Perhaps the
						Greek should be altered to give &lsquo;of the best
						citizen.&rsquo;</note> and ruler are the same as that of the best man,
					and that the same person ought to become a subject first and a ruler afterwards,
					it will be important for the legislator to study how and by what courses of
					training good men are to be produced, and what is the end of the best
						life.<milestone n="13.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The soul is divided into two parts, of which one is in itself
					possessed of reason, while the other is not rational in itself but capable of
					obeying reason. To these parts in our view belong those virtues in accordance
					with which a man is pronounced to be good in some way. But in which of
						these<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>two parts the end of man
					rather resides, those who define the parts of the soul in accordance with our
					view will have no doubt as to how they should decide. The worse always exists as
					a means to the better, and this is manifest alike in the products of art and in
					those of nature; but the rational part of the soul is better than the
					irrational. <milestone n="13.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the rational part
					is subdivided into two, according to our usual scheme of division; for reason is
					of two kinds, practical and theoretic, so that obviously the rational part of
					the soul must also be subdivided accordingly. A corresponding classification we
					shall also pronounce to hold among its activities: the activities of the part of
					the soul that is by nature superior must be preferable for those persons who are
					capable of attaining either all the soul's activities or two<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. the two lower ones, the three being the activities of
						the theoretic reason, of the practical reason, and of the passions that
						although irrational are amenable to reason.</note> out of the three; since
					that thing is always most desirable for each person which is the highest to
					which it is possible for him to attain. <milestone n="13.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also life as a whole is divided into business and leisure,
					and war and peace, and our actions are aimed some of them at things necessary
					and useful, others at things noble. In these matters the same principle of
					preference that applies to the parts of the soul must apply also to the
					activities of those parts: war must be for the sake of peace, business for the
					sake of leisure, things necessary and useful for the purpose of things noble.
						<milestone n="13.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The statesman therefore must
					legislate with all these considerations in view, both in respect of the parts of
					the soul and of their activities, and aiming more particularly at the greater
					goods and the ends. And the same principle applies in regard to modes of life
					and choices of conduct: a man should be capable of engaging in business and war,
						<milestone n="1333b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but still more capable of living in peace and leisure; and he
					should do what is necessary and useful, but still more should he do what is
					noble. These then are the aims that ought to be kept in view in the education of
					the citizens both while still children and at the later ages that require
					education. <milestone n="13.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the Greek peoples
					reputed at the present day to have the best constitutions, and the lawgivers
					that established them, manifestly did not frame their constitutional systems
					with reference to the best end, nor construct their laws and their scheme of
					education with a view to all the virtues, but they swerved aside in a vulgar
					manner towards those excellences that are supposed to be useful and more
					conducive to gain. And following the same lines as they, some later writers also
					have pronounced the same opinion: in praising the Spartan constitution they
					express admiration for the aim of its founder on the ground that he framed the
					whole of his legislation with a view to conquest and to war. <milestone n="13.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These views are easy to refute on
					theoretical grounds and also have now been refuted by the facts of history. For
					just as most of mankind covet being master of many servants<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or possibly, &lsquo;covet a wide
						empire.&rsquo;</note> because this produces a manifold supply of
					fortune's goods, so Thibron<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Unknown.</note>
					and all the other writers about the Spartan constitution<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>show admiration for the lawgiver of the Spartans
					because owing to their having been trained to meet dangers they governed a wide
					empire. <milestone n="13.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet it clearly follows
					that since as a matter of fact at the present day the Spartans no longer possess
					an empire, they are not happy, and their lawgiver was not a good one. And it is
					ridiculous that although they have kept to his laws, and although nothing
					hinders their observing the laws, they have lost the noble life. Also writers
					have a wrong conception of the power for which the lawgiver should display
					esteem; to govern freemen is nobler and more conjoined with virtue than to rule
					despotically. <milestone n="13.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again it is not
					a proper ground for deeming a state happy and for praising its lawgiver, that it
					has practised conquest with a view to ruling<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A probable emendation gives &lsquo;that he has trained it with a view
						to ruling.&rsquo;</note> over its neighbors. This principle is most
					disastrous; it follows from it that an individual citizen who has the capacity
					ought to endeavor to attain the power to hold sway over his own city; but this
					is just what the Spartans charge as a reproach against their king Pausanias,
					although he attained such high honor. No principle therefore and no law of this
					nature is either statesmanlike or profitable, nor is it true; the same ideals
					are the best both for individuals and for communities, and the lawgiver should
					endeavor to implant them in the souls of mankind. <milestone n="13.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The proper object of practising military training is not
					in order that men may enslave those who do not deserve slavery, but in order
					that first they may themselves avoid becoming enslaved to others; then so that
					they may seek suzerainty for the benefit of the subject people, <milestone n="1334a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but not
					for the sake of world-wide despotism; and thirdly to hold despotic power over
					those who deserve to be slaves. <milestone n="13.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Experience supports the testimony of theory, that it is the duty of the
					lawgiver rather to study how he may frame his legislation both with regard to
					warfare and in other departments for the object of leisure and of peace. Most
					military states remain safe while at war but perish when they have won their
					empire; in peace-time they lose their keen temper, like iron.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. an iron blade when not used loses
						keenness and has to be re-tempered.</note> The lawgiver is to blame, because
					he did not educate them to be able to employ leisure.<milestone n="13.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since it appears that
					men have the same end collectively and individually, and since the same
					distinctive aim must necessarily belong both to the best man and to the best
					government, it is clear that the virtues relating to leisure are essential<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. to the state as well as to the
						individual.</note>; since, as has been said repeatedly, peace is the end of
					war, leisure of business. <milestone n="13.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the
					virtues useful for leisure and for its employment are not only those that
					operate during leisure but also those that operate in business; for many of the
					necessaries must needs be forthcoming to give us opportunity for leisure.
					Therefore it is proper for the state to be temperate,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>brave and enduring; since, as the proverb goes,
					there is no leisure for slaves, but people unable to face danger bravely are the
					slaves of their assailants. <milestone n="13.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore courage and fortitude are needed for business, love of wisdom for
					leisure, temperance and justice for both seasons, and more especially when men
					are at peace and have leisure; for war compels men to be just and temperate,
					whereas the enjoyment of prosperity and peaceful leisure tend to make them
					insolent. <milestone n="13.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore much justice
					and much temperance are needed by those who are deemed very prosperous and who
					enjoy all the things counted as blessings, like the persons, if such there be,
					as the poets say,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Hes. WD 170">Hes. WD 170 ff.</bibl>
					</note> that dwell in the Islands of the Blest; these will most need wisdom,
					temperance and justice, the more they are at leisure and have an abundance of
					such blessings. It is clear therefore why a state that is to be happy and
					righteous must share in these virtues; for if it is disgraceful to be unable to
					use our good things, it is still more disgraceful to be unable to use them in
					time of leisure, and although showing ourselves good men when engaged in
					business and war, in times of peace and leisure to seem no better than slaves.
						<milestone n="13.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore we must not
					cultivate virtue after the manner of the state of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. The superiority of the Spartans
					over other races does not lie <milestone n="1334b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in their holding a different opinion from
					others as to what things are the greatest goods, but rather in their believing
					that these are obtained by means of one particular virtue; yet because they both
					deem these things and their enjoyment to be greater goods than the enjoyment of
					the virtues . . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The end of this sentence
						and the beginning of the next appear to have been lost.</note>
					<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>. . . and that it is to be practised for its own
					sake is manifest from these considerations; <milestone n="13.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but it must now be considered how and by what means this
					will come about. Now we have indeed previously decided that it requires nature
					and habit and reason, and among these, what particular quality of nature men
					ought to possess has been defined previously; but it remains to consider whether
					men ought to be educated first by means of the reason or by the habits. For
					between reason and habit the most perfect harmony ought to exist, as it is
					possible both for the reason to have missed the highest principle and for men to
					have been as wrongly trained through the habits. <milestone n="13.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This therefore at all events is clear in the first place,
					in the case of men as of other creatures, that their engendering starts from a
					beginning, and that the end starts from a certain beginning that is another
						end,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A conjectural addition to the text
						gives &lsquo;the end to which a certain beginning leads is itself the
						beginning of another end.&rsquo; The active use of the reason is the end
						&lpar;i.e. the completion and the purpose&rpar; of the birth and
						growth of the human animal.</note> and that reason and intelligence are for
					us the end of our natural development, so that it is with a view to these ends
					that our engendering and the training of our habits must be regulated.
						<milestone n="13.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And secondly, as soul and body
					are two, so we observe that the soul also has two parts, the irrational part and
					the part possessing reason, and that the states which they experience are two in
						number,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the one being desire and
					the other intelligence; and as the body is prior in its development to the soul,
					so the irrational part of the soul is prior to the rational. And this also is
					obvious, because passion and will, and also appetite,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">These three emotions are subdivisions of
						&lsquo;desire&rsquo; above.</note> exist in children even as soon as
					they are born, but it is the nature of reasoning and intelligence to arise in
					them as they grow older. Therefore in the first place it is necessary for the
					training of the body to precede that of the mind, and secondly for the training
					of the appetite to precede that of the intelligence; but the training of the
					appetite must be for the sake of the intellect, and that of the body for the
					sake of the soul.<milestone n="14.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Inasmuch therefore as it is the duty of the lawgiver to
					consider from the start how the children reared are to obtain the best bodily
					frames, he must first pay attention to the union of the sexes, and settle when
					and in what condition a couple should practise matrimonial intercourse. In
					legislating for this partnership he must pay regard partly to the persons
					themselves and to their span of life, so that they may arrive together at the
					same period in their ages, and their powers may not be at discord through the
					man being still capable of parentage and the wife incapable, or the wife capable
					and the man not &lpar;for this causes differences and actual discord between
					them&rpar;, <milestone n="14.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and also he must
					consider as well the succession of the children, for the children must neither
					be too far removed in their ages from the fathers &lpar;since elderly
					fathers get no good from their children's return of their favors, nor do the
					children from the help they get from the fathers&rpar;, <milestone n="1335a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>nor must they be
					too near them &lpar;for this involves much unpleasantness, since in such
					families there is less respect felt between them, as between companions of the
					same age, and also the nearness of age leads to friction in household
					affairs&rpar;; and in addition, to return to the point from which we began
					this digression, measures must be taken to ensure that the children produced may
					have bodily frames suited to the wish of the lawgiver. <milestone n="14.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These results then are almost all attained by one
					mode of regulation. For since the period of parentage terminates, speaking
					generally, with men at the age of seventy at the outside, and with women at
					fifty, the commencement of their union should correspond in respect of age with
					these times. <milestone n="14.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the mating of the
					young is bad for child-bearing; for in all animal species the offspring of the
					young are more imperfect and likely to produce female children,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Some editors write <foreign lang="greek">qhlu/toka</foreign> and interpret &lsquo;more likely to be born
						females.&rsquo; &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">qhluto/ka</foreign>,
						&lsquo;likely to bear females,&rsquo; is applied to the young
						parents themselves in <bibl n="Aristot. HA 766b.29">Aristot. Hist. An. 766b
							29</bibl>.&rpar;</note> and small in figure, so that the same thing
					must necessarily occur in the human race also. And a proof of this is that in
					all the states where it is the local custom to mate young men and young women,
					the people are deformed and small of body. And again young women labor more, and
					more of them die in childbirth; indeed according to some accounts such was the
					reason why the oracle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><foreign lang="greek">*mh\ te/mne ne/an a)/loka</foreign>&lpar;&lsquo;cut not a new
						furrow&rsquo;&rpar; schol.</note> was given<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to the people of <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName>, because many were dying owing to its being their
					custom for the women to marry young, and it did not refer to the harvest.
						<milestone n="14.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again it also contributes
					to chastity for the bestowal of women in marriage to be made when they are
					older, for it is thought that they are more licentious when they have had
					intercourse in youth. Also the males are thought to be arrested in bodily growth
					if they have intercourse while the seed is still growing, for this also has a
					fixed period after passing which it is no longer plentiful. <milestone n="14.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore it is fitting for the women to be married
					at about the age of eighteen and the men at thirty-seven or a little before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The word &lsquo;before&rsquo; is a
						conjectural insertion.</note>&mdash;for that will give long enough for
					the union to take place with their bodily vigor at its prime, and for it to
					arrive with a convenient coincidence of dates at the time when procreation
					ceases. Moreover the succession of the children to the estates, if their birth
					duly occurs soon after the parents marry, will take place when they are
					beginning their prime, and when the parents' period of vigor has now come to a
					close, towards the age of seventy. <milestone n="14.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The proper age therefore for union has been discussed; as to the proper times
					in respect of the season we may accept what is customary with most people, who
					have rightly decided even as it is to practise marital cohabitation in winter.
					And people should also study for themselves, when their time comes, the
					teachings of physicians and natural philosophers on the subject of the
					procreation of children; the suitable bodily seasons are adequately discussed by
					the physicians, <milestone n="1335b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the question of weather by the natural
					philosophers, who say that north winds are more favorable than south. <milestone n="14.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The particular kind of bodily constitution
					in the parents that will be most beneficial for the offspring must be dwelt on
					more in detail in our discussion of the management of children<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This was never written, or has been
						lost.</note>; it is sufficient to speak of it in outline now. The athlete's
					habit of body is not serviceable for bodily fitness as required by a citizen,
					nor for health and parentage, nor yet is a habit that is too valetudinarian and
					unfit for labor, but the condition that lies between them. The bodily habit
					therefore should have been trained by exercise, but not by exercises that are
					violent, and not for one form of labor only, as is the athlete's habit of body,
					but for the pursuits of free men. And these arrangements must be provided alike
					for men and women. <milestone n="14.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And pregnant
					women also must take care of their bodies, not avoiding exercise nor adopting a
					low diet; this it is easy for the lawgiver to secure by ordering them to make a
					journey daily for the due worship of the deities whose office is the control of
					childbirth. As regards the mind, however, on the contrary it suits them to pass
					the time more indolently than as regards their bodies; for children before birth
					are evidently affected by the mother just as growing plants are by the
						earth.<milestone n="14.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As to exposing
						or<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>rearing the children born, let
					there be a law that no deformed child shall be reared; but on the ground of
					number of children, if the regular customs hinder any of those born being
					exposed, there must be a limit fixed to the procreation of offspring, and if any
					people have a child as a result of intercourse in contravention of these
					regulations, abortion must be practised on it before it has developed sensation
					and life; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by
					the fact of having sensation and being alive. <milestone n="14.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the beginning of the fit age for a man and for a
					woman, at which they are to begin their union, has been defined, let it also be
					decided for how long a time it is suitable for them to serve the state in the
					matter of producing children. For the offspring of too elderly parents, as those
					of too young ones, are born imperfect both in body and mind, and the children of
					those that have arrived at old age are weaklings. Therefore the period must be
					limited to correspond with the mental prime; and this in the case of most men is
					the age stated by some of the poets, who measure men's age by periods of seven
						years,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Sol. Fr. 27">Solon fr. 27</bibl>
					</note>&mdash;it is about the age of fifty. <milestone n="14.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore persons exceeding this age by four or five years
					must be discharged from the duty of producing children for the community, and
					for the rest of their lives if they have intercourse it must be manifestly for
					the sake of health or for some other similar reason. As to intercourse with
					another woman or man, in general it must be dishonorable for them to be known to
					take any part in it in any circumstances whatsoever as long as they are husband
					and wife and bear those names, but any who may be discovered doing anything of
					the sort during their period of parentage <milestone n="1336a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>must be punished with a loss of
					privilege suited to the offence.<milestone n="15.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When the children have been born, the
					particular mode of rearing adopted must be deemed an important determining
					influence in regard to their power of body. It appears from examining the other
					animals, and is also shown by the foreign races that make it their aim to keep
					up the military habit of body, that a diet giving an abundance of milk is most
					suited to the bodies of children, and one that allows rather little wine because
					of the diseases that it causes. <milestone n="15.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover it is advantageous to subject them to as many movements as are
					practicable with children of that age. To prevent the limbs from being distorted
					owing to softness, some races even now employ certain mechanical appliances that
					keep the bodies of infants from being twisted. And it is also advantageous to
					accustom them at once from early childhood to cold, for this is most useful both
					for health and with a view to military service. Hence among many non-Greek races
					it is customary in the case of some peoples to wash the children at birth by
					dipping them in a cold river, and with others, for instance the Celts, to give
					them scanty covering. <milestone n="15.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is
					better to inure them at the very start to everything possible, but to inure them
						gradually;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the bodily habit of
					children is naturally well fitted by warmth to be trained to bear cold. In the
					earliest period of life then it is expedient to employ this or a similar method
					of nursing; <milestone n="15.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the next period to
					this, up to the age of five, which it is not well to direct as yet to any study
					nor to compulsory labors, in order that they may not hinder the growth, should
					nevertheless be allowed enough movement to avoid bodily inactivity; and this
					exercise should be obtained by means of various pursuits, particularly play. But
					even the games must not be unfit for freemen, nor laborious, nor undisciplined.
						<milestone n="15.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also the question of the kind
					of tales and stories that should be told to children of this age must be
					attended to by the officials called Children's Tutors. For all such amusements
					should prepare the way for their later pursuits; hence most children's games
					should be imitations of the serious occupations of later life. <milestone n="15.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The legislators in
						the<title>Laws</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Plat. Laws 792a">Plat. Laws 792a</bibl>. Plato merely says that a
						child's crying shows it to be annoyed, and that it ought to have as little
						pain as possible or else it will grow up morose.</note> forbid allowing
					children to have paroxysms of crying, but this prohibition is a mistake; violent
					crying contributes to growth, for it serves in a way as exercise for the body,
					since holding the breath is the strength giving factor in hard labor, and this
					takes place also with children when they stretch themselves in crying. The
					Tutors must supervise the children's pastimes, and in particular must see that
					they associate as little as possible with slaves. For children of this age,
						<milestone n="1336b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and up to seven years old, must necessarily be reared at home;
						<milestone n="15.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>so it is reasonable to suppose
					that even at this age they may acquire a taint of illiberality from what they
					hear and see. The lawgiver ought therefore to banish indecent talk, as much as
					anything else, out of the state altogether &lpar;for light talk about
					anything disgraceful soon passes into action&rpar;&mdash;so most of all
					from among the young, so that they may not say nor hear anything of the sort;
					and anybody found saying or doing any of the things prohibited, if he is of free
					station but not yet promoted to reclining at the public meals, must be punished
					with marks of dishonor and with beating, and an older offender must be punished
					with marks of dishonor degrading to a free man, because of his slavish behavior.
						<milestone n="15.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we banish any talk of
					this kind, clearly we must also banish the seeing of either pictures or
					representations that are indecent. The officials must therefore be careful that
					there may be no sculpture or painting that represents indecent actions, except
					in the temples of a certain class of gods to whom the law allows even
					scurrility; but in regard to these<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MS.
						text gives &lsquo;and in addition to these&rsquo;; and the word
						&lsquo;still&rsquo; may be an interpolation.</note> the law permits
					men still of suitable age to worship the gods both on their own behalf and on
					behalf of the children and women.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="15.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the younger ones must not
					be allowed in the audience at lampoons<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Iambic
						verses, often abusive and indecent, recited at festivals of Dionysus.</note>
					and at comedy, before they reach the age at which they will now have the right
					to recline at table in company and to drink deeply, and at which their education
					will render all of them immune to the harmful effects of such things. For the
					present therefore we have merely mentioned these matters in passing, but later
					we must stop to settle them more definitely, first discussing fully whether
					legislation prohibiting the attendance of the young is desirable or not, and how
					such prohibition should be put in force; but on the present occasion we have
					touched on the question only in the manner necessary. <milestone n="15.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For perhaps the tragic actor Theodorus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A great Athenian performer of Sophocles; he
						took the part of Antigone.</note> used to put the matter not badly: he had
					never once allowed anybody to produce his part<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Loosely put for &lsquo;to appear on the
						stage.&rsquo;</note> before him, not even one of the poor actors, as he
					said that audiences are attracted by what they hear first; and this happens
					alike in regard to our dealings with people and to our dealings with
					things&mdash;all that comes first we like better. On this account we ought
					to make all base things unfamiliar to the young, and especially those that
					involve either depravity or malignity.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But when
					the five years from two to seven have passed, the children must now become
					spectators at the lessons<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. in gymnastics
						and music.</note> which they will themselves have to learn. <milestone n="15.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there are two ages corresponding to
					which education should be divided&mdash;there must be a break after the
					period from seven to puberty, and again after that from puberty to twenty-one.
					For those who divide the ages by periods of seven years are generally speaking
					not wrong,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The MSS. give &lsquo;not
						right.&rsquo;</note>
					<milestone n="1337a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and it is proper to follow the division of nature, for all art and education
					aim at filling up nature's deficiencies. First therefore we must consider
					whether some regulation in regard to the boys ought to be instituted, next
					whether it is advantageous for their supervision to be conducted on a public
					footing or in a private manner as is done at present in most states, and thirdly
					of what particular nature this supervision ought to be.</p>

					nobody would dispute that the education of the young requires the special
					attention of the lawgiver. Indeed the neglect of this in states is injurious to
					their constitutions; for education ought to be adapted to the particular form of
					constitution, since the particular character belonging to each constitution both
					guards the constitution generally and originally establishes it&mdash;for
					instance the democratic spirit promotes democracy and the oligarchic spirit
					oligarchy; and the best spirit always causes a better constitution. <milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover in regard to all the faculties and
					crafts certain forms of preliminary education<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and training in their various operations are necessarys o that
					manifestly this is also requisite in regard to the actions of virtue. And
					inasmuch as the end for the whole state is one, it is manifest that education
					also must necessarily be one and the same for all and that the superintendence
					of this must be public, and not on private lines, in the way in which at present
					each man superintends the education of his own children, teaching them
					privately, and whatever special branch of knowledge he thinks fit. But matters
					of public interest ought to be under public supervision; at the same time we
					ought not to think that any of the citizens belongs to himself, but that all
					belong to the state, for each is a part of the state, and it is natural for the
					superintendence of the several parts to have regard to the superintendence of
					the whole. <milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And one might praise the
					Spartans in respect of this, for they pay the greatest attention to the training
					of their children, and conduct it on a public system.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is clear then that there should be legislation about
					education and that it should be conducted on a public system. But consideration
					must be given to the question, what constitutes education and what is the proper
					way to be educated. At present there are differences of opinion as to the proper
					tasks to be set; for all peoples do not agree as to the things that the young
					ought to learn, either with a view to virtue or with a view to the best life,
					nor is it clear whether their studies should be regulated more with regard to
					intellect or with regard to character. <milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And confusing questions arise out of the education that
					actually prevails, and it is not at all clear whether the pupils should practise
					pursuits that are practically morally edifying, or higher
					accomplishments&mdash;for all these views have won the support of some
					judges; <milestone n="1337b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and nothing is agreed as regards the exercise conducive to
					virtue, for, to start with, all men do not honor the same virtue, so that they
					naturally hold different opinions in regard to training in virtue.<milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is
					therefore not difficult to see that the young must be taught those useful arts
					that are indispensably necessary; but it is clear that they should not be taught
					all the useful arts, those pursuits that are liberal being kept distinct from
					those that are illiberal, and that they must participate in such among the
					useful arts as will not render the person who participates in them vulgar. A
					task and also an art or a science must be deemed vulgar if it renders the body
					or soul or mind of free men useless for the employments and actions of virtue.
					Hence we entitle vulgar all such arts as deteriorate the condition of the body,
					and also the industries that earn wages; for they make the mind preoccupied and
					degraded. <milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And even with the liberal
					sciences, although it is not illiberal to take part in some of them up to a
					point, to devote oneself to them too assiduously and carefully is liable to have
					the injurious results specified. Also it makes much difference what object one
					has in view in a pursuit or study; if one follows it for the sake of oneself or
					one's friends, or on moral grounds, it is not illiberal,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but the man who follows the same pursuit because of
					other people would often appear to be acting in a menial and servile
						manner.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The branches of study at present
					established fall into both classes, as was said before.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1.4.</note>
					<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There are perhaps four customary
					subjects of education, reading and writing, gymnastics, music, and fourth, with
					some people, drawing; reading and writing and drawing being taught as being
					useful for the purposes of life and very serviceable, and gymnastics as
					contributing to manly courage; but as to music, here one might raise a question.
					For at present most people take part in it for the sake of pleasure; but those,
					who originally included it in education did so because, as has often been said,
					nature itself seeks to be able not only to engage rightly in business but also
					to occupy leisure nobly; for&mdash;to speak about it yet again<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Cf. Book 7, 1334a 2-10.</note>&mdash;this
					is the first principle of all things. <milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if although both business and leisure are necessary, yet leisure is more
					desirable and more fully an end than business, we must inquire what is the
					proper occupation of leisure. For assuredly it should not be employed in play,
					since it would follow that play is our end in life. But if this is impossible,
					and sports should rather be employed in our times of business &lpar;for a
					man who is at work needs rest, and rest is the object of play, while business is
					accompanied by toil and exertion&rpar;, it follows that in introducing
					sports we must watch the right opportunity for their employment, since we are
					applying them to serve as medicine; for the activity of play is a relaxation of
					the soul, and serves as recreation because of its pleasantness. <milestone n="1338a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But leisure seems itself to
					contain pleasure and happiness and felicity of life. And this is not possessed
					by the busy but by the leisured; for the busy man busies himself for the sake of
					some end as not being in his possession, but happiness is an end achieved, which
					all men think is accompanied by pleasure and not by pain. But all men do not go
					on to define this pleasure in the same way, but according to their various
					natures and to their own characters, and the pleasure with which the best man
					thinks that happiness is conjoined is the best pleasure and the one arising from
					the noblest sources. So that it is clear that some subjects must be learnt and
					acquired merely with a view to the pleasure in their pursuit, and that these
					studies and these branches of learning are ends in themselves, while the forms
					of learning related to business are studied as necessary and as means to other
					things. <milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence our predecessors
					included music in education not as a necessity &lpar;for there is nothing
					necessary about it&rpar;, nor as useful &lpar;in the way in which
					reading and writing are useful for business and for household management and for
					acquiring learning and for many pursuits of civil life, while drawing also seems
					to be useful in making us better judges of the works of artists&rpar;, nor
					yet again as we pursue gymnastics,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for
					the sake of health and strength &lpar;for we do not see either of these
					things produced as a result of music&rpar;; it remains therefore that it is
					useful as a pastime in leisure, which is evidently the purpose for which people
					actually introduce it, for they rank it as a form of pastime that they think
					proper for free men. For this reason Homer wrote thus: <quote type="verse">

					<milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is
					clear therefore that there is a form of education in which boys should be
					trained not because it is useful or necessary but as being liberal and noble;
					though whether there is one such subject of education or several, and what these
					are and how they are to be pursued, must be discussed later,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This promise is not fulfilled.</note> but as it is we have
					made this much progress on the way, that we have some testimony even from the
					ancients, derived from the courses of education which they founded&mdash;for
					the point is proved by music. And it is also clear that some of the useful
					subjects as well ought to be studied by the young not only because of their
					utility, like the study of reading and writing, but also because they may lead
					on to many other branches of knowledge; <milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and similarly they should study drawing not in order that
					they may not go wrong in their private purchases and may avoid being cheated in
					buying and selling furniture, <milestone n="1338b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but rather because this study makes a man
					observant of bodily beauty; and to seek for utility everywhere is entirely
					unsuited to men that are great-souled and free. And since it is plain that
					education by habit must come before education by reason, and training of the
					body before training of the mind, it is clear from these considerations that the
					boys must be handed over to the care of the wrestling-master and the trainer;
					for the latter imparts a certain quality to the habit of the body and the former
					to its actions.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now at the present time some of the states reputed to pay the
					greatest attention to children produce in them an athletic habit<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. premature and disproportionate muscular
						development, directed to some particular competition. Cf. 1288b 12
						ff.</note> to the detriment of their bodily form and growth, while the
					Spartans although they have avoided this error yet make their boys animal in
					nature by their laborious exercises, in the belief that this is most
					contributory to manly courage. Yet, as has often been said, it is not right to
					regulate education with a view to one virtue only, or to this one most of all;
					indeed they do not even investigate the question whether this virtue is to be
					had in view at all. For neither in the lower animals nor in the case of foreign
					races do we see that courage goes with the wildest, but rather with the gentler
					and lion-like temperaments.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Aristot. HA 629b.8">Aristot. Hist. An. 629b 8</bibl> &lpar;the
						lion is gentle except when hungry&rpar;; <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 231a">Plat. Soph. 231a</bibl> &lpar;the dog the gentlest of

					<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there are many<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>foreign races inclined to murder and cannibalism,
					for example among the tribes of the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black
						Sea</placeName> the Achaeans and Heniochi, and others of the mainland races,
					some in the same degree as those named and some more, which although piratical
					have got no share of manly courage. And again we know that even the Spartans,
					although so long as they persisted by themselves in their laborious exercises
					they surpassed all other peoples, now fall behind others both in gymnastic and
					in military contests; for they used not to excel because they exercised their
					young men in this fashion but only because they trained and their adversaries
					did not. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Consequently honor and not
					animal ferocity should play the first part; for it is not a wolf nor one of the
					other wild animals that will venture upon any noble hazard, but rather a good
					man. But those who let boys pursue these hard exercises too much and turn them
					out untrained in necessary things in real truth render them vulgar, making them
					available for statesmanship to use for one task only, and even for this task
					training them worse than others do, as our argument proves. And<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">This sentence would come better at the end of
						3.4.</note> we must not judge them from their former achievements but from
					the facts of today; for they have rivals in their education now, but they used
					to have none before.<milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is therefore agreed that we should employ gymnastic
					training, and how we should employ it. For until puberty we should apply lighter
					exercises, forbidding hard diet and severe exertions, in order that nothing may
					hinder the growth; <milestone n="1339a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for there is no small proof that too severe
					training can produce this result in the fact that in the list of Olympic victors
					one would only find two or three persons who have won both as men and as boys,
					because when people go into training in youth the severe exercises rob them of
					their strength. <milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But when they have
					spent three years after puberty upon their other studies, then it is suitable to
					occupy the next period of life with laborious exercises and strict training
						diet<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. compulsion to eat very large
						rations of prescribed food&mdash;the Greek way of training.</note>; for
					it is wrong to work hard with the mind and the body at the same time; for it is
					the nature of the two different sorts of exertion to produce opposite effects,
					bodily toil impeding the development of the mind and mental toil that of the
						body.<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>About music on the other hand we have previously raised some
					questions in the course of our argument, but it is well to take them up again
					and carry them further now, in order that this may give the key so to speak for
					the principles which one might advance in pronouncing about it. For it is not
					easy to say precisely what potency it possesses, nor yet for the sake of what
					object one should participate in it&mdash;whether for amusement and
					relaxation, as one indulges in sleep and deep drinking &lpar;for these in
					themselves are not serious pursuits but merely pleasant, and &lsquo;relax
					our care,&rsquo; as Euripides says<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham"><bibl n="Eur. Ba. 378">Eur. Ba. 378</bibl> &lpar;Bromios&rpar;
							<foreign lang="greek">o(\s ta/d' e)/xei, qiaseu/ein te xo/rois meta/ t'
							au)lw=n gela=sai a)napau=sai/ te meri/mnas</foreign></note>; owing to
					which people actually class music with them and<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>employ all of these things, sleep, deep drinking and music, in
					the same way, and they also place dancing in the same class&rpar;;
						<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>or whether we ought rather to
					think that music tends in some degree to virtue &lpar;music being capable of
					producing a certain quality of character just as gymnastics are capable of
					producing a certain quality of body, music accustoming men to be able to rejoice
					rightly&rpar;; or that it contributes something to intellectual
						entertainment<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The term <foreign lang="greek">diagwgh/</foreign>, &lsquo;pastime,&rsquo; is
						idiomatically used of the pursuits of cultured leisure&mdash;serious
						conversation, music, the drama.</note> and culture &lpar;for this must
					be set down as a third alternative among those mentioned&rpar;. Now it is
					not difficult to see that one must not make amusement the object of the
					education of the young; for amusement does not go with
					learning&mdash;learning is a painful process. Nor yet moreover is it
					suitable to assign intellectual entertainment to boys and to the young; for a
					thing that is an end does not belong to anything that is imperfect. <milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But perhaps it might be thought that the
					serious pursuits of boys are for the sake of amusement when they have grown up
					to be men. But, if something of this sort is the case, why should the young need
					to learn this accomplishment themselves, and not, like the Persian and Median
					kings, participate in the pleasure and the education of music by means of others
					performing it? for those who have made music a business and profession must
					necessarily perform better than those who practise only long enough to learn.
					But if it is proper for them to labor at accomplishments of this sort, then it
					would also be right for them to prepare the dishes of an elaborate cuisine; but
					this is absurd. <milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the same
					difficulty also arises as to the question whether learning music can improve
					their characters; for why should they learn to perform edifying music
					themselves, <milestone n="1339b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>instead of learning to enjoy it rightly and be able to judge it
					when they hear others performing, as the Spartans do? for the Spartans although
					they do not learn to perform can nevertheless judge good and bad music
					correctly, so it is said. And the same argument applies also if music is to be
					employed for refined enjoyment and entertainment; why need people learn to
					perform themselves instead of enjoying music played by others? <milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And we may consider the conception that we
					have about the gods: Zeus does not sing and harp to the poets himself. But
					professional musicians we speak of as vulgar people, and indeed we think it not
					manly to perform music, except when drunk or for fun.<milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But perhaps these points
					will have to be considered afterwards; our first inquiry is whether music ought
					not or ought to be included in education, and what is its efficacy among the
					three uses of it that have been discussed&mdash;does it serve for education
					or amusement or entertainment? It is reasonable to reckon it under all of these
					heads, and it appears to participate in them all. Amusement is for the sake of
					relaxation, and relaxation must necessarily be pleasant, for it is a way of
					curing the pain due to laborious work; also entertainment ought admittedly to be
					not only honorable but also pleasant, for happiness is derived from both honor
					and pleasure;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but we all pronounce
					music to be one of the pleasantest things, whether instrumental or instrumental
					and vocal music together <milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;at least Musaeus<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A semi-legendary
						bard, to whom a number of oracular verses that were current were
						attributed.</note> says, &lsquo;Song is man's sweetest joy,&rsquo;
					and that is why people with good reason introduce it at parties and
					entertainments, for its exhilarating effect&rpar;, so that for this reason
					also one might suppose that the younger men ought to be educated in music. For
					all harmless pleasures are not only suitable for the ultimate object but also
					for relaxation; and as it but rarely happens for men to reach their ultimate
					object, whereas they often relax and pursue amusement not so much with some
					ulterior object but because of the pleasure of it, it would be serviceable to
					let them relax at intervals in the pleasures derived from music. <milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it has come about that men make
					amusements an end; for the end also perhaps contains a certain pleasure, but not
					any ordinary pleasure, and seeking this they take the other as being this
					because it has a certain resemblance to the achievement of the end of their
					undertakings. For the end is desirable not for the sake of anything that will
					result from it, and also pleasures of the sort under consideration are not
					desirable for the sake of some future result, but because of things that have
					happened already, for instance labor and pain. One might then perhaps assume
					this to be the reason which causes men to seek to procure happiness by means of
					those pleasures; <milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in the case of
					taking part in music, this is not because of this reason only, but also because
					performing music is useful, as it seems, for relaxation. But nevertheless we
					must examine whether it is not the case that, although this has come about,
						<milestone n="1340a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>yet the nature of music is more honorable than corresponds with
					the employment of it mentioned, and it is proper not only to participate in the
					common pleasure that springs from it, which is perceptible to everybody
					&lpar;for the pleasure contained in music is of a natural kind, owing to
					which the use of it is dear to those of all ages and characters&rpar;, but
					to see if its influence reaches also in a manner to the character and to the
					soul. And this would clearly be the case if we are affected in our characters in
					a certain manner by it. <milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is
					clear that we are affected in a certain manner, both by many other kinds of
					music and not least by the melodies of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A Phrygian composer
						of the seventh century B.C.</note>; for these admittedly make our souls
					enthusiastic, and enthusiasm is an affection of the character of the soul. And
					moreover everybody when listening to imitations<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Music dramatically expressing various states of
						emotion.</note> is thrown into a corresponding state of feeling, even apart
					from the rhythms and tunes themselves.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A
						probable correction of the Greek gives &lsquo;by the rhythms and tunes
						themselves, even apart from the words.&rsquo;</note> And since it is the
					case that music is one of the things that give pleasure, and that virtue has to
					do with feeling delight and love and hatred rightly, there is obviously nothing
					that it is more needful to learn and become habituated to than to judge
					correctly and to delight in virtuous characters and noble actions; <milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but rhythms and melodies contain
					representations of anger<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and mildness,
					and also of courage and temperance and all their opposites and the other moral
					qualities, that most closely correspond to the true natures of these qualities
					&lpar;and this is clear from the facts of what occurs&mdash;when we
					listen to such representations we change in our soul&rpar;; and habituation
					in feeling pain and delight at representations of reality is close to feeling
					them towards actual reality &lpar;for example, if a man delights in
					beholding the statue of somebody for no other reason than because of its actual
					form, the actual sight of the person whose statue he beholds must also of
					necessity give him pleasure&rpar;; <milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and it is the case that whereas the other objects of
					sensation contain no representation of character, for example the objects of
					touch and taste &lpar;though the objects of sight do so slightly, for there
					are forms that represent character, but only to a small extent, and not<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">&lsquo;Not&rsquo; is a conjectural
						insertion.</note> all men participate in visual perception of such
					qualities; also visual works of art are not representations of character but
					rather the forms and colors produced are mere indications of character, and
					these indications are only bodily sensations during the emotions; not but what
					in so far as there is a difference even in regard to the observation of these
						indications,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. these visual
						impressions do vary to some extent in moral effect.</note> the young must
					not look at the works of Pauson but those of Polygnotus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Pauson is a painter otherwise little known. Polygnotus
						decorated the Stoa Poikile and other famous public buildings at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in the middle of the 5th

						5</bibl>&rpar;.</note> and of any other moral painter or
					sculptor&rpar;, <milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>pieces of music
					on the contrary do actually contain in them selves imitations of character; and
					this is manifest, for even in the nature of the mere melodies there are
					differences, so that people when hearing them are affected differently and have
					not the same feelings in regard to each of them, but listen to some in a more
					mournful and restrained state, <milestone n="1340b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for instance the mode called Mixolydian, and
					to others in a softer state of mind, but in a midway state and with the greatest
					composure to another, as the Dorian mode alone of tunes seems to act, while the
					Phrygian makes men enthusiastic; <milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for
					these things are well stated by those who have studied this form of education,
					as they derive the evidence for their theories from the actual facts of
					experience. And the same holds good about the rhythms also, for some have a more
					stable and others a more emotional character, and of the latter some are more
					vulgar in their emotional effects and others more liberal. From these
					considerations therefore it is plain that music has the power of producing a
					certain effect on the moral character of the soul, and if it has the power to do
					this, it is clear that the young must be directed to music and must be educated
					in it. <milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also education in music is
					well adapted to the youthful nature; for the young owing to their youth cannot
					endure any thing not sweetened by pleasure, and music is by nature a thing that
					has a pleasant sweetness. And we seem to have a certain affinity with tunes and
					rhythms; owing to which many wise men say either that the soul is a harmony or
					that it has harmony.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The former doctrine is
						Pythagorean, the latter is stated by <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 93">Plat. Phaedo

					to decide the question raised earlier, whether the young ought to learn music by
					singing and playing themselves or not. It is not difficult to see that it makes
					a great difference in the process of acquiring a certain quality whether one
					takes a part in the actions that impart it oneself; for it is a thing that is
					impossible, or difficult, to become a good judge of performances if one has not
					taken part in them. At the same time also boys must have some occupation, and
					one must think Archytas's rattle<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Archytas a
						Pythagorean philosopher, mathematician, statesman, and general of <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, contemporary with Plato. He was
						interested in mechanics; but one tradition ascribes the toy in question to a
						carpenter of the same name.</note> a good invention, which people give to
					children in order that while occupied with this they may not break any of the
					furniture; for young things cannot keep still. Whereas then a rattle is a
					suitable occupation for infant children, education serves as a rattle for young
					people when older. Such considerations therefore prove that children should be
					trained in music so as actually to take part in its performance; <milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and it is not difficult to distinguish what
					is suitable and unsuitable for various ages, and to refute those who assert that
					the practice of music is vulgar. For first, inasmuch as it is necessary to take
					part in the performances for the sake of judging them, it is therefore proper
					for the pupils when young actually to engage in the performances, though when
					they get older they should be released from performing, but be able to judge
					what is beautiful and enjoy it rightly because of the study in which they
					engaged in their youth. <milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then as to
					the objection raised by some people that music makes people vulgar, it is not
					difficult to solve it by considering how far pupils who are being educated with
					a view to civic virtue should take part in the actual performance of music,
						<milestone n="1341a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in what times and what rhythms they should take part, and
					also what kinds of instruments should be used in their studies, as this
					naturally makes a difference. For the solution of the objection depends upon
					these points, as it is quite possible that some modes of music do produce the
					result mentioned. <milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is manifest
					therefore that the study of music must not place a hindrance in the way of
					subsequent activities, nor vulgarize the bodily frame and make it useless for
					the exercises of the soldier and the citizen, either for their practical pursuit
					now or for their scientific study later on.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">It is difficult not to think that either the nouns or the adverbs in the
						Greek have been erroneously transposed, and that we should translate
						&lsquo;either for learning them now or for practising them later
						on.&rsquo;</note> And this would come about in respect of their study if
					the pupils did not go on toiling at the exercises that aim at professional
					competitions, nor the wonderful and elaborate performances which have now
					entered into the competitions and have passed from the competitions into
					education, but also only practised exercises not of that sort until they are
					able to enjoy beautiful tunes and rhythms, and not merely the charm common to
					all music, which even some lower animals enjoy, as well as a multitude of slaves
					and children. <milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is also clear
					from these considerations what sort of instruments they should use. Flutes must
					not be introduced into education, nor any other professional instrument, such as
					the harp or any other of that sort, but<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>such instruments as will make them attentive pupils either at their musical
					training or in their other lessons. Moreover the flute is not a moralizing but
					rather an exciting influence, so that it ought to be used for occasions of the
					kind at which attendance has the effect of purification rather than
						instruction.<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">See 1341a 33 ff.</note> And
					let us add that the flute happens to possess the additional property telling
					against its use in education that playing it prevents the employment of speech.
					Hence former ages rightly rejected its use by the young and the free, although
					at first they had employed it. <milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					as they came to have more leisure because of their wealth and grew more
					high-spirited and valorous, both at a still earlier date and because after the
					Persian Wars they were filled with pride as a result of their achievements, they
					began to engage in all branches of learning, making no distinction but pursuing
					research further. Because of this they even included flute-playing among their
					studies; for in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> a certain
					chorus-leader played the flute to his chorus himself,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A wealthy citizen who undertook the duty of equipping and
						training a chorus for a religious celebration &lpar;especially the

						referred to as existing at <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Sparta</placeName>.</note> and at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> it became so fashionable that almost the majority of

						is not elsewhere recorded. Who the flute-player was is unknown.</note>
					<milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But later on it came to be
					disapproved of as a result of actual experience, when men were more capable of
					judging what music conduced to virtue and what did not; and similarly also many
					of the old instruments were disapproved of, like the pectis and the

						of the lyre.</note> and the instruments designed to give pleasure to those
					who hear people playing them,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">A possible

					<milestone n="1341b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and all the instruments that require manual skill.<milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And indeed there is a reasonable foundation for the story
					that was told by the ancients about the flute. The tale goes that Athena found a
					flute and threw it away. Now it is not a bad point in the story that the goddess
					did this out of annoyance because of the ugly distortion of her features; but as
					a matter of fact it is more likely that it was because education in
					flute-playing has no effect on the intelligence, whereas we attribute science
					and art to Athena.<milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And since we reject professional education in the instruments
					and in performance<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">The Greek should probably
						be altered to give &lsquo;reject, some instruments and professional
						education in performance.&rsquo;</note> &lpar;and we count
					performance in competitions as professional, for the performer does not take
					part in it for his own improvement, but for his hearers' pleasure, and that a
					vulgar pleasure, owing to which we do not consider performing to be proper for
					free men, but somewhat menial; and indeed performers do become vulgar, since the
					object at which they aim is a low one, as vulgarity in the audience usually
					influences the music, so that it imparts to the artists who practise it with a
					view to suit the audience a special kind of personality, and also of bodily
					frame because of the movements required&rpar;&mdash;<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>we must therefore give some consideration to tunes
					and rhythms,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and to the question
					whether for educational purposes we must employ all the tunes and all the
					rhythms or make distinctions; and next, whether for those who are working at
					music for education we shall lay down the same regulation, or ought we to
					establish some other third one &lpar;inasmuch as we see that the factors in
					music are melody and rhythm, and it is important to notice what influence each
					of these has upon education&rpar;, and whether we are to prefer music with a
					good melody or music with a good rhythm. <milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now we consider that much is well said on these matters by
					some of the musicians of the present day and by some of those engaged in
					philosophy who happen to be experienced in musical education, and we will
					abandon the precise discussion as to each of these matters for any who wish it
					to seek it from those teachers, while for the present let us lay down general
					principles, merely stating the outlines of the subjects. <milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we accept the classification of melodies
					made by some philosophers, as ethical melodies, melodies of action, and
					passionate melodies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">i.e. representative of
						character, of action and of emotion.</note> distributing the various
					harmonies among these classes as being in nature akin to one or the other, and
					as we say that music ought to be employed not for the purpose of one benefit
					that it confers but on account of several &lpar;for it serves the purpose
					both of education and of purgation&mdash;the term purgation we use for the
					present without explanation, but we will return to discuss the meaning that we
					give to it more explicitly in our treatise on poetry<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">In <bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1449b">Aristot. Poet. 6</bibl>
						tragedy is said to purge the emotion of pity and fear by giving them an
						outlet; the reference here is probably to the lost Second Book of
							<title>Poetics</title>.</note>&mdash;and thirdly it serves for
					amusement, serving to relax our tension and to give rest from it&rpar;,
						<milestone n="1342a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>it is clear that we
					should employ all the harmonies, yet not employ them all in the same way, but
					use the most ethical ones for education, and the active and passionate kinds for
					listening to when others are performing &lpar;for any experience that occurs
					violently in some souls is found in all, though with different degrees of
					intensity&mdash;for example pity and fear, and also religious excitement;
					for some persons are very liable to this form of emotion, and under the
					influence of sacred music we see these people, when they use tunes that
					violently arouse the soul, being thrown into a state as if they had received
					medicinal treatment and taken a purge; <milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>the same experience then must come also to the
					compassionate and the timid and the other emotional people generally in such
					degree as befalls each individual of these classes, and all must undergo a
					purgation and a pleasant feeling of relief; and similarly also the purgative
					melodies afford harmless delight to people&rpar;. Therefore those who go in
					for theatrical music must be set to compete in harmonies and melodies of this
					kind <milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&lpar;and since the
					audience is of two classes, one freemen and educated people, and the
						other<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the vulgar class composed of
					mechanics and laborers and other such persons, the latter sort also must be
					assigned competitions and shows for relaxation; and just as their souls are
					warped from the natural state, so those harmonies and melodies that are highly
					strung and irregular in coloration<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Said to
						mean divergent from the regular scale in having smaller intervals.</note>
					are deviations, but people of each sort receive pleasure from what is naturally
					suited to them, owing to which the competitors before an audience of this sort
					must be allowed to employ some such kind of music as this&rpar;; <milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but for education, as has been said,<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1342a 2.</note> the ethical class of melodies
					and of harmonies must be employed. And of that nature is the Dorian mode, as we
					said before<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">1343b 3 ff.</note>; but we must
					also accept any other mode that those who take part in the pursuit of philosophy
					and in musical education may recommend to us. Socrates in the
						<title>Republic</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 399a">Plat. Rep. 399a</bibl>
					</note> does not do well in allowing only the Phrygian mode along with the
					Dorian, and that when he has rejected the flute among instruments; <milestone n="1342b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the
					Phrygian mode has the same effect among harmonies as the flute among
					instruments&mdash;both are violently exciting and emotional. <milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is shown by poetry; for all Bacchiac
					versification and all movement of that sort<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">Or perhaps <foreign lang="greek">bakxei/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign> denote bodily movement accompanying the
						song; or they may denote the emotional frenzy expressed and stimulated by
						it. The dithyramb was a form of poetry of this class, originally celebrating
						the birth of Dionysus. Philoxenus, one of the most famous dithyrambic poets,
							<dateRange from="-435" to="-380">435</dateRange>-380 B.C., lived at
							<placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, and later at the court
						of Dionysius of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.</note>
					belongs particularly to the flute among the instruments, and these meters find
					their suitable accompaniment in tunes in the Phrygian mode among the harmonies:
					for example the dithyramb is admittedly held to be a Phrygian meter, and the
					experts on this subject adduce many instances to prove this, particularly the
					fact that Philoxenus when he attempted to compose a dithyramb, <title>The
						Mysians</title>, in the Dorian mode
					was unable to do so, but merely by the force of nature fell back again into the
					suitable harmony, the Phrygian. <milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					all agree that the Dorian mode is more
					sedate and of a specially manly character. Moreover since we praise and say that
					we ought to pursue the mean between extremes, and the Dorian mode has this nature in relation to the
					other harmonies, it is clear that it suits the younger pupils to be educated
					rather in the Dorian melodies. But
					there are two objects to aim at, the possible as well as the suitable; for we
					are bound rather to attempt the things that are possible and those that are
					suitable for the particular class of people concerned;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in these matters also there are dividing lines
					drawn by the ages&mdash;for instance, those whose powers have waned through
					lapse of time cannot easily sing the highly strung harmonies, but to persons of
					that age nature suggests the relaxed harmonies. <milestone n="7.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore some musical experts also rightly criticize
						Socrates<note anchored="yes" resp="Rackham">
						<bibl n="Plat. Rep. 338e">Plat. Rep. 338e</bibl>
					</note> because he disapproved of the relaxed harmonies for amusement, taking
					them to have the character of intoxication, not in the sense of the effect of
					strong drink, for that clearly has more the result of making men frenzied
					revellers, but as failing in power. Hence even with a view to the period of life
					that is to follow, that of the comparatively old, it is proper to engage in the
					harmonies and melodies of this kind too, and also any kind of harmony that is
					suited to the age of boyhood because it is capable of being at once decorous and
					educative, which seems to be the nature of the Lydian mode most of all the
					harmonies. It is clear therefore that we should lay down these three canons to
					guide education, moderation, possibility and suitability.</p>
