					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					<p>There are some who say that the study of philosophy had its beginning among the barbarians.
						They urge that the Persians have had their Magi,
						the Babylonians or Assyrians their Chaldaeans, and
						the Indians their Gymnosophists; and among the
						Celts and Gauls there are the people called Druids
						or Holy Ones, for which they cite as authorities the
						<hi rend='ital'>Magicus</hi> of Aristotle and Sotion in the
						twenty-third<note n='a'>The alteration of the numeral from 23 to 13 is
							supported
							by what little we know of Sotion's work. It was from a similar source that Clement of Alexandria must have taken
							what we find in
							<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 71 concerning
							Chaldaeans, Druids,
							Magians, Gymnosophists, and other barbarian philosophers.</note>
						book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Succession of Philosophers.</hi> Also they
						say that Mochus was a Phoenician, Zamolxis a
						Thracian, and Atlas a Libyan.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					<p>If we may believe the Egyptians, Hephaestus was
						the son of the Nile, and with him philosophy began,
						priests and prophets being its chief exponents.
						Hephaestus lived 48,863 years before Alexander
						of Macedon, and in the interval there occurred 373
						solar and 832 lunar eclipses.</p>
					<pb n='5'/>
					<p>The date of the Magians, beginning with Zoroaster
						the Persian, was 5000 years before the fall of Troy,
						as given by Hermodorus the Platonist in his work
						on mathematics; but Xanthus the Lydian reckons
						6000 years from Zoroaster to the expedition of
						Xerxes, and after that event he places a long line
						of Magians in succession, bearing the names of
						Ostanas, Astrampsychos, Gobryas, and Pazatas,
						down to the conquest of Persia by Alexander.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<p>These authors forget that the achievements which
						they attribute to the barbarians belong to the
						Greeks, with whom not merely philosophy but the
						human race itself began. For instance, Musaeus is
						claimed by Athens, Linus by Thebes. It is said
						that the former, the son of Eumolpus, was the first
						to compose a genealogy of the gods and to construct
						a sphere, and that he maintained that all things
						proceed from unity and are resolved again into
						unity. He died at Phalerum, and this is his
						epitaph<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
							615.</note>:</p>
					<p>Musaeus, to his sire Eumolpus dear,</p>
					<p>In Phalerean soil lies buried here;</p>
					<p>and the Eumolpidae at Athens get their name from
					the father of Musaeus.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<p>Linus again was (so it is said) the son of Hermes
						and the Muse Urania. He composed a poem describing the creation of the world, the courses of the
						sun and moon, and the growth of animals and
						plants. His poem begins with the line:</p>
					<p>Time was when all things grew up at once;</p>
					<p>and this idea was borrowed by Anaxagoras when he
					<pb n='7'/>
					declared that all things were originally together
						until Mind came and set them in order. Linus died
						in Euboea, slain by the arrow of Apollo, and this is
						his epitaph<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
							616.</note>:</p>
					<p>Here Theban Linus, whom Urania bore,</p>
					<p>The fair-crowned Muse, sleeps on a foreign shore.</p>
					<p>And thus it was from the Greeks that philosophy
						took its rise: its very name refuses to be translated
						into foreign speech.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					<p>But those who attribute its invention to barbarians
						bring forward Orpheus the Thracian, calling him a
						philosopher of whose antiquity there can be no
						doubt. Now, considering the sort of things he said
						about the gods, I hardly know whether he ought to
						be called a philosopher; for what are we to make of
						one who does not scruple to charge the gods with
						all human suffering, and even the foul crimes wrought
						by the tongue amongst a few of mankind? The
						story goes that he met his death at the hands of
						women; but according to the epitaph at Dium in
						Macedonia he was slain by a thunderbolt; it runs
						as follows<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> ii.
							99.</note>:</p>
					<p>Here have the Muses laid their minstrel true,</p>
					<p>The Thracian Orpheus whom Jove's thunder slew.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<p>But the advocates of the theory that philosophy
						took its rise among the barbarians go on to explain
						the different forms it assumed in different countries.
						As to the Gymnosophists and Druids we are told
						that they uttered their philosophy in riddles, bidding
						men to reverence the gods, to abstain from wrongdoing, and to practise courage. That the Gymno-
					<pb n='9'/>
					sophists at all events despise even death itself is
						affirmed by Clitarchus in his twelfth book; he also
						says that the Chaldaeans apply themselves to
						astronomy and forecasting the future; while the
						Magi spend their time in the worship of the gods,
						in sacrifices and in prayers, implying that none but
						themselves have the ear of the gods. They propound their views concerning the being and origin
						of the gods, whom they hold to be fire, earth, and
						water; they condemn the use of images, and
						especially the error of attributing to the divinities
						difference of sex.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
						They hold discourse of justice,
						and deem it impious to practise cremation; but
						they see no impiety in marriage with a mother or
						daughter, as Sotion relates in his twenty-third book.
						Further, they practise divination and forecast the
						future, declaring that the gods appear to them in
						visible form. Moreover, they say that the air is
						full of shapes which stream forth like vapour and
						enter the eyes of keen-sighted seers. They prohibit
						personal ornament and the wearing of gold. Their
						dress is white, they make their bed on the ground,
						and their food is vegetables, cheese,<note n='a'>Compare Pliny,
							<hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xx. 11. 242: Zoroaster lived in
							the wilderness on cheese (<hi rend='ital'>cf. Yasht</hi>, xxii.
							18 "Spring butter is the ambrosia of the blessed"). For fuller
							comments on 7-9 see J. H. Moulton's
							<hi rend='ital'>Early
								Zoroastrianism</hi>, pp. 410-418.</note> and coarse
						bread; their staff is a reed and their custom is, so
						we are told, to stick it into the cheese and take up
						with it the part they eat.</p>
					<p>With the art of magic they were wholly unacquainted, according to Aristotle in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Magicus</hi>
						and Dinon in the fifth book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>History</hi> Dinon
						tells us that the name Zoroaster, literally interpreted,
						means "star-worshipper"<note n='b'>This popular etymology, though
							wide-spread, is
							erroneous, the true form of the prophet's name being
							Zarathustra, almost certainly derived from
							<hi
								rend='ital'>zarath</hi>="old"
							(a Zend stem, parallel to<foreign lang='greek'>ge/ront-</foreign>) and
							<hi rend='ital'>ustra</hi>="camel."
							<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> J. H. Moulton,
							<hi rend='ital'>op. cit.</hi>
							p. 426, and, for star-lore in the
							Avesta,
							<hi rend='ital'>ib.</hi> p. 210.</note>; and Hermodorus
						agrees
					<pb n='11'/>
					with him in this. 
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					Aristotle in the first book of his
						dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophy</hi> declares that the Magi are
						more ancient than the Egyptians; and further, that
						they believe in two principles, the good spirit and
						the evil spirit, the one called Zeus or Oromasdes,
						the other Hades or Arimanius. This is confirmed
						by Hermippus in his first book about the Magi,
						Eudoxus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Voyage round the World</hi>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Philippica.</hi> 
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
						The last-named author says that according to the Magi
						men will live in a future life and be immortal, and
						that the world will endure through their invocations.<note n='a'>In
							this clause the word
							<foreign lang='greek'>e)piklh/sesi</foreign> is
							usually taken as
							equivalent to
							<foreign lang='greek'>o)no/masi</foreign> (names). The
							meaning then would
							be: "What exists now will exist hereafter under its own
							present name." Diels would alter
							<foreign lang='greek'>e)piklh/sesi</foreign> to
							<foreign lang='greek'>periku-
								klh/sesi</foreign>, thus obtaining something very like the Heraclitean
							union of opposites: "the things which are will continue to
							be through all their revolutions." But
							<foreign lang='greek'>e)pi/klhsis</foreign> like
							<foreign lang='greek'>e)tikalei=sqai</foreign> can be used of prayer, and
							there is some
							evidence that Avestan religion fully recognized the efficacy
							of prayers and spells. The testimony of Theopompus, who
							wrote in the fourth century, to the Zoroastrian doctrine of
							immortality is regarded by J. H. Moulton as specially
							important:
							<hi rend='ital'>cf. Early Zoroastrianism</hi>, pp. 177
							<hi
								rend='ital'>sq.</hi> and 416.</note>
						This is again confirmed by Eudemus of Rhodes.
						But Hecataeus relates that according to them the
						gods are subject to birth. Clearchus of Soli in his
						tract
						<hi rend='ital'>On Education</hi> further makes the Gymnosophists
						to be descended from the Magi; and some trace
						the Jews also to the same origin. Furthermore,
						those who have written about the Magi criticize
						Herodotus. They urge that Xerxes would never
						have cast javelins at the sun nor have let down
						fetters into the sea, since in the creed of the Magi
						sun and sea are gods. But that statues of the
						gods should be destroyed by Xerxes was natural
						enough.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
					<p>The philosophy of the Egyptians is described as
						follows so far as relates to the gods and to justice.
						They say that matter was the first principle, next
						the four elements were derived from matter, and
						thus living things of every species were produced.</p>
					<pb n='13'/>
					<p>The sun and the moon are gods bearing the names of
						Osiris and Isis respectively; they make use of the
						beetle, the dragon, the hawk, and other creatures
						as symbols of divinity, according to Manetho in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Epitome of Physical Doctrines</hi>, and Hecataeus in
						the
						first book of his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Egyptian Philosophy.</hi>
						They also set up statues and temples to these sacred
						animals because they do not know the true form of
						the deity. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
						They hold that the universe is created
						and perishable, and that it is spherical in shape.
						They say that the stars consist of fire, and that,
						according as the fire in them is mixed, so events
						happen upon earth; that the moon is eclipsed when
						it falls into the earth's shadow; that the soul
						survives death and passes into other bodies; that
						rain is caused by change in the atmosphere; of all
						other phenomena they give physical explanations,
						as related by Hecataeus and Aristagoras. They
						also laid down laws on the subject of justice, which
						they ascribed to Hermes; and they deified those
						animals which are serviceable to man. They also
						claimed to have invented geometry, astronomy, and
						arithmetic. Thus much concerning the invention
						of philosophy.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
					<p>But the first to use the term, and to call himself
						a philosopher or lover of wisdom, was Pythagoras;<note n='a'>This is
							confirmed by Clement,
							<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 61, who also
							repeats (<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 24) the statement that
							<foreign lang='greek'>sofisth/s</foreign>=<foreign lang='greek'>sofo/s.</foreign></note>
						for, said he, no man is wise, but God alone. Heraclides of Pontus, in his
						<hi rend='ital'>De mortua</hi>, makes him say
						this at Sicyon in conversation with Leon, who was
						the prince of that city or of Phlius. All too quickly
						the study was called wisdom and its professor a
						sage, to denote his attainment of mental perfection;
						while the student who took it up was a philosopher
						or lover of wisdom. Sophists was another name for
					<pb n='15'/>
					the wise men, and not only for philosophers but for
						the poets also. And so Cratinus when praising
						Homer and Hesiod in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Archilochi</hi> gives them the
						title of sophist.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
					<p>The men who were commonly regarded as sages
						were the following: Thales, Solon, Periander,
						Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias, Pittacus. To these are
						added Anacharsis the Scythian, Myson of Chen,
						Pherecydes of Syros, Epimenides the Cretan; and
						by some even Pisistratus the tyrant. So much for
						the sages or wise men.<note n='a'>Compare Clem. Alex.
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 59. His authority
							includes another candidate for admission to the Seven,
							Acusilaus of Argos, but makes no mention of Pisistratus.</note></p>
					<p>But philosophy, the pursuit of wisdom, has had
						a twofold origin; it started with Anaximander on
						the one hand, with Pythagoras on the other. The
						former was a pupil of Thales, Pythagoras was taught
						by Pherecydes. The one school was called Ionian,
						because Thales, a Milesian and therefore an Ionian,
						instructed Anaximander; the other school was called
						Italian from Pythagoras, who worked for the most
						part in Italy. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
						And the one school, that of Ionia,
						terminates with Clitomachus and Chrysippus and
						Theophrastus, that of Italy with Epicurus. The
						succession passes from Thales through Anaximander,
						Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, to Socrates,
						who introduced ethics or moral philosophy; from
						Socrates to his pupils the Socratics, and especially
						to Plato, the founder of the Old Academy; from
						Plato, through Speusippus and Xenocrates, the
						succession passes to Polemo, Crantor, and Crates,
						Arcesilaus, founder of the Middle Academy, Lacydes,<note n='b'>See iv.
							59-61, where Lacydes is made the founder of
							the New Academy, although other authorities,
							<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
							Sext.
							Emp.
							<hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> i. 220. say the Third or New
							Academy
							began with Carneades. But the claim of Lacydes is supported by
							<hi rend='ital'>Ind. Acad.</hi> pp. 76. 37
							<hi
								rend='ital'>sq.</hi> Mekler, and the article
							<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi> in Suidas, which comes from
							Hesychius.</note>
					<pb n='17'/>
					founder of the New Academy, Carneades, and Clitomachus. This line brings us to Clitomachus.</p>
					<p>
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
						There is another which ends with Chrysippus,
						that is to say by passing from Socrates to Antisthenes,
						then to Diogenes the Cynic, Crates of Thebes, Zeno
						of Citium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus. And yet again
						another ends with Theophrastus; thus from Plato
						it passes to Aristotle, and from Aristotle to Theophrastus. 
						In this manner the school of Ionia comes
						to an end.</p>
					<p>In the Italian school the order of succession is as
						follows: first Pherecydes, next Pythagoras, next
						his son Telauges, then Xenophanes, Parmenides,<note n='a'>This
							succession (Pythagoras, Telauges, Xenophanes,
							Parmenides) does not exactly agree with what is said in
							the lives of Xenophanes and Parmenides, ix. 18, 21, where
							Parmenides, not Xenophanes, is made a pupil of the Pythagoreans. 
							The arrangement followed in i. 12-15 treats the
							Italian school as a true succession, whereas in Book IX.
							many of them are regarded as sporadic thinkers, according
							to the view expressed in viii. 91.</note>
						Zeno of Elea, Leucippus, Democritus, who had
						many pupils, in particular Nausiphanes [and Naucydes], who were teachers of Epicurus.</p>
					<p>
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
						Philosophers may be divided into dogmatists and
						sceptics: all those who make assertions about
						things assuming that they can be known are
						dogmatists; while all who suspend their judgement
						on the ground that things are unknowable are
						sceptics. Again, some philosophers left writings
						behind them, while others wrote nothing at all, as
						was the case according to some authorities with
						Socrates, Stilpo, Philippus, Menedemus, Pyrrho,
						Theodorus, Carneades, Bryson; some add Pythagoras and Aristo of Chios, except that they wrote a
						few letters. Others wrote no more than one treatise
						each, as Melissus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras. Many
						works were written by Zeno, more by Xenophanes,
						more by Democritus, more by Aristotle, more by
						Epicurus, and still more by Chrysippus.</p>
					<pb n='19'/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<p>Some schools took their name from cities, as the
						Elians and the Megarians, the Eretrians and the
						Cyrenaics; others from localities, as the Academics
						and the Stoics; others from incidental circumstances,
						as the Peripatetics; others again from derisive nicknames, as the Cynics; others from their temperaments, as the Eudaemonists or Happiness School;
						others from a conceit they entertained, as Truthlovers, Refutationists, and Reasoners from Analogy;
						others again from their teachers, as Socratics,
						Epicureans, and the like; some take the name of
						Physicists from their investigation of nature, others
						that of Moralists because they discuss morals;
						while those who are occupied with verbal jugglery
						are styled Dialecticians.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
					<p>Philosophy has three parts, physics, ethics, and
						dialectic or logic. Physics is the part concerned
						with the universe and all that it contains; ethics
						that concerned with life and all that has to do with
						us; while the processes of reasoning employed
						by both form the province of dialectic. Physics
						flourished down to the time of Archelaus; ethics,
						as we have said, started with Socrates; while
						dialectic goes as far back as Zeno of Elea. In ethics
						there have been ten schools: the Academic, the
						Cyrenaic, the Elian, the Megarian, the Cynic, the
						Eretrian, the Dialectic, the Peripatetic, the Stoic,
						and the Epicurean.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
					<p>The founders of these schools were: of the Old
						Academy, Plato; of the Middle Academy, Arcesilaus;
						of the New Academy, Lacydes; of the Cyrenaic,
						Aristippus of Cyrene; of the Elian, Phaedo of Elis;
						of the Megarian, Euclides of Megara; of the Cynic,
						Antisthenes of Athens; of the Eretrian, Menedemus
					<pb n='21'/>
					of Eretria; of the Dialectical school, Clitomachus of
						Carthage; of the Peripatetic, Aristotle of Stagira;
						of the Stoic, Zeno of Citium; while the Epicurean
						school took its name from Epicurus himself.</p>
					<p>Hippobotus in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophical Sects</hi>
						declares that there are nine sects or schools, and
						gives them in this order: (1) Megarian, (2) Eretrian,
						(3) Cyrenaic, (4) Epicurean, (5) Annicerean,<note n='a'>The separation
							of the followers of Anniceris from the
							Cyrenaic school was made by the author whom Clement of
							Alexandria followed in ii. 130. This author may have been
							Antiochus of Ascalon. Strabo x. 837
							<hi rend='ital'>s.f.</hi> supports
							the
							same view:
							<foreign lang='greek'>*)anni/keris o( dokw=n e)panorqw=sai th\n *kurhnai+kh\n ai(/resin, kai\ paragagei=n a)nt' au)th=s th\n *)annikerei/an.</foreign></note>,
						(6)
						Theodorean, (7) Zenonian or Stoic, (8) Old Academic,
						(9) Peripatetic. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
						He passes over the Cynic, Elian,
						and Dialectical schools; for as to the Pyrrhonians,
						so indefinite are their conclusions that hardly any
						authorities allow them to be a sect; some allow
						their claim in certain respects, but not in others.
						It would seem, however, that they are a sect, for
						we use the term of those who in their attitude to
						appearance follow or seem to follow some principle;
						and on this ground we should be justified in calling
						the Sceptics a sect. But if we are to understand
						by "sect" a bias in favour of coherent positive
						doctrines, they could no longer be called a sect,<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> the distinction drawn by Sextus Empiricus in
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Pyrrh.
								Hyp.</hi> i. 16, 17. If by rules for conduct dogmas are implied,
							then the Pyrrhonians are not a sect,
							<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> a
							dogmatic school.</note>,
						for they have no positive doctrines. So much for
						the beginnings of philosophy, its subsequent developments, its various parts, and the number of the
						philosophic sects.</p>
					<p>
						<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
						One word more: not long ago an Eclectic school
						was introduced by Potamo of Alexandria,<note n='c'>Certainly not the
							same as the person mentioned by
							Porphyry in his
							<hi rend='ital'>Life of Plotinus,</hi> 9, 11, for
							Polemo, not
							Potamo, is the correct form of the name in that place.
							Potamo is said by Suidas (<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi>
							<foreign lang='greek'>*hota/mwn *)al.</foreign>) to have lived
							shortly before and contemporary with Augustus, whence
							it follows that Diogenes has taken without alteration a
							statement by an earlier writer who might truthfully say
							"not long ago" of the reign of Augustus. Suidas, whose
							article
							<foreign lang='greek'>ai(/resis</foreign> agrees closely with our
							text, naturally omits
							<foreign lang='greek'>pro\ o)li/gou.</foreign></note>, who
					<pb n='23'/>
					made a selection from the tenets of all the existing
						sects. As he himself states in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Elements of
							Philosophy,</hi> he takes as criteria of truth (1) that
						by which the judgement is formed, namely, the
						ruling principle of the soul; (2) the instrument
						used, for instance the most accurate perception.
						His universal principles are matter and the efficient
						cause, quality, and place; for that out of which
						and that by which a thing is made, as well as the
						quality with which and the place in which it is
						made, are principles. The end to which he refers
						all actions is life made perfect in all virtue, natural
						advantages of body and environment being indispensable to its attainment.</p>
					<p>It remains to speak of the philosophers themselves,
						and in the first place of Thales.</p>

						Herodotus, Duris, and Democritus are agreed
						that Thales was the son of Examyas and Cleobulina,
						and belonged to the Thelidae<note n='a'>Nelidac, if Bywater's
							emendation is correct.</note> who are Phoenicians,
						and among the noblest of the descendants of Cadmus
						and Agenor. As Plato testifies, he was one of the
						Seven Sages. He was the first to receive the name
						of Sage, in the archonship of Damasias<note n='b'>582 b.c.</note> at
						Athens,
						when the term was applied to all the Seven Sages,
						as Demetrius of Phalerum mentions in his
						<hi rend='ital'>List of
							Archons.</hi> He was admitted to citizenship at Miletus
						when he came to that town along with Nileos, who
						had been expelled from Phoenicia. Most writers,
						however, represent him as a genuine Milesian and
						of a distinguished family.</p>

						<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
						After engaging in politics he became a student
						of nature. According to some he left nothing in
						writing; for the
						<hi rend='ital'>Nautical Astronomy</hi><note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Simplicius,
							<hi rend='ital'>In Phys.</hi> i. 23,
							29-33 d.</note> attributed to
						him is said to be by Phocus of Samos. Callimachus
						knows him as the discoverer of the Ursa Minor;
						for he says in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Iambics</hi>:</p>
					<p>Who first of men the course made plain</p>
					<p>Of those small stars we call the Wain,</p>
					<p>Whereby Phoenicians sail the main.<note n='b'>Greek mariners steered
						by the Great Bear, the Phoenicians
						by the Little Bear, as Ovid states,
						<hi rend='ital'>Tristia,</hi> iv.

					<p>But according to others he wrote nothing but two
						treatises, one
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Solstice</hi> and one
						<hi
							rend='ital'>On the Equinox,</hi>
						regarding all other matters as incognizable. He
						seems by some accounts to have been the first to
						study astronomy,<note n='c'>See Sir T. L. Heath,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Aristarchus of Samos</hi>, pp. 12-23.</note>, the first to
						predict eclipses of the
						sun and to fix the solstices; so Eudemus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>History of Astronomy.</hi> It was this which gained for
						him the admiration of Xenophanes and Herodotus
						and the notice of Heraclitus and Democritus.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
					<p>And some, including Choerilus the poet, declare
						that he was the first to maintain the immortality
						of the soul. He was the first to determine the sun's
						course from solstice to solstice, and according to
						some the first to declare the size of the sun to be
						one seven hundred and twentieth part of the solar
						circle, and the size of the moon to be the same
						fraction of the lunar circle. He was the first to give
						the last day of the month the name of Thirtieth, and
						the first, some say, to discuss physical problems.</p>
					<p>Aristotle<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>De anima,</hi> A 2, 405 a
						19.</note> and Hippias affirm that, arguing from
						the magnet and from amber, he attributed a soul or
						life even to inanimate objects. Pamphila states that,
					<pb n='27'/>
					having learnt geometry from the Egyptians, he was
						the first to inscribe a right-angled triangle in a circle,
						whereupon he sacrificed an ox. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
						Others tell this tale
						of Pythagoras, amongst them Apollodorus the arithmetician. (It was Pythagoras who developed to
						their furthest extent the discoveries attributed by
						Callimachus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Iambics</hi> to Euphorbus the
						Phrygian, I mean "scalene triangles" and whatever
						else has to do with theoretical geometry.<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> a theory concerned with lines,
							<foreign lang='greek'>grammai/,</foreign> which of
							course include curves as well as straight lines.</note>)</p>
					<p>Thales is also credited with having given excellent
						advice on political matters. For instance, when
						Croesus sent to Miletus offering terms of alliance,
						he frustrated the plan; and this proved the salvation
						of the city when Cyrus obtained the victory. Heraclides makes Thales himself<note n='b'>Namely, in a dialogue.
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> viii. 4.</note> say that he had always
						lived in solitude as a private individual and kept
						aloof from State affairs. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
						Some authorities say that
						he married and had a son Cybisthus; others that
						he remained unmarried and adopted his sister's son,
						and that when he was asked why he had no children
						of his own he replied "because he loved children."
						The story is told that, when his mother tried to
						force him to marry, he replied it was too soon, and
						when she pressed him again later in life, he replied
						that it was too late. Hieronymus of Rhodes in the
						second book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Scattered Notes</hi> relates that,
						in
						order to show how easy it is to grow rich, Thales,
						foreseeing that it would be a good season for olives,
						rented all the oil-mills and thus amassed a fortune.<note
							n='c'>Because, having created a monopoly, he could charge
							what he pleased. See Aristotle's version of the story,

						His doctrine was that water is the universal
						primary substance, and that the world is animate
						and full of divinities. He is said to have discovered
					<pb n='29'/>
					the seasons of the year and divided it into 365
						days.</p>
					<p>He had no instructor, except that he went to
						Egypt and spent some time with the priests there.
						Hieronymus informs us that he measured the height
						of the pyramids by the shadow they cast, taking the
						observation at the hour when our shadow is of the
						same length as ourselves. He lived, as Minyas
						relates, with Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Miletus.</p>
					<p>The well-known story of the tripod found by the
						fishermen and sent by the people of Miletus to all
						the Wise Men in succession runs as follows. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
						Certain
						Ionian youths having purchased of the Milesian
						fishermen their catch of fish, a dispute arose over
						the tripod which had formed part of the catch.
						Finally the Milesians referred the question to
						Delphi, and the god gave an oracle in this form<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vi. 51.</note>:</p>
					<p>Who shall possess the tripod? Thus replies</p>
					<p>Apollo: "Whosoever is most wise."<note n='b'>Or in prose: "Offspring
						of Miletus, do you ask Phoebus
						concerning the tripod? Whoso in wisdom is of all the first,
						to him the tripod I adjudge."</note></p>
					<p>Accordingly they give it to Thales, and he to
						another, and so on till it comes to Solon, who, with
						the remark that the god was the most wise, sent it
						off to Delphi. Callimachus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Iambics</hi> has a
						different version of the story, which he took from
						Maeandrius of Miletus.<note n='c'>Although disguised as Leandrius, the
							writer meant is
							Maeandrius, who is known (<hi rend='ital'>Inscr. Gr.</hi> no. 2905) to
							have
							written a local history of Miletus. Such histories,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>etg.</hi> of
							Sicyon, Megara, Samos, Naxos, Argolis, Epirus, Thessaly,
							abounded in the Alexandrian age.</note> It is that Bathycles, an
						Arcadian, left at his death a bowl with the solemn
						injunction that it "should be given to him who
						had done most good by his wisdom." So it was
						given to Thales, went the round of all the sages,
						and came back to Thales again. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
						And he sent it
					<pb n='31'/>
					to Apollo at Didyma, with this dedication, according
						to Callimachus:</p>
					<p>Lord of the folk of Neleus' line,</p>
					<p>Thales, of Greeks adjudged most wise,</p>
					<p>Brings to thy Didymaean shrine</p>
					<p>His offering, a twice-won prize.</p>
					<p>But the prose inscription is:</p>
					<p>Thales the Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this]
						to Delphinian Apollo after twice winning the prize from
						all the Greeks.</p>
					<p>The bowl was carried from place to place by the
						son of Bathycles, whose name was Thyrion, so it is
						stated by Eleusis in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Achilles,</hi> and
						Alexo
						the Myndian in the ninth book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Legends.</hi></p>
					<p>But Eudoxus of Cnidos and Euanthes of Miletus
						agree that a certain man who was a friend of Croesus
						received from the king a golden goblet in order to
						bestow it upon the wisest of the Greeks; this man
						gave it to Thales, and from him it passed to others
						and so to Chilon.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
					<p>Chilon laid the question "Who is a wiser man
						than I?" before the Pythian Apollo, and the god
						replied "Myson." Of him we shall have more to
						say presently. (In the list of the Seven Sages
						given by Eudoxus, Myson takes the place of Cleobulus; Plato also includes him by omitting Periander.) The answer of the oracle respecting him
						was as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vi.
							40.</note>:</p>
					<p>Myson of Chen in Oeta; this is he</p>
					<p>Who for wiseheartedness surpasseth thee;</p>
					<p>and it was given in reply to a question put by
						Anacharsis. Daimachus the Platonist and Clearchus
						allege that a bowl was sent by Croesus to Pittacus
						and began the round of the Wise Men from him.</p>
					<pb n='33'/>
					<p>The story told by Andron<note n='a'>Andron of Ephesus (&sect;119) is known
						to have written in the life-time (or at least before the death) of
						Theopompus,
						who is accused of having plagiarized from
						<hi rend='ital'>The
							Tripod:</hi>
						Eusebius,
						<hi rend='ital'>Praep. Ev.</hi> x. 3, 7.</note> in his work
						on
						<hi rend='ital'>The Tripod</hi> is that the Argives offered a tripod as
						a prize
						of virtue to the wisest of the Greeks; Aristodemus
						of Sparta was adjudged the winner but retired in
						favour of Chilon. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
						Aristodemus is mentioned by
						Alcaeus thus<note n='b'>Fr. 49 Bergk;
							<hi rend='ital'>cf. Schol.</hi>
							Pindar,
							<hi rend='ital'>Isthm.</hi> ii. 17.</note>:</p>
					<p>Surely no witless word was this of the Spartan, I deem,</p>
					<p>"Wealth is the worth of a man; and poverty void of
						esteem."</p>
					<p>Some relate that a vessel with its freight was sent
						by Periander to Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus,
						and that, when it was wrecked in Coan waters, the
						tripod was afterwards found by certain fishermen.
						However, Phanodicus declares it to have been found
						in Athenian waters and thence brought to Athens.
						An assembly was held and it was sent to Bias; 
						<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
						for
						what reason shall be explained in the life of Bias.</p>
					<p>There is yet another version, that it was the work
						of Hephaestus presented by the god to Pelops on
						his marriage. Thence it passed to Menelaus and
						was carried off by Paris along with Helen and was
						thrown by her into the Coan sea, for she said it
						would be a cause of strife. In process of time
						certain people of Lebedus, having purchased a catch
						of fish thereabouts, obtained possession of the tripod,
						and, quarrelling with the fishermen about it, put in
						to Cos, and, when they could not settle the dispute,
						reported the fact to Miletus, their mother-city.
						The Milesians, when their embassies were disregarded, made war upon Cos; many fell on both
						sides, and an oracle pronounced that the tripod
					<pb n='35'/>
					should be given to the wisest; both parties to the
						dispute agreed upon Thales. After it had gone the
						round of the sages, Thales dedicated it to Apollo
						of Didyma. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
						The oracle which the Coans received
						was on this wise:</p>
					<p>Hephaestus cast the tripod in the sea;</p>
					<p>Until it quit the city there will be</p>
					<p>No end to strife, until it reach the seer</p>
					<p>Whose wisdom makes past, present, future clear.</p>
					<p>That of the Milesians beginning "Who shall possess
						the tripod?" has been quoted above. So much for
						this version of the story.</p>
					<p>Hermippus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> refers to Thales the
						story
						which is told by some of Socrates, namely, that he
						used to say there were three blessings for which
						he was grateful to Fortune: "first, that I was
						born a human being and not one of the brutes;
						next, that I was born a man and not a woman;
						thirdly, a Greek and not a barbarian." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
						It is said
						that once, when he was taken out of doors by an old
						woman in order that he might observe the stars, he
						fell into a ditch, and his cry for help drew from the
						old woman the retort, "How can you expect to
						know all about the heavens, Thales, when you cannot
						even see what is just before your feet?" Timon too
						knows him as an astronomer, and praises him in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi> where he says<note n='a'>Fr. 23
							Diels.</note>:</p>
					<p>Thales among the Seven the sage astronomer.</p>
					<p>His writings are said by Lobon of Argos to have
						run to some two hundred lines. His statue is said
						to bear this inscription<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi>

					<pb n='37'/>
					<p>Pride of Miletus and Ionian lands,</p>
					<p>Wisest astronomer, here Thales stands.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
					<p>Of songs still sung these verses belong to him:</p>
					<p>Many words do not declare an understanding heart.</p>
					<p>Seek one sole wisdom.</p>
					<p>Choose one sole good.</p>
					<p>For thou wilt check the tongues of chatterers prating
						without end.</p>
					<p>Here too are certain current apophthegms assigned
						to him:</p>
					<p>Of all things that are, the most ancient is God, for he is
						uncreated.</p>
					<p>The most beautiful is the universe, for it is God's workmanship.</p>
					<p>The greatest is space, for it holds all things.</p>
					<p>The swiftest is mind, for it speeds everywhere.</p>
					<p>The strongest, necessity, for it masters all.</p>
					<p>The wisest, time, for it brings everything to light.</p>
					<p>He held there was no difference between life and
						death. "Why then," said one, "do you not die?"
						"Because," said he, "there is no difference." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
						To the question which is older, day or night, he
						replied: "Night is the older by one day." Some
						one asked him whether a man could hide an evil
						deed from the gods: "No," he replied, "nor yet
						an evil thought." To the adulterer who inquired if
						he should deny the charge upon oath he replied that
						perjury was no worse than adultery. Being asked
						what is difficult, he replied, "To know oneself."
						"What is easy?" "To give advice to another."
						"What is most pleasant?" "Success." "What
						is the divine?" "That which has neither beginning
						nor end." To the question what was the strangest
					<pb n='39'/>
					thing he had ever seen, his answer was, "An aged
						tyrant." "How can one best bear adversity?"
						"If he should see his enemies in worse plight."
						"How shall we lead the best and most righteous
						life?" "By refraining from doing what we blame
						in others." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
						"What man is happy?" "He who
						has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile
						nature." He tells us to remember friends, whether
						present or absent; not to pride ourselves upon
						outward appearance, but to study to be beautiful
						in character. "Shun ill-gotten gains," he says.
						"Let not idle words prejudice thee against those
						who have shared thy confidence." "Whatever
						provision thou hast made for thy parents, the same
						must thou expect from thy children." He explained
						the overflow of the Nile as due to the etesian winds
						which, blowing in the contrary direction, drove the
						waters upstream.</p>
					<p>Apollodorus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> places his birth
						in
						the first year of the 35th Olympiad [640 b.c.]. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
						He died at the age of 78 (or, according to Sosicrates, of
						90 years); for he died in the 58th Olympiad, being
						contemporary with Croesus, whom he undertook to
						take across the Halys without building a bridge, by
						diverting the river.</p>
					<p>There have lived five other men who bore the
						name of Thales, as enumerated by Demetrius of
						Magnesia in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Dictionary of Men of the Same

					<p>1. A rhetorician of Callatia, with an affected style.</p>
					<p>2. A painter of Sicyon, of great gifts.</p>

					<p>4. A person mentioned by Duris in his work

					<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
					<p>Thales the Sage died as he was watching an athletic
						contest from heat, thirst, and the weakness incident
						to advanced age. And the inscription on his tomb
						is<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 84.</note>:</p>
					<p>Here in a narrow tomb great Thales lies;</p>
					<p>Yet his renown for wisdom reached the skies.</p>
					<p>I may also cite one of my own, from my first book,
						<hi rend='ital'>Epigrams in Various Metres</hi><note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 85.</note>:</p>
					<p>As Thales watched the games one festal day</p>
					<p>The fierce sun smote him, and he passed away;</p>
					<p>Zeus, thou didst well to raise him; his dim eyes</p>
					<p>Could not from earth behold the starry skies.<note n='c'>In plain

					<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
					<p>To him belongs the proverb "Know thyself,"
						which Antisthenes in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
							Philosophers</hi>
						attributes to Phemono&euml;, though admitting that it
						was appropriated by Chilon.</p>
					<p>This seems the proper place for a general notice of
						the Seven Sages, of whom we have such accounts
						as the following. Damon of Cyrene in his
						<hi rend='ital'>History
							of the Philosophers</hi> carps at all sages, but especially
						the Seven. Anaximenes remarks that they all
						applied themselves to poetry; Dicaearchus that
						they were neither sages nor philosophers, but merely
					<pb n='43'/>
					shrewd men with a turn for legislation.<note n='a'>The opinion of
						Dicaearchus thus expressed is correct.
						With the exception of Thales, no one whose life is contained
						in Book I. has any claim to be styled a philosopher. The
						tradition of the Seven Wise Men and of their meeting at
						some court, whether of a native tyrant like Periander
						or of a foreign prince like Croesus, was used by Plato
						(<hi rend='ital'>Protag.</hi> 343 A) and, largely through his influence,
						grew into
						a romantic legend, the result being late biographies, collections of apophthegms, and letters attributed to various
						authors,
						<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the apophthegms of Demetrius of
						Phalerum.
						Diogenes Laertius swallows all this as true; modern criticism
						rejects it all as forgery.</note> Archetimus
						of Syracuse describes their meeting at the court of
						Cypselus, on which occasion he himself happened to
						be present; for which Ephorus substitutes a meeting
						without Thales at the court of Croesus. Some make
						them meet at the Pan-Ionian festival, at Corinth,
						and at Delphi. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
						Their utterances are variously reported, and are attributed now to one now to the
						other, for instance the following<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
							Plan.</hi> iv. 22.</note>:</p>
					<p>Chilon of Lacedaemon's words are true:</p>
					<p>Nothing too much; good comes from measure due.</p>
					<p>Nor is there any agreement how the number is made
						up; for Maeandrius, in place of Cleobulus and Myson,
						includes Leophantus, son of Gorgiadas, of Lebedus
						or Ephesus, and Epimenides the Cretan in the list;
						Plato in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Protagoras</hi> admits Myson and leaves
						out Periander; Ephorus substitutes Anacharsis
						for Myson; others add Pythagoras to the Seven.
						Dicaearchus hands down four names fully recognized:
						Thales, Bias, Pittacus and Solon; and appends the
						names of six others, from whom he selects three:
						Aristodemus, Pamphylus, Chilon the Lacedaemonian,
						Cleobulus, Anacharsis, Periander. Others add Acusilaus, son of Cabas or Scabras, of Argos. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
						Hermippus
						in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Sages</hi> reckons seventeen, from

					charsis, Acusilaus, Epimenides, Leophantus, Pherecydes, Aristodemus, Pythagoras, Lasos, son of

					<head>Chapter 2. SOLON (archon 594 B.C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
					<p>Solon, the son of Execestides, was born at Salamis.
						His first achievement was the
						<foreign lang='greek'>seisa/xqeia</foreign> or Law of
						Release, which he introduced at Athens; its effect
						was to ransom persons and property. For men used
						to borrow money on personal security, and many
						were forced from poverty to become serfs or daylabourers. He then first renounced his claim to a
						debt of seven talents due to his father, and encouraged others to follow his example. This law of
						his was called
						<foreign lang='greek'>seisa/xqeia,</foreign> and the
						reason is obvious.</p>
					<p>He next went on to frame the rest of his laws,
						which would take time to enumerate, and inscribed
						them on the revolving pillars.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
					<p>His greatest service was this: Megara and Athens
						laid rival claims to his birthplace Salamis, and after
						many defeats the Athenians passed a decree punishing with death any man who should propose a renewal of the Salaminian war. Solon, feigning madness, rushed into the Agora with a garland on his
						head; there he had his poem on Salamis read to
					<pb n='49'/>
					the Athenians by the herald and roused them to
						fury. They renewed the war with the Megarians
						and, thanks to Solon, were victorious. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>
						These were
						the lines which did more than anything else to
						inflame the Athenians<note n='a'>Fr. 2 Bergk.</note>:</p>

					<p>Far in the Sporades! For men shall smile</p>

					<p>Then let us fight for Salamis and fair fame,</p>
					<p>Win the beloved isle, and purge our shame!</p>
					<p>He also persuaded the Athenians to acquire the
						Thracian Chersonese. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
						And lest it should be thought
						that he had acquired Salamis by force only and not

						further, that the tombs themselves faced the east,<note n='c'>If these

					<p>Ajax twelve ships from Salamis commands,</p>
					<p>Solon inserted one of his own:</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
					<p>Thereafter the people looked up to him, and
					<pb n='51'/>
					would gladly have had him rule them as tyrant; he
						refused, and, early perceiving the designs of his
						kinsman Pisistratus (so we are told by Sosicrates),
						did his best to hinder them. He rushed into the
						Assembly armed with spear and shield, warned them
						of the designs of Pisistratus, and not only so, but
						declared his willingness to render assistance, in these
						words: "Men of Athens, I am wiser than some of
						you and more courageous than others: wiser than
						those who fail to understand the plot of Pisistratus,
						more courageous than those who, though they see
						through it, keep silence through fear." And the
						members of the council, who were of Pisistratus'
						party, declared that he was mad: which made him
						say the lines<note n='a'>Fr. 10 Bergk.</note>:</p>
					<p>A little while, and the event will show</p>
					<p>To all the world if I be mad or no.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
					<p>That he foresaw the tyranny of Pisistratus is proved
						by a passage from a poem of his<note n='b'>Fr. 9 Bergk.</note>:</p>
					<p>On splendid lightning thunder follows straight,</p>
					<p>Clouds the soft snow and flashing hail-stones bring;</p>
					<p>So from proud men comes ruin, and their state</p>
					<p>Falls unaware to slavery and a king.</p>
					<p>When Pisistratus was already established, Solon,
						unable to move the people, piled his arms in front
						of the generals' quarters, and exclaimed, "My
						country, I have served thee with my word and
						sword!" Thereupon he sailed to Egypt and to
						Cyprus, and thence proceeded to the court of Croesus.
						There Croesus put the question, "Whom do you
						consider happy?" and Solon replied, "Tellus of
						Athens, and Cleobis and Biton," and went on in
						words too familiar to be quoted here.</p>
					<pb n='53'/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
					<p>There is a story that Croesus in magnificent array
						sat himself down on his throne and asked Solon if
						he had ever seen anything more beautiful. "Yes,"
						was the reply, "cocks and pheasants and peacocks;
						for they shine in nature's colours, which are ten
						thousand times more beautiful." After leaving that
						place he lived in Cilicia and founded a city which he
						called Soli after his own name. In it he settled
						some few Athenians, who in process of time corrupted
						the purity of Attic and were said to "solecize."
						Note that the people of this town are called Solenses,
						the people of Soli in Cyprus Solii. When he learnt
						that Pisistratus was by this time tyrant, he wrote to
						the Athenians on this wise<note n='a'>Fr. 11 Bergk.</note>:</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
					<p>If ye have suffered sadly through your own wickedness,
						lay not the blame for this upon the gods. For it is you
						yourselves who gave pledges to your foes and made them
						great; this is why you bear the brand of slavery. Every
						one of you treadeth in the footsteps of the fox, yet in the
						mass ye have little sense. Ye look to the speech and fair
						words of a flatterer, paying no regard to any practical
						result.</p>
					<p>Thus Solon. After he had gone into exile Pisistratus
						wrote to him as follows:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Pisistratus to Solon</hi></hi></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
					<p>"I am not the only man who has aimed at a tyranny
						in Greece, nor am I, a descendant of Codrus, unfitted
						for the part. That is, I resume the privileges which
						the Athenians swore to confer upon Codrus and his
						family, although later they took them away. In
						everything else I commit no offence against God or
						man; but I leave to the Athenians the management
					<pb n='55'/>
					of their affairs according to the ordinances established
						by you. And they are better governed than they
						would be under a democracy; for I allow no one to
						extend his rights, and though I am tyrant I arrogate
						to myself no undue share of reputation and honour,
						but merely such stated privileges as belonged to the
						kings in former times. Every citizen pays a tithe
						of his property, not to me but to a fund for defraying
						the cost of the public sacrifices or any other charges
						on the State or the expenditure on any war which
						may come upon us.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
					<p>"I do not blame you for disclosing my designs;
						you acted from loyalty to the city, not through any
						enmity to me, and further, in ignorance of the sort
						of rule which I was going to establish; since, if you
						had known, you would perhaps have tolerated me
						and not gone into exile. Wherefore return home,
						trusting my word, though it be not sworn, that Solon
						will suffer no harm from Pisistratus. For neither
						has any other enemy of mine suffered; of that you
						may be sure. And if you choose to become one of
						my friends, you will rank with the foremost, for I
						see no trace of treachery in you, nothing to excite
						mistrust; or if you wish to live at Athens on other
						terms, you have my permission. But do not on my
						account sever yourself from your country.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
					<p>So far Pisistratus. To return to Solon: one of his
						sayings is that 70 years are the term of man's life.</p>
					<p>He seems to have enacted some admirable laws;
						for instance, if any man neglects to provide for his
						parents, he shall be disfranchised; moreover there
						is a similar penalty for the spendthrift who runs
						through his patrimony. Again, not to have a settled
					<pb n='57'/>
					occupation is made a crime for which any one may,
						if he pleases, impeach the offender. Lysias, however,
						in his speech against Nicias ascribes this law to Draco,
						and to Solon another depriving open profligates of
						the right to speak in the Assembly. He curtailed
						the honours of athletes who took part in the games,
						fixing the allowance for an Olympic victor at 500
						drachmae, for an Isthmian victor at 100 drachmae,
						and proportionately in all other cases. It was in
						bad taste, he urged, to increase the rewards of these
						victors, and to ignore the exclusive claims of those
						who had fallen in battle, whose sons ought, moreover,
						to be maintained and educated by the State.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
					<p>The effect of this was that many strove to acquit
						themselves as gallant soldiers in battle, like Polyzelus,
						Cynegirus, Callimachus and all who fought at Marathon; or again like Harmodius and Aristogiton, and
						Miltiades and thousands more. Athletes, on the
						other hand, incur heavy costs while in training, do
						harm when successful, and are crowned for a victory
						over their country rather than over their rivals, and
						when they grow old they, in the words of Euripides,<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Autolycus,</hi> Fr. 1, 1. 12 Nauck,
							<hi

					<p><hi rend='center'>Are worn threadbare, cloaks that have lost the

					<p>and Solon, perceiving this, treated them with scant
						respect.<note n='b'>This censure of athletes recurs Diod. Sic. ix. 2. 3
							f. It
							was probably a commonplace
							<foreign lang='greek'>kefa/laion</foreign> in
							some earlier life
							of Solon.</note> Excellent, too, is his provision that the
						guardian of an orphan should not marry the mother
						of his ward, and that the next heir who would succeed
						on the death of the orphans should be disqualified
						from acting as their guardian. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
						Furthermore, that
						no engraver of seals should be allowed to retain an
						impression of the ring which he has sold, and that
						the penalty for depriving a one-eyed man of his
						single eye should be the loss of the offender's two
						eyes. A deposit shall not be removed except by the
					<pb n='59'/>
					depositor himself, on pain of death. That the magistrate found intoxicated should be punished with death.</p>
					<p>He has provided that the public recitations of
						Homer shall follow in fixed order<note n='a'>Or "in succession," though
							this is rather
							<foreign lang='greek'>e)c u(podoxh=s.</foreign>
							In Plato,
							<hi rend='ital'>Hipparchus</hi> 228 B, the same thing is
							expressed by
							<foreign lang='greek'>e)c u(polh/yews e)fech=s.</foreign></note>: thus the
						second
						reciter must begin from the place where the first
						left off. Hence, as Dieuchidas says in the fifth book
						of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Megarian History,</hi> Solon did more than
						Pisistratus to throw light on Homer. The passage in
						Homer more particularly referred to is that beginning "Those who dwelt at Athens ..."<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Iliad</hi> ii. 546.</note></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
					<p>Solon was the first to call the 30th day of the
						month the Old-and-New day, and to institute
						meetings of the nine archons for private conference,
						as stated by Apollodorus in the second book of his
						work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Legislators.</hi> When civil strife began, he
						did not take sides with those in the city, nor with
						the plain, nor yet with-the coast section.</p>
					<p>One of his sayings is: Speech is the mirror of
						action; and another that the strongest and most
						capable is king. He compared laws to spiders' webs,
						which stand firm when any light and yielding object
						falls upon them, while a larger thing breaks through
						them and makes off. Secrecy he called the seal of
						speech, and occasion the seal of secrecy. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
						He used
						to say that those who had influence with tyrants
						were like the pebbles employed in calculations; for,
						as each of the pebbles represented now a large and
						now a small number, so the tyrants would treat each
						one of those about them at one time as great and
						famous, at another as of no account. On being asked
						why he had not framed any law against parricide,
					<pb n='61'/>
					he replied that he hoped it was unnecessary. Asked
						how crime could most effectually be diminished, he
						replied, "If it caused as much resentment in those
						who are not its victims as in those who are," adding,
						"Wealth breeds satiety, satiety outrage." He required the Athenians to adopt a lunar month. He
						prohibited Thespis from performing tragedies on the
						ground that fiction was pernicious. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
						When therefore
						Pisistratus appeared with self-inflicted wounds, Solon
						said, "This comes from acting tragedies." His
						counsel to men in general is stated by Apollodorus
						in his work on the
						<hi rend='ital'>Philosophic Sects</hi> as follows:
						Put
						more trust in nobility of character than in an oath.
						Never tell a lie. Pursue worthy aims. Do not be
						rash to make friends and, when once they are made,
						do not drop them. Learn to obey before you command. In giving advice seek to help, not to please,
						your friend. Be led by reason. Shun evil company.
						Honour the gods, reverence parents. He is also said
						to have criticized the couplet of Mimnermus:</p>
					<p>Would that by no disease, no cares opprest,</p>
					<p>I in my sixtieth year were laid to rest;</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
					<p>and to have replied thus<note n='a'>Fr. 20 Bergk.</note>:</p>
					<p>Oh take a friend's suggestion, blot the line,</p>
					<p>Grudge not if my invention better thine;</p>
					<p>Surely a wiser wish were thus expressed,</p>
					<p>At eighty years let me be laid to rest.</p>
					<p>Of the songs sung this is attributed to Solon<note n='b'>Fr. 42
						Bergk.</note>:</p>
					<p>Watch every man and see whether, hiding hatred in his
					<pb n='63'/>
					heart, he speaks with friendly countenance, and his tongue
						rings with double speech from a dark soul.</p>
					<p>He is undoubtedly the author of the laws which
						bear his name; of speeches, and of poems in elegiac
						metre, namely, counsels addressed to himself, on
						Salamis and on the Athenian constitution, five thousand lines in all, not to mention poems in iambic
						metre and epodes.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
					<p>His statue has the following inscription<note n='a'><hi
						rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 86.</note>:</p>
					<p>At Salamis, which crushed the Persian might,</p>
					<p>Solon the legislator first saw light.</p>
					<p>He flourished, according to Sosicrates, about the
						46th Olympiad, in the third year of which he was
						archon at Athens<note n='b'>594 b.c.</note>; it was then that he
						enacted his
						laws. He died in Cyprus at the age of eighty. His
						last injunctions to his relations were on this wise:
						that they should convey his bones to Salamis and,
						when they had been reduced to ashes, scatter them
						over the soil. Hence Cratinus in his play,
						<hi rend='ital'>The

					<p>The following letters are attributed to Solon:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Solon to Periander</hi></hi></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
					<p>"You tell me that many are plotting against you.
						You must lose no time if you want to get rid of them
						all. A conspirator against you might arise from a
						quite unexpected quarter, say, one who had fears
						for his personal safety or one who disliked your
						timorous dread of anything and everything. He
						would earn the gratitude of the city who found out
						that you had no suspicion. The best course would
						be to resign power, and so be quit of the reproach.
						But if you must at all hazards remain tyrant, endeavour to make your mercenary force stronger than
						the forces of the city. Then you have no one to
						fear, and need not banish any one."</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Solon to Epimenides</hi></hi></p>
					<p>"It seems that after all I was not to confer much
						benefit on Athenians by my laws, any more than you
						by purifying the city. For religion and legislation
						are not sufficient in themselves to benefit cities; it
						can only be done by those who lead the multitude
						in any direction they choose. And so, if things are
						going well, religion and legislation are beneficial; if
						not, they are of no avail.</p>
					<pb n='67'/>

					<p>"Nor are my laws nor all my enactments any better;
						but the popular leaders did the commonwealth harm
						by permitting licence, and could not hinder Pisistratus
						from setting up a tyranny. And, when I warned
						them, they would not believe me. He found more
						credit when he flattered the people than I when I
						told them the truth. I laid my arms down before
						the generals' quarters and told the people that I
						was wiser than those who did not see that Pisistratus
						was aiming at tyranny, and more courageous than
						those who shrank from resisting him. They, however, denounced Solon as mad. And at last I protested: "My country, I, Solon, am ready to defend
						thee by word and deed; but some of my countrymen
						think me mad. Wherefore I will go forth out of
						their midst as the sole opponent of Pisistratus; and
						let them, if they like, become his bodyguard." For
						you must know, my friend, that he was beyond
						measure ambitious to be tyrant. 
						"<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
						He began by being
						a popular leader; his next step was to inflict wounds
						on himself and appear before the court of the Heliaea,
						crying out that these wounds had been inflicted by
						his enemies; and he requested them to give him a
						guard of 400 young men. And the people without
						listening to me granted him the men, who were
						armed with clubs. And after that he destroyed the
						democracy. It was in vain that I sought to free
						the poor amongst the Athenians from their condition
						of serfdom, if now they are all the slaves of one
						master, Pisistratus."</p>

					<p>"I am sure that I shall suffer no harm at your

						You are, I admit,

					<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
					<p>Chilon, son of Damagetas, was a Lacedaemonian.
						He wrote a poem in elegiac metre some 200 lines in
						length; and he declared that the excellence of a
						man is to divine the future so far as it can be grasped
						by reason. When his brother grumbled that he was
						not made ephor as Chilon was, the latter replied,
						"I know how to submit to injustice and you do not."
						He was made ephor in the 55th Olympiad; Pamphila,
						however, says the 56th. He first became ephor,
						according to Sosicrates, in the archonship of Euthy-
					<pb n='71'/>
					demus. He first proposed the appointment of ephors
						as auxiliaries to the kings, though Satyrus says this
						was done by Lycurgus.<note n='a'>There seems to be some confusion in
							these extracts.
							Possibly Diogenes Laertius found among his materials some
							such note as this:
							<foreign lang='greek'>*xi/lwn tw=n e(pta\ sofw=n prw=tos e)/foros,</foreign>
							and connected it with the date as given by Sosicrates,
							namely, the archonship of Euthydemus, meticulously correcting this date from Pamphila. 
							But he seems to have mislaken the meaning of
							<foreign lang='greek'>prw=tos e)/foros</foreign> and
							to have rashly
							inferred from it that it was Chilon who introduced the
							ephorate.</note></p>
					<p>As Herodotus relates in his first Book, when
						Hippocrates was sacrificing at Olympia and his
						cauldrons boiled of their own accord, it was Chilon
						who advised him not to marry, or, if he had a wife,
						to divorce her and disown his children. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
						The tale is
						also told that he inquired of Aesop what Zeus was
						doing and received the answer: "He is humbling
						the proud and exalting the humble." Being asked
						wherein lies the difference between the educated
						and the uneducated, Chilon answered, "In good
						hope." What is hard? "To keep a secret, to
						employ leisure well, to be able to bear an injury."
						These again are some of his precepts: To control
						the tongue, especially at a banquet. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
						Not to abuse
						our neighbours, for if you do, things will be said
						about you which you will regret. Do not use threats
						to any one; for that is womanish. Be more ready
						to visit friends in adversity than in prosperity. Do
						not make an extravagant marriage.
						<hi rend='ital'>De mortuis nil
							nisi bonum.</hi> Honour old age. Consult your own
						safety. Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain: the one
						brings pain at the moment, the other for all time.
						Do not laugh at another's misfortune. When strong,
						be merciful, if you would have the respect, not the
						fear, of your neighbours. Learn to be a wise master
						in your own house. Let not your tongue outrun
						your thought. Control anger. Do not hate divina-
					<pb n='73'/>
					tion. Do not aim at impossibilities. Let no one
						see you in a hurry. Gesticulation in speaking should
						be avoided as a mark of insanity. Obey the laws.
						Be restful.</p>

					<p>Of his songs the most popular is the following:
						"By the whetstone gold is tried, giving manifest
						proof; and by gold is the mind of good and evil
						men brought to the test." He is reported to have
						said in his old age that he was not aware of having
						ever broken the law throughout his life; but on one
						point he was not quite clear. In a suit in which a
						friend of his was concerned he himself pronounced
						sentence according to the law, but he persuaded his
						colleague who was his friend to acquit the accused,
						in order at once to maintain the law and yet not to
						lose his friend.</p>
					<p>He became very famous in Greece by his warning
						about the island of Cythera off the Laconian coast.
						For, becoming acquainted with the nature of the
						island, he exclaimed: "Would it had never been
						placed there, or else had been sunk in the depths
						of the sea." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
						And this was a wise warning; for
						Demaratus, when an exile from Sparta, advised
						Xerxes to anchor his fleet off the island; and if
						Xerxes had taken the advice Greece would have
						been conquered. Later, in the Peloponnesian war,
						Nicias reduced the island and placed an Athenian
						garrison there, and did the Lacedaemonians much
						mischief.</p>
					<p>He was a man of few words; hence Aristagoras
						of Miletus calls this style of speaking Chilonean. . . .
						is of Branchus, founder of the temple at Branchidae.
						Chilon was an old man about the 52nd Olympiad,
						when Aesop the fabulist was flourishing. According
					<pb n='75'/>
					to Hermippus, his death took place at Pisa, just
						after he had congratulated his son on an Olympic
						victory in boxing. It was due to excess of joy
						coupled with the weakness of a man stricken in
						years. And all present joined in the funeral procession.</p>
					<p>I have written an epitaph on him also, which runs

					<p>Pittacus was the son of Hyrrhadius and a native

					Melanchrus, tyrant of Lesbos; and in the war
						between Mitylene and Athens for the territory of
						Achileis he himself had the chief command on the

						Pittacus agreed to meet him in single combat; with

						an axe. When the people of Cyme sent the murderer
						to Pittacus, he, on learning the story, set him at
						liberty and declared that "It is better to pardon
						now than to repent later." Heraclitus, however, says
					<pb n='79'/>
					that it was Alcaeus whom he set at liberty when he
						had got him in his power, and that what he said
						was: "Mercy is better than vengeance."</p>
					<p>Among the laws which he made is one providing
						that for any offence committed in a state of intoxication the penalty should be doubled; his object was
						to discourage drunkenness, wine being abundant in
						the island. One of his sayings is, "It is hard to be
						good," which is cited by Simonides in this form:
						"Pittacus's maxim, `Truly to become a virtuous man

						Plato also cites him in the

						"Even the gods do not fight against necessity."
						Again, "Office shows the man." Once, when asked
						what is the best thing, he replied, "To do well
						the work in hand." And, when Croesus inquired
						what is the best rule, he answered, "The rule of the
						shifting wood," by which he meant the law. He
						also urged men to win bloodless victories. When
						the Phocaean said that we must search for a good
						man, Pittacus rejoined, "If you seek too carefully,
						you will never find him." He answered various
						inquiries thus: "What is agreeable?" "Time."
						"Obscure?" "The future." "Trustworthy?"
						"The earth." "Untrustworthy?" "The sea."
						"It is the part of prudent men," he said, "before
						difficulties arise, to provide against their arising;
						<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
						and of courageous men to deal with them when they
						have arisen." Do not announce your plans beforehand; for, if they fail, you will be laughed at. Never
						reproach any one with a misfortune, for fear of
						Nemesis. Duly restore what has been entrusted to
						you. Speak no ill of a friend, nor even of an enemy.

					<p>A stranger of Atarneus thus inquired of Pittacus, the son

					<p>So spake he. But Pittacus, raising his staff, an old man's

						whole tale."</p>
					<p>The boys were whipping their tops to make them go fast
						and spinning them in a wide open space.</p>
					<p>"Follow in their track," said he. So he approached near,

					<p>When he heard this, the stranger desisted from aiming at

					<p>And, even as he led home the humble bride, so do you,
					Dion, keep to your own sphere.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
					<p>The advice seems to have been prompted by his
						situation. For he had married a wife superior in

						haughtiness.</p>
					<p>Alcaeus nicknamed him

					<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
					<p>Bias, the son of Teutames, was born at Priene, and
						by Satyrus is placed at the head of the Seven Sages.
						Some make him of a wealthy family, but Duris
						says he was a labourer living in the house. Phanodicus relates that he ransomed certain Messenian
						maidens captured in war and brought them up as his
						daughters, gave them dowries, and restored them to
						their fathers in Messenia. In course of time, as has
						been already related, the bronze tripod with the
						inscription "To him that is wise" having been found
						at Athens by the fishermen, the maidens according
						to Satyrus, or their father according to other
						accounts, including that of Phanodicus, came forward into the assembly and, after the recital of their
						own adventures, pronounced Bias to be wise. And
						thereupon the tripod was dispatched to him; but
						Bias, on seeing it, declared that Apollo was wise,
						and refused to take the tripod. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
						But others say that
						he dedicated it to Heracles in Thebes, since he was
						a descendant of the Thebans who had founded a
						colony at Priene; and this is the version of Phanodieus.</p>
					<p>A story is told that, while Alyattes was besieging
						Priene, Bias fattened two mules and drove them into
						the camp, and that the king, when he saw them, was
						amazed at the good condition of the citizens actually
						extending to their beasts of burden. And he decided
					<pb n='87'/>
					to make terms and sent a messenger. But Bias piled
						up heaps of sand with a layer of corn on the top,
						and showed them to the man, and finally, on being
						informed of this, Alyattes made a treaty of peace
						with the people of Priene. Soon afterwards, when
						Alyattes sent to invite Bias to his court, he replied,
						"Tell Alyattes, from me, to make his diet of onions,"
						that is, to weep. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
						It is also stated that he was a
						very effective pleader; but he was accustomed to
						use his powers of speech to a good end. Hence it
						is to this that Demodicus of Leros makes reference
						in the line:</p>
					<p>If you happen to be prosecuting a suit, plead as they do
						at Priene;</p>
					<p>and Hipponax thus: "More powerful in pleading
						causes than Bias of Priene."<note n='a'>P. 79 Bergk; Strabo xiv. p.
							636.</note></p>
					<p>This was the manner of his death. He had been
						pleading in defence of some client in spite of his
						great age. When he had finished speaking, he reclined his head on his grandson's bosom. The opposing counsel made a speech, the judges voted and
						gave their verdict in favour of the client of Bias,
						who, when the court rose, was found dead in his
						grandson's arms. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
						The city gave him a magnificent
						funeral and inscribed on his tomb<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.

					<p>Here Bias of Priene lies, whose name</p>
					<p>Brought to his home and all Ionia fame.</p>

					<p>Here Bias rests. A quiet death laid low</p>
					<p>The aged head which years had strewn with snow.</p>
					<p>His pleading done, his friend preserved from harms,</p>
					<p>A long sleep took him in his grandson's arms.</p>
					<pb n='89'/>
					<p>He wrote a poem of 2000 lines on Ionia and the
						manner of rendering it prosperous. Of his songs the
						most popular is the following:</p>
					<p>Find favour with all the citizens . . .
						. . . in whatever state you dwell.</p>
					<p>For this earns most gratitude;
					the headstrong spirit often flashes forth with harmful bane.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
					<p>The growth of strength in man is nature's work;
						but to set forth in speech the interests of one's
						country is the gift of soul and reason. Even chance
						brings abundance of wealth to many. He also
						said that he who could not bear misfortune was
						truly unfortunate; that it is a disease of the soul to
						be enamoured of things impossible of attainment;
						and that we ought not to dwell upon the woes of
						others. Being asked what is difficult, he replied,
						"Nobly to endure a change for the worse." He
						was once on a voyage with some impious men; and,
						when a storm was encountered, even they began to
						call upon the gods for help. "Peace!" said he,
						"lest they hear and become aware that you are here
						in the ship." When an impious man asked him to
						define piety, he was silent; and when the other
						inquired the reason, "I am silent," he replied,
						"because you are asking questions about what does
						not concern you."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
					<p>Being asked "What is sweet to men," he
						answered, "Hope." He said he would rather
						decide a dispute between two of his enemies than
						between two of his friends; for in the latter case
						he would be certain to make one of his friends
						his enemy, but in the former case he would make
						one of his enemies his friend. Asked what occupation gives a man most pleasure, he replied, "Making
					<pb n='91'/>
					money." He advised men to measure life as if they
						had both a short and a long time to live; to love
						their friends as if they would some day hate them,
						the majority of mankind being bad. Further, he
						gave this advice: Be slow to set about an enterprise, but persevere in it steadfastly when once it is
						undertaken. Do not be hasty of speech, for that
						is a sign of madness. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
						Cherish wisdom. Admit the
						existence of the gods. If a man is unworthy, do not
						praise him because of his wealth. Gain your point
						by persuasion, not by force. Ascribe your good
						actions to the gods. Make wisdom your provision
						for the journey from youth to old age; for it is a
						more certain support than all other possessions.</p>
					<p>Bias is mentioned by Hipponax as stated above,
						and Heraclitus, who is hard to please, bestows upon
						him especial praise in these words<note n='a'>P. 39 d, 112 b.</note>:
						"In Priene
						lived Bias, son of Teutames, a man of more consideration than any." And the people of Priene dedicated
						a precinct to him, which is called the Teutameum.
						His apophthegm is: Most men are bad.</p>

					<p>Of his songs the most popular are: It is want of

						When anyone leaves his house, let him first inquire

						to be friendly to virtue, hostile to vice; to shun
						injustice; to counsel the state for the best; not to

						daughter of Aristocrates and sister of Aristodemus,
						who together reigned over nearly the whole of
						Arcadia, as stated by Heraclides of Pontus in his book
						<hi rend='ital'>On Government.</hi> By her he had two sons, Cypselus
						and Lycophron, the younger a man of intelligence,
						the elder weak in mind. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
						However, after some time,
						in a fit of anger, he killed his wife by throwing
						a footstool at her, or by a kick, when she was pregnant, having been egged on by the slanderous tales
						of concubines, whom he afterwards burnt alive.</p>
					<p>When the son whose name was Lycophron grieved
					<pb n='99'/>
					for his mother, he banished him to Corcyra. And
						when well advanced in years he sent for his son to
						be his successor in the tyranny; but the Corcyraeans
						put him to death before he could set sail. Enraged
						at this, he dispatched the sons of the Corcyraeans
						to Alyattes that he might make eunuchs of them;
						but, when the ship touched at Samos, they took
						sanctuary in the temple of Hera, and were saved by
						the Samians.</p>
					<p>Periander lost heart and died at the age of
						eighty. Sosicrates' account is that he died fortyone years before Croesus, just before the 49th

					<p>There is a story that he did not wish the place

						The
					<pb n='107'/>

						Solon to tell him that men as a rule choose their
						guests from among their own countrymen. Then
						Anacharsis took him up and said that he was now
						in his own country and had a right to be entertained
						as a guest. And Solon, struck with his ready wit,
						admitted him into his house and made him his
						greatest friend.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
					<p>After a while Anacharsis returned to Scythia,
						where, owing to his enthusiasm for everything Greek,
						he was supposed to be subverting the national institutions, and was killed by his brother while they
						were out hunting together. When struck by the
						arrow he exclaimed, "My reputation carried me
						safe through Greece, but the envy it excited at
						home has been my ruin." In some accounts it is
						said that he was slain while performing Greek rites.</p>
					<p>Here is my own epitaph upon him<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
						Pal.</hi> vii. 92.</note>:</p>
					<p>Back from his travels Anacharsis came,</p>
					<p>To hellenize the Scythians all aglow;</p>
					<p>Ere half his sermon could their minds inflame,</p>
					<p>A wing&egrave;d arrow laid the preacher low.</p>
					<p>It was a saying of his that the vine bore three
						kinds of grapes: the first of pleasure, the next of
						intoxication, and the third of disgust. He said he
						wondered why in Greece experts contend in the
						games and non-experts award the prizes. Being
						asked how one could avoid becoming a toper, he
						answered, "By keeping before your eyes the disgraceful exhibition made by the drunkard." Again,
						he expressed surprise that the Greek lawgivers should
						impose penalties on wanton outrage, while they
						honour athletes for bruising one another. After
					<pb n='109'/>
					ascertaining that the ship's side was four fingers'
						breadth in thickness, he remarked that the passengers
						were just so far from death.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
					<p>Oil he called a drug which produced madness,
						because the athletes when they anoint themselves
						with it are maddened against each other. How is
						it, he asked, that the Greeks prohibit falsehood and
						yet obviously tell falsehoods in retail trade? Nor
						could he understand why at the beginning of their
						feasts they drink from small goblets and when they
						are "full" from large ones. The inscription on his
						statues is: "Bridle speech, gluttony, and sensuality."
						Being asked if there were flutes in Scythia, he replied,
						"No, nor yet vines." To the question what vessels
						were the safest his reply was, "Those which have
						been hauled ashore." And he declared the strangest
						thing he had seen in Greece to be that they leave
						the smoke on the mountains and convey the fuel
						into the city.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> in the form of

							<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> A. S. Ferguson in

						inquired which
						were more in number, the living or the dead, he
						rejoined, "In which category, then, do you place
						those who are on the seas?" When some Athenian
						reproached him with being a Scythian, he replied,
						"Well, granted that my country is a disgrace to
						me, you are a disgrace to your country." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
						To the
						question, "What among men is both good and bad?"
						his answer was "The tongue." He said it was
						better to have one friend of great worth than many
						friends worth nothing at all. He defined the market
						as a place set apart where men may deceive and
						overreach one another. When insulted by a boy
						over the wine he said, "If you cannot carry your
						liquor when you are young, boy, you will be a water
						carrier when you are old."</p>
					<pb n='111'/>
					<p>According to some he was the inventor of the anchor
						and the potter's wheel.</p>
					<p>To him is attributed the following letter:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Anacharsis to

					<p>"I have come, O King of the Lydians, to the land

					<p>Myson was the son of Strymon, according to

						and a native of Chen, a village in the district of
						Oeta or Laconia; and he is reckoned one of the
						Seven Sages. They say that his father was a tyrant.
						We are told by some one that, when Anacharsis
						inquired if there were anyone wiser than himself,

					<p>Myson of Chen in Oeta; this is he</p>
					<p>Who for wiseheartedness surpasseth thee.</p>
					<p>His curiosity aroused, Anacharsis went to the village in

						and said, "Myson, this is not the season for the
						plough." "It is just the time to repair it," was the
						reply. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
						Others cite the first line of the oracle differently, "Myson of Chen in Etis," and inquire what
					<pb n='113'/>
					"Myson of Etis" means. Parmenides indeed explains that Etis is a district in Laconia to which
						Myson belonged. Sosicrates in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of

						side and to Chen on the mother's. Euthyphro, the
						son of Heraclides of Pontus, declares that he was a

						makes him an Arcadian.</p>
					<p>Myson is mentioned by Hipponax, the words

						At any rate he was seen in Lacedaemon laughing to himself in a lonely spot; and

						that the reason why he remained obscure was that
						he belonged to no city but to a village and that an

					<head>Chapter 10. EPIMENIDES (c. 600 B.C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>
					<p>Epimenides, according to Theopompus and many
						other writers, was the son of Phaestius; some, however, make him the son of Dosiadas, others of
						Agesarchus. He was a native of Cnossos in Crete,
						though from wearing his hair long he did not look
						like a Cretan. One day he was sent into the country
						by his father to look for a stray sheep, and at noon
						he turned aside out of the way, and went to sleep
						in a cave, where he slept for fifty-seven years. After
						this he got up and went in search of the sheep, thinking he had been asleep only a short time. And when
						he could not find it, he came to the farm, and found
						everything changed and another owner in possession.
						Then he went back to the town in utter perplexity;
						and there, on entering his own house, he fell in with
						people who wanted to know who he was. At length
						he found his younger brother, now an old man, and
						learnt the truth from him. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
						So he became famous
						throughout Greece, and was believed to be a special
						favourite of heaven.</p>
					<p>Hence, when the Athenians were attacked by
						pestilence, and the Pythian priestess bade them
						purify the city, they sent a ship commanded by
						Nicias, son of Niceratus, to Crete to ask the help of
						Epimenides. And he came in the 46th Olympiad,<note n='a'>595-592
							b.c.</note>
						purified their city, and stopped the pestilence in the
						following way. He took sheep, some black and
						others white, and brought them to the Areopagus;
						and there he let them go whither they pleased,
						instructing those who followed them to mark the
						spot where each sheep lay down and offer a sacrifice
						to the local divinity. And thus, it is said, the plague
						was stayed. Hence even to this day altars may be
					<pb n='117'/>
					found in different parts of Attica with no name
						inscribed upon them, which are memorials of this
						atonement. According to some writers he declared
						the plague to have been caused by the pollution
						which Cylon brought on the city and showed them
						how to remove it. In consequence two young men,
						Cratinus and Ctesibius, were put to death and the
						city was delivered from the scourge.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
					<p>The Athenians voted him a talent in money and
						a ship to convey him back to Crete. The money he
						declined, but he concluded a treaty of friendship
						and alliance between Cnossos and Athens.</p>
					<p>So he returned home and soon afterwards died.
						According to Phlegon in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Longevity</hi> he
						lived
						one hundred and fifty-seven years; according to the
						Cretans two hundred and ninety-nine years. Xenophanes of Colophon gives his age as 154, according

						on the building of the Argo and Jason's voyage to
						Colchis in 6500 lines.

						He also compiled prose works
						<hi rend='ital'>On Sacrifices and the Cretan Constitution,</hi> also
						<hi rend='ital'>On

					<pb n='119'/>
					<p>There is extant a letter of his to Solon the lawgiver, containing a scheme of government which
						Minos drew up for the Cretans. But Demetrius of
						Magnesia, in his work on poets and writers of the
						same name, endeavours to discredit the letter on the
						ground that it is late and not written in the Cretan
						dialect but in Attic, and New Attic too. However, I have found another letter by him which runs
						as follows:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Epimenides to Solon</hi></hi></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>
					<p>"Courage, my friend. For if Pisistratus had attacked
						the Athenians while they were still serfs and before
						they had good laws, he would have secured power in
						perpetuity by the enslavement of the citizens. But,
						as it is, he is reducing to subjection men who are no
						cowards, men who with pain and shame remember
						Solon's warning and will never endure to be under a
						tyrant. But even should Pisistratus himself hold
						down the city, I do not expect that his power will
						be continued to his children; for it is hard to contrive that men brought up as free men under the
						best laws should be slaves. But, instead of going on
						your travels, come quietly to Crete to me; for here
						you will have no monarch to fear, whereas, if some
						of his friends should fall in with you while you are
						travelling about, I fear you may come to some harm.'</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
					<p>This is the tenor of the letter. But Demetrius reports a story that he received from the Nymphs food
						of a special sort and kept it in a cow's hoof; that he
						took small doses of this food, which was entirely
						absorbed into his system, and he was never seen to
						eat. Timaeus mentions him in his second book.
						Some writers say that the Cretans sacrifice to him
					<pb n='121'/>
					as a god; for they say that he had superhuman
						foresight. For instance, when he saw Munichia, at
						Athens, he said the Athenians did not know how
						many evils that place would bring upon them; for,
						if they did, they would destroy it even if they had
						to do so with their teeth. And this he said so long
						before the event. It is also stated that he was the
						first to call himself Aeacus; that he foretold to the
						Lacedaemonians their defeat by the Arcadians; and
						that he claimed that his soul had passed through
						many incarnations.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
					<p>Theopompus relates in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Mirabilia</hi> that, as he
						was building a temple to the Nymphs, a voice came
						from heaven: "Epimenides, not a temple to the
						Nymphs but to Zeus," and that he foretold to the
						Cretans the defeat of the Lacedaemonians by the
						Arcadians, as already stated; and in very truth they
						were crushed at Orchomenus.</p>
					<p>And he became old in as many days as he had
						slept years; for this too is stated by Theopompus.
						Myronianus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Parallels</hi> declares that the
						Cretans
						called him one of the Curetes. The Lacedaemonians
						guard his body in their own keeping in obedience to
						a certain oracle; this is stated by Sosibius the
						Laconian.</p>

					<p>He bade the Lacedaemonians set no store by gold

						<hi rend='ital'>Mirabilia.</hi> He
						told them he had received this command from

						enjoined upon the kings to obey Pherecydes. But
						some fasten this story upon Pythagoras.</p>
					<p>Hermippus relates that on the eve of war between
						Ephesus and Magnesia he favoured the cause of the
						Ephesians, and inquired of some one passing by where
						he came from, and on receiving the reply "From
						Ephesus," he said, "Drag me by the legs and place
						me in the territory of Magnesia; and take a message
						to your countrymen that after their victory they
						must bury me there, and that this is the last injunction of Pherecydes." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
						The man gave the message;
						a day later the Ephesians attacked and defeated
						the Magnesians; they found Pherecydes dead and
						buried him on the spot with great honours. Another
					<pb n='125'/>
					version is that he came to Delphi and hurled himself
						down from Mount Corycus. But Aristoxenus in his
						work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Pythagoras and his School</hi> affirms that he
						died a natural death and was buried by Pythagoras
						in Delos; another account again is that he died of
						a verminous disease, that Pythagoras was also present
						and inquired how he was, that he thrust his finger
						through the doorway and exclaimed, "My skin tells
						its own tale," a phrase subsequently applied by the
						grammarians as equivalent to "getting worse,"
						although some wrongly understand it to mean "all
						is going well." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
						He maintained that the divine name
						for "table" is
						<foreign lang='greek'>quwro/s</foreign>, or that which
						takes care of
						offerings.</p>
					<p>Andron of Ephesus says that there were two
						natives of Syros who bore the name of Pherecydes:
						the one was an astronomer, the other was the son
						of Babys and a theologian, teacher of Pythagoras.
						Eratosthenes, however, says that there was only one
						Pherecydes of Syros, the other Pherecydes being an
						Athenian and a genealogist.</p>
					<p>There is preserved a work by Pherecydes of Syros,
						a work which begins thus: "Zeus and Time and

					<p>"May yours be a happy death when your time

						that the earth, which is of spherical shape, lies in

					<p>Anaxagoras, the son of Hegesibulus or Eubulus,
						was a native of Clazomenae. He was a pupil of
						Anaximenes, and was the first who set mind above
					<pb n='137'/>
					matter, for at the beginning of his treatise, which
						is composed in attractive and dignified language, he
						says, "All things were together; then came Mind
						and set them in order." This earned for Anaxagoras
						himself the nickname of Nous or Mind, and Timon
						in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi> says of him<note n='a'>Fr. 24
							d.</note>:</p>
					<p>Then, I ween, there is Anaxagoras, a doughty champion,
						whom they call Mind, because forsooth his was the mind
						which suddenly woke up and fitted closely together all that
						had formerly been in a medley of confusion.</p>
					<p>He was eminent for wealth and noble birth, and
						furthermore for magnanimity, in that he gave up
						his patrimony to his relations. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
						For, when they
						accused him of neglecting it, he replied, "Why then
						do you not look after it?" And at last he went into
						retirement and engaged in physical investigation
						without troubling himself about public affairs. When
						some one inquired, "Have you no concern in your
						native land?" "Gently," he replied, "I am greatly
						concerned with my fatherland," and pointed to the
						sky.</p>
					<p>He is said to have been twenty years old at the invasion of Xerxes and to have lived seventy-two years.
						Apollodorus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> says that he was
						born
						in the 70th Olympiad,<note n='b'>500-497 b.c.</note> and died in the
						first year of
						the 88th Olympiad.<note n='c'>428 b.c.</note> He began to study
						philosophy
						at Athens in the archonship of Callias<note n='d'><hi

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					<p>He declared the sun to be a mass of red-hot metal
						and to be larger than the Peloponnesus, though
						others ascribe this view to Tantalus; he declared
						that there were dwellings on the moon, and moreover
					<pb n='139'/>
					hills and ravines. He took as his principles the
						homoeomeries or homogeneous molecules; for just
						as gold consists of fine particles which are called
						gold-dust, so he held the whole universe to be compounded of minute bodies having parts homogeneous
						to themselves. His moving principle was Mind; of
						bodies, he said, some, like earth, were heavy, occupying the region below, others, light like fire, held the
						region above, while water and air were intermediate
						in position. For in this way over the earth, which
						is flat, the sea sinks down after the moisture has
						been evaporated by the sun. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
						In the beginning the
						stars moved in the sky as in a revolving dome, so
						that the celestial pole which is always visible was
						vertically overhead; but subsequently the pole took
						its inclined position. He held the Milky Way to be
						a reflection of the light of stars which are not shone
						upon by the sun; comets to be a conjunction of
						planets which emit flames; shooting-stars to be a
						sort of sparks thrown off by the air. He held that
						winds arise when the air is rarefied by the sun's
						heat; that thunder is a clashing together of the
						clouds, lightning their violent friction; an earthquake a subsidence of air into the earth.</p>
					<p>Animals were produced from moisture, heat, and

						ever become sea, he replied, "Yes, it only needs
						time." Being asked to what end he had been
						born, he replied, "To study sun and moon and
						heavens." To one who inquired, "You miss the
						society of the Athenians?" his reply was, "Not I,
						but they miss mine." When he saw the tomb of
						Mausolus, he said, "A costly tomb is an image of
						an estate turned into stone."<note n='a'>Anaxagoras, whose death falls

					<p>Of the trial of Anaxagoras different accounts are

						says that he was indicted by Cleon on a charge of
						impiety, because he declared the sun to be a mass
						of red-hot metal; that his pupil Pericles defended
						him, and he was fined five talents and banished.
						Satyrus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that the prosecutor was
						Thucydides, the opponent of Pericles, and the charge
						one of treasonable correspondence with Persia as
						well as of impiety; and that sentence of death was
						passed on Anaxagoras by default. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
						When news was
						brought him that he was condemned and his sons
						were dead, his comment on the sentence was, "Long
						ago nature condemned both my judges and myself
						to death"; and on his sons, "I knew that my
						children were born to die." Some, however, tell
						this story of Solon, and others of Xenophon. That
						he buried his sons with his own hands is asserted by
						Demetrius of Phalerum in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Old Age.</hi>
						Hermippus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that he was confined
						in
						the prison pending his execution; that Pericles
						came forward and asked the people whether they
						had any fault to find with him in his own public
						career; to which they replied that they had not.
						"Well," he continued, "I am a pupil of Anaxagoras;
						do not then be carried away by slanders and put
						him to death. Let me prevail upon you to release

						the indignity he had suffered and committed suicide.

						Hieronymus in the second book of his

					acquittal not so much to the merits of his case as to
						the sympathy of the judges. So much then on the
						subject of his trial.</p>
					<p>He was supposed to have borne Democritus a
						grudge because he had failed to get into communication with him.<note n='a'>In ix. 34, 35 the statement that Democritus
							was hostile
							to Anaxagoras and criticized his doctrines is ascribed to
							Favorinus, and, as the motive alleged is similar, Favorinus

						and there died. And when the magistrates of the

						for him, he replied that he would like them to grant
						an annual holiday to the boys in the month in which

						natural philosophy from Ionia to Athens. Archelaus
						was the teacher of Socrates. He was called the
						physicist inasmuch as with him natural philosophy
						came to an end, as soon as Socrates had introduced
						ethics. It would seem that Archelaus himself also
						treated of ethics, for he has discussed laws and
						goodness and justice; Socrates took the subject
						from him and, having improved it to the utmost,
						was regarded as its inventor. Archelaus laid down
						that there were two causes of growth or becoming,
						heat and cold; that living things were produced
						from slime; and that what is just and what is base
						depends not upon nature but upon convention.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<p>His theory is to this effect. Water is melted by
						heat and produces on the one hand earth in so far
						as by the action of fire it sinks and coheres, while
						on the other hand it generates air in so far as it
						overflows on all sides. Hence the earth is confined
						by the air, and the air by the circumambient fire.
						Living things, he holds, are generated from the
						earth when it is heated and throws off slime of the
						consistency of milk to serve as a sort of nourishment,
						and in this same way the earth produced man. He
						was the first who explained the production of sound
						as being the concussion of the air, and the formation
						of the sea in hollow places as due to its filtering
						through the earth. He declared the sun to be the
						largest of the heavenly bodies and the universe to
						be unlimited.</p>
					<p>There have been three other men who bore the

						who was tried and put to death. Aristoxenus, the
						son of Spintharus, says of him that he made money;
						he would at all events invest sums, collect the interest

					<p>Demetrius of Byzantium relates that Crito removed

					<p>that frequently, owing to his vehemence in argument, men set upon him with their fists or tore his

					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
					<p>Unlike most philosophers, he had no need to
						travel, except when required to go on an expedition.
						The rest of his life he stayed at home and engaged
						all the more keenly in argument with anyone who
						would converse with him, his aim being not to alter
						his opinion but to get at the truth. They relate that
						Euripides gave him the treatise of Heraclitus and
						asked his opinion upon it, and that his reply was,

					<p>He took care to exercise his body and kept in

						stepped in and saved his life. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
						For in the general
						flight of the Athenians he personally retired at his

						Again, he served at Potidaea, whither he had gone
						by sea, as land communications were interrupted by
						the war<note n='a'>The reason assigned for an expedition to Potidaea by

					<p>His strength of will and attachment to the democracy are evident from his refusal to yield to Critias

						and Scopas of Cranon and Eurylochus of Larissa by
						refusing to accept their presents or to go to their
						court. He was so orderly in his way of life that on
					<pb n='157'/>
					several occasions when pestilence broke out in Athens
					he was the only man who escaped infection.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
					<p>Aristotle says that he married two wives: his first
						wife was Xanthippe, by whom he had a son, Lamprocles; his second wife was Myrto, the daughter of
						Aristides the Just, whom he took without a dowry.
						By her he had Sophroniscus and Menexenus. Others
						make Myrto his first wife; while some writers,
						including Satyrus and Hieronymus of Rhodes, affirm
						that they were both his wives at the same time.
						For they say that the Athenians were short of men
						and, wishing to increase the population, passed a
						decree permitting a citizen to marry one Athenian
						woman and have children by another; and that
						Socrates accordingly did so.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
					<p>He could afford to despise those who scoffed at
						him. He prided himself on his plain living, and
						never asked a fee from anyone. He used to say that
						he most enjoyed the food which was least in need
						of condiment, and the drink which made him feel
						the least hankering for some other drink; and that
						he was nearest to the gods in that he had the fewest
						wants. This may be seen from the Comic poets,
						who in the act of ridiculing him give him high praise.
						Thus Aristophanes<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Clouds</hi>,
							412-417.</note>:</p>
					<p>O man that justly desirest great wisdom, how blessed will be
						thy life amongst Athenians and Greeks, retentive of memory
						and thinker that thou art, with endurance of toil for thy
						character; never art thou weary whether standing or walk-
					<pb n='159'/>
					ing, never numb with cold, never hungry for breakfast; from
						wine and from gross feeding and all other frivolities thou
						dost turn away.</p>
					<milestone unit="sectio" n="28"/>
					<p>Ameipsias too, when he puts him on the stage
						wearing a cloak, says<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Sc.</hi> in the
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Connus</hi>, Meineke,
							<hi rend='ital'>C.G.F.</hi> i. 201
							sq., ii. 703.</note>:</p>
					<p>a. You come to join us, Socrates, worthiest of a small
						band and emptiest by far! You are a robust fellow. Where
						can we get you a proper coat?</p>
					<p>b. Your sorry plight is an insult to the cobblers.</p>
					<p>a. And yet, hungry as he is, this man has never stooped
						to flatter.</p>
					<p>This disdainful, lofty spirit of his is also noticed by
						Aristophanes when he says<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Clouds</hi>,
							362.</note>:</p>
					<p>Because you stalk along the streets, rolling your eyes,
						and endure, barefoot, many a hardship, and gaze up at us
						[the clouds].</p>
					<p>And yet at times he would even put on fine clothes
						to suit the occasion, as in Plato's
						<hi

							he is on his way to Agathon's house.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
					<p>He showed equal ability in both directions, in
						persuading and dissuading men; thus, after conversing with Theaetetus about knowledge, he sent
						him away, as Plato says, fired with a divine impulse;
						but when Euthyphro had indicted his father for
						manslaughter, Socrates, after some conversation with
						him upon piety, diverted him from his purpose.
						Lysis, again, he turned, by exhortation, into a most
						virtuous character. For he had the skill to draw
						his arguments from facts. And when his son
					<pb n='161'/>
					Lamprocles was violently angry with his mother,
						Socrates made him feel ashamed of himself, as I
						believe Xenophon has told us. When Plato's brother
						Glaucon was desirous of entering upon politics,
						Socrates dissuaded him, as Xenophon relates, because
						of his want of experience; but on the contrary he
						encouraged Charmides to take up politics because he
						had a gift that way.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Mem.</hi> iii.
						7.</note></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
					<p>He roused Iphicrates the general to a martial
						spirit by showing him how the fighting cocks of
						Midias the barber flapped their wings in defiance of
						those of Callias. Glauconides demanded that he
						should be acquired for the state as if he were some
						pheasant or peacock.</p>
					<p>He used to say it was strange that, if you asked
						a man how many sheep he had, he could easily tell
						you the precise number; whereas he could not name
						his friends or say how many he had, so slight was
						the value he set upon them. Seeing Euclides keenly
						interested in eristic arguments, he said to him:
						"You will be able to get on with sophists, Euclides,
						but with men not at all." For he thought there
						was no use in this sort of hair-splitting, as Plato shows
						us in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Euthydemus.</hi></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
					<p>Again, when Charmides offered him some slaves in
						order that he might derive an income from them, he
						declined the offer; and according to some he scorned
						the beauty of Alcibiades. He would extol leisure as
						the best of possessions, according to Xenophon in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Symposium.</hi> There is, he said, only one good, that
						is, knowledge, and only one evil, that is, ignorance;
						wealth and good birth bring their possessor no
						dignity, but on the contrary evil. At all events,
						when some one told him that Antisthenes' mother
					<pb n='163'/>
					was a Thracian, he replied, "Nay, did you expect
						a man so noble to have been born of two Athenian
						parents?" He made Crito ransom Phaedo who,
						having been taken prisoner in the war, was kept in
						degrading slavery, and so won him for philosophy.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
					<p>Moreover, in his old age he learnt to play the lyre,
						declaring that he saw no absurdity in learning a new
						accomplishment. As Xenophon relates in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>, it was his regular habit to dance, thinking
						that such exercise helped to keep the body in good
						condition. He used to say that his supernatural
						sign warned him beforehand of the future; that to
						make a good start was no trifling advantage, but a
						trifle turned the scale; and that he knew nothing
						except just the fact of his ignorance. He said that,
						when people paid a high price for fruit which had
						ripened early, they must despair of seeing the fruit
						ripen at the proper season. And, being once asked
						in what consisted the virtue of a young man, he
						said, "In doing nothing to excess." He held that
						geometry should be studied to the point at which a
						man is able to measure the land which he acquires
						or parts with.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
					<p>On hearing the line of Euripides' play

					<p>he got up and left the theatre. For he said it was
						absurd to make a hue and cry about a slave who
						could not be found, and to allow virtue to perish in
						this way. Some one asked him whether he should
						marry or not, and received the reply, "Whichever
						you do you will repent it." He used to express his
						astonishment that the sculptors of marble statues
					<pb n='165'/>
					should take pains to make the block of marble into
						a perfect likeness of a man, and should take no pains
						about themselves lest they should turn out mere
						blocks, not men. He recommended to the young
						the constant use of the mirror, to the end that handsome men might acquire a corresponding behaviour,
						and ugly men conceal their defects by education.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
					<p>He had invited some rich men and, when Xanthippe
						said she felt ashamed of the dinner, "Never mind,"
						said he, "for if they are reasonable they will put up
						with it, and if they are good for nothing, we shall
						not trouble ourselves about them." He would say
						that the rest of the world lived to eat, while he
						himself ate to live. Of the mass of men who do
						not count he said it was as if some one should object
						to a single tetradrachm as counterfeit and at the
						same time let a whole heap made up of just such
						pieces pass as genuine. Aeschines said to him, "I
						am a poor man and have nothing else to give, but
						I offer you myself," and Socrates answered, "Nay,
						do you not see that you are offering me the greatest
						gift of all?" To one who complained that he was
						overlooked when the Thirty rose to power, he said,
						"You are not sorry for that, are you?" 
						<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
						To one
						who said, "You are condemned by the Athenians to
						die," he made answer, "So are they, by nature."
						But some ascribe this to Anaxagoras. When his
						wife said, "You suffer unjustly," he retorted, "Why,
						would you have me suffer justly?" He had a dream
						that some one said to him<note n='a'>Hom.
							<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> ix.
							363.</note>:</p>
					<p>On the third day thou shalt come to the fertile fields of
						Phthia;</p>
					<p>and he told Aeschines, "On the third day I shall
						die."<note n='b'>The proposal that Socrates should escape from prison
							was attributed to Aeschines as well as to Crito (see below, 60). The
							Homeric citation occurs in Plato's
							<hi rend='ital'>Crito</hi>, 44
							b.</note> When he was about to drink the hemlock,
					<pb n='167'/>
					Apollodorus offered him a beautiful garment to
						die in: "What," said he, "is my own good
						enough to live in but not to die in?" When
						he was told that So-and-so spoke ill of him, he
						replied, "True, for he has never learnt to speak
						well." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
						When Antisthenes turned his cloak so that
						the tear in it came into view, "I see," said he,
						"your vanity through your cloak." To one who
						said, "Don't you find so-and-so very offensive?" his
						reply was, "No, for it takes two to make a quarrel."
						We ought not to object, he used to say, to be subjects for the Comic poets, for if they satirize our
						faults they will do us good, and if not they do not
						touch us. When Xanthippe first scolded him and
						then drenched him with water, his rejoinder was,
						"Did I not say that Xanthippe's thunder would end
						in rain?" When Alcibiades declared that the scolding of Xanthippe was intolerable, "Nay, I have got
						used to it," said he, "as to the continued rattle of
						a windlass. And you do not mind the cackle of
						geese." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
						"No," replied Alcibiades, "but they furnish me with eggs and goslings." "And Xanthippe,"
						said Socrates, "is the mother of my children." When
						she tore his coat off his back in the market-place and
						his acquaintances advised him to hit back, "Yes, by
						Zeus," said he, "in order that while we are sparring
						each of you may join in with `Go it, Socrates!'
						`Well done, Xanthippe!' " He said he lived with
						a shrew, as horsemen are fond of spirited horses,
						"but just as, when they have mastered these, they
						can easily cope with the rest, so I in the society of
						Xanthippe shall learn to adapt myself to the rest of
						the world."</p>
					<p>These and the like were his words and deeds, to

					which the Pythian priestess bore testimony when

					<p>For this he was most envied; and especially because

					<p>The indictment was brought by Meletus, and the

						<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History.</hi> The speech
						was written by Polycrates the sophist, according to

					<p>Antisthenes in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>,
						and
						Plato in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Apology</hi>, say that there were three
						accusers, Anytus, Lycon and Meletus; that Anytus
						was roused to anger on behalf of the craftsmen and
						politicians, Lycon on behalf of the rhetoricians,
						Meletus of the poets, all three of which classes had
						felt the lash of Socrates. Favorinus in the first
						book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> declares that the speech
						of
						Polycrates against Socrates is not authentic; for he
						mentions the rebuilding of the walls by Conon, which
					<pb n='171'/>
					did not take place till six years after the death of
					Socrates. And this is the case.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
					<p>The affidavit in the case, which is still preserved, says
						Favorinus, in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Metron</hi>, ran as follows: "This
						indictment and affidavit is sworn by Meletus, the son
						of Meletus of Pitthos, against Socrates, the son of
						Sophroniscus of Alopece: Socrates is guilty of refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state, and
						of introducing other new divinities. He is also guilty
						of corrupting the youth. The penalty demanded is
						death." The philosopher then, after Lysias had
						written a defence for him, read it through and said:
						"A fine speech, Lysias; it is not, however, suitable
						to me." For it was plainly more forensic than
						philosophical. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
						Lysias said, "If it is a fine speech,
						how can it fail to suit you?" "Well," he replied,
						"would not fine raiment and fine shoes be just as
						unsuitable to me?"</p>
					<p>Justus of Tiberias in his book entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>The
							Wreath</hi>
						says that in the course of the trial Plato mounted
						the platform and began: "Though I am the
						youngest, men of Athens, of all who ever rose to
						address you"--whereupon the judges shouted out,
						"Get down! Get down!" When therefore he was
						condemned by 281 votes more than those given for
						acquittal, and when the judges were assessing what
						he should suffer or what fine he should pay, he proposed to pay 25 drachmae. Eubulides indeed says
						he offered 100. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
						When this caused an uproar among
						the judges, he said, "Considering my services, I
						assess the penalty at maintenance in the Prytaneum
						at the public expense."</p>
					<p>Sentence of death was passed, with an accession
						of eighty fresh votes. He was put in prison, and a
					<pb n='173'/>
					few days afterwards drank the hemlock, after much
						noble discourse which Plato records in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Phaedo.</hi>
						Further, according to some, he composed a paean
						beginning:</p>
					<p>All hail, Apollo, Delos' lord!</p>
					<p>Hail Artemis, ye noble pair!</p>
					<p>Dionysodorus denies that he wrote the paean. He
						also composed a fable of Aesop, not very skilfully,
						beginning<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iv.
							16.</note>:</p>
					<p>"Judge not, ye men of Corinth," Aesop cried,</p>
					<p>"Of virtue as the jury-courts decide."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
					<p>So he was taken from among men; and not long
						afterwards the Athenians felt such remorse that they
						shut up the training grounds and gymnasia. They
						banished the other accusers but put Meletus to death;
						they honoured Socrates with a bronze statue, the
						work of Lysippus, which they placed in the hall
						of processions. And no sooner did Anytus visit
						Heraclea than the people of that town expelled him
						on that very day. Not only in the case of Socrates
						but in very many others the Athenians repented in
						this way. For they fined Homer (so says Heraclides<note n='b'>Most
							probably Heraclides of Pontus. This remarkable
							assertion may have occurred in one of his dialogues, and
							was perhaps not meant to be taken seriously.</note>)
						50 drachmae for a madman, and said Tyrtaeus was

						Aeschylus and his brother poets with a bronze statue.

					<p>In my opinion Socrates discoursed on physics as

						about providence, even according to Xenophon, who,
						however, declares that he only discussed ethics. But

					<p>Xenophon, the son of Gryllus, was a citizen of

					a man of rare modesty and extremely handsome.
						The story goes that Socrates met him in a narrow
						passage, and that he stretched out his stick to bar
						the way, while he inquired where every kind of
						food was sold. Upon receiving a reply, he put
						another question, "And where do men become good
						and honourable?" Xenophon was fairly puzzled;
						"Then follow me," said Socrates, "and learn." From
						that time onward he was a pupil of Socrates. He
						was the first to take notes of, and to give to the
						world, the conversation of Socrates, under the title
						of
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia.</hi> Moreover, he was the first to
						write
						a history of philosophers.</p>
					<p>Aristippus, in the fourth book of his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the

						and said in reference to him, "It is

						I am vexed with the night and with sleep because
						I cannot see Clinias, and most grateful to the day
						and the sun for showing him to me."</p>
					<p>He gained the friendship of Cyrus in the following
						way. He had an intimate friend named Proxenus,
						a Boeotian, a pupil of Gorgias of Leontini and a
						friend of Cyrus. Proxenus, while living in Sardis at
						the court of Cyrus, wrote a letter to Xenophon at
						Athens, inviting him to come and seek the friendship
						of Cyrus. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
						Xenophon showed this letter to Socrates
						and asked his advice, which was that he should go
						to Delphi and consult the oracle. Xenophon complied and came into the presence of the god. He
						inquired, not
						<hi rend='ital'>whether</hi> he should go and seek
						service
						with Cyrus, but
						<hi rend='ital'>in what way</hi> he should do so.
						For
					<pb n='181'/>
					this Socrates blamed him, yet at the same time he
						advised him to go. On his arrival at the court
						of Cyrus he became as warmly attached to him as
						Proxenus himself. We have his own sufficient narrative of all that happened on the expedition and on
						the return home. He was, however, at enmity with
						Meno of Pharsalus, the mercenary general, throughout the expedition, and, by way of abuse, charges

						in the service of Agesilaus, the Spartan king, to
						whom he was devoted beyond measure. About this
						time he was banished by the Athenians for siding
						with Sparta. When he was in Ephesus and had a
						sum of money, he entrusted one half of it to
						Megabyzus, the priest of Artemis, to keep until his
						return, or if he should never return, to apply to the
						erection of a statue in honour of the goddess. But
						the other half he sent in votive offerings to Delphi.
						Next he came to Greece with Agesilaus, who had
						been recalled to carry on the war against Thebes.

					<p>He then left Agesilaus and made his way to Scillus,

					<p>At the same time we are told that Phylopidas the

						slaves from Dardanus, and that he disposed of them
						as he thought fit, and that the Elians marched against
						Scillus, and owing to the slowness of the Spartans
						captured the place, whereupon his sons retired to
						Lepreum with a few of the servants, while Xenophon
						himself, who had previously gone to Elis, went next
						to Lepreum to join his sons, and then made his
						escape with them from Lepreum to Corinth and
						took up his abode there. Meanwhile the Athenians
						passed a decree to assist Sparta, and Xenophon sent

						According to Diocles in his

						Diodorus came safe out of the battle without

						son of the same name (Gryllus) as his brother.
						Gryllus was posted with the cavalry and, in the battle
						which took place about Mantinea, fought stoutly and
						fell, as Ephorus relates in his twenty-fifth book,
						Cephisodorus being in command of the cavalry
					<pb n='185'/>
					and Hegesilaus commander-in-chief. In this battle
						Epaminondas also fell. On this occasion Xenophon
						is said to have been sacrificing, with a chaplet on his
						head, which he removed when his son's death was
						announced. But afterwards, upon learning that he
						had fallen gloriously, he replaced the chaplet on his

						<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
						Some say that he did not even shed tears, but

						in his

						hunting, an able tactician as is clear from his writings,
					<pb n='187'/>
					pious, fond of sacrificing, and an expert in augury
						from the victims; and he made Socrates his exact

					<p>He wrote some forty books in all, though the

					<p>Aeschines was the son of Charinus the sausagemaker, but others make his father's name Lysanias.
						He was a citizen of Athens, industrious from his

						hence Socrates' remark, "Only the sausage-maker's
						son knows how to honour me." Idomeneus declared
					<pb n='191'/>
					that it was Aeschines, not Crito, who advised Socrates
						in the prison about making his escape,<note n='a'>Idomeneus, it may be
							conjectured, relied on some
							Socratic dialogue in which the part assigned by Plato to
							Crito was given to Aeschines.</note> but that
						Plato put the words into the mouth of Crito because
						Aeschines was more attached to Aristippus than to
						himself. It was said maliciously--by Menedemus
						of Eretria in particular--that most of the dialogues
						which Aeschines passed off as his own were really
						dialogues of Socrates obtained by him from Xanthippe. Those of them which are said to have no
						beginning (<foreign lang='greek'>a)ke/faloi</foreign>) are very slovenly
						and show
						none of the vigour of Socrates; Pisistratus of Ephesus
						even denied that they were written by Aeschines.
						<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
						Persaeus indeed attributes the majority of the seven
						to Pasiphon of the school of Eretria, who inserted
						them among the dialogues of Aeschines. Moreover,

						which for that reason is somewhat weak; then

					<p>They say that want drove him to Sicily to the
						court of Dionysius, and that Plato took no notice of
						him, but he was introduced to Dionysius by Aristippus, and on presenting certain dialogues received
						gifts from him. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
						Afterwards on his return to Athens
						he did not venture to lecture owing to the popularity
						of Plato and Aristippus. But he took fees from
						pupils, and subsequently composed forensic speeches
						for aggrieved clients. This is the point of Timon's
						reference to him as "the might of Aeschines, that
						not unconvincing writer." They say that Socrates,
					<pb n='193'/>
					seeing how he was pinched by poverty, advised him
						to borrow from himself by reducing his rations. Aristippus among others had suspicions of the genuineness of his dialogues. At all events, as he was
						reading one at Megara, Aristippus rallied him by
						asking, "Where did you get that, you thief?"</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
					<p>Polycritus of Mende, in the first book of his
						<hi

						return of Dion, and that with him was Carcinus the
						tragic poet. There is also extant an epistle of
						Aeschines to Dionysius. That he had received a
						good rhetorical training is clear from his defence of
						the father of Phaeax the general, and from his
						defence of Dion. He is a close imitator of Gorgias
						of Leontini. Moreover, Lysias attacked him in a
						speech which he entitled "On dishonesty." And
						from this too it is clear that he was a rhetorician.
						A single disciple of his is mentioned, Aristotle, whose
						nickname was "Story."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
					<p>Panaetius thinks that, of all the Socratic dialogues, those by Plato, Xenophon, Antisthenes and

					<p>There are eight men who have borne the name of

					<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
					<p>Aristippus was by birth a citizen of Cyrene and,
						as Aeschines informs us, was drawn to Athens by
						the fame of Socrates. Having come forward as a
						lecturer or sophist, as Phanias of Eresus, the Peripatetic, informs us, he was the first of the followers
						of Socrates to charge fees and to send money to his
						master. And on one occasion the sum of twenty
						minae which he had sent was returned to him,
						Socrates declaring that the supernatural sign would
						not let him take it; the very offer, in fact, annoyed
						him. Xenophon was no friend to Aristippus; and
						for this reason he has made Socrates direct against
						Aristippus the discourse in which he denounces
						pleasure.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Mem.</hi> ii. 1.</note> Not but
						what Theodorus in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Sects</hi> abuses him, and so does Plato in the

							written; see iii. 36.</note> as has been shown elsewhere.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
					<p>He was capable of adapting himself to place, time
						and person, and of playing his part appropriately
						under whatever circumstances. Hence he found
						more favour than anybody else with Dionysius,
						because he could always turn the situation to good
						account. He derived pleasure from what was present,
						and did not toil to procure the enjoyment of something not present Hence Diogenes called him the
						king's poodle<note n='c'>Or "royal cynic." It is impossible to preserve
							the
							<hi rend='ital'>double entendre</hi> here, for
							<foreign lang='greek'>ku/wn,</foreign> dog, also means "cynic";
							in fact the very name of that sect proclaims that they gloried
							in their dog-like attributes, especially in snarling and biting.</note>
						Timon, too, sneered at him for luxury
						in these words<note n='d'>Fr. 27 D.</note>:</p>
					<pb n='197'/>
					<p>Such was the delicate nature of Aristippus, who groped

					<p>He is said to have ordered a partridge to be bought
						at a cost of fifty drachmae, and, when someone censured him, he inquired, "Would not you have given
						an obol for it?" and, being answered in the affirmative, rejoined, "Fifty drachmae are no more to me."
						<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
						And when Dionysius gave him his choice of three
						courtesans, he carried off all three, saying, "Paris
						paid dearly for giving the preference to one out of
						three." And when he had brought them as far as
						the porch, he let them go. To such lengths did he
						go both in choosing and in disdaining. Hence the
						remark of Strato, or by some accounts of Plato,
						"You alone are endowed with the gift to flaunt in
						robes or go in rags." He bore with Dionysius when
						he spat on him, and to one who took him to task he
						replied, "If the fishermen let themselves be drenched
						with sea-water in order to catch a gudgeon, ought I
						not to endure to be wetted with negus in order to
						take a blenny?"</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
					<p>Diogenes, washing the dirt from his vegetables,
						saw him passing and jeered at him in these terms,
						"If you had learnt to make these your diet, you
						would not have paid court to kings," to which his
						rejoinder was, "And if you knew how to associate
						with men, you would not be washing vegetables."
						Being asked what he had gained from philosophy,
						he replied, "The ability to feel at ease in any
						society." Being reproached for his extravagance,
						he said, "If it were wrong to be extravagant, it
						would not be in vogue at the festivals of the gods."</p>
					<pb n='199'/>
					<p>Being once asked what advantage philosophers have,
						he replied, "Should all laws be repealed, we shall
						go on living as we do now." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
						When Dionysius inquired what was the reason that philosophers go to
						rich men's houses, while rich men no longer visit
						philosophers, his reply was that "the one know what
						they need while the other do not." When he was
						reproached by Plato for his extravagance, he inquired, "Do you think Dionysius a good man?"
						and the reply being in the affirmative, "And yet,"
						said he, "he lives more extravagantly than I do.
						So that there is nothing to hinder a man living
						extravagantly and well." To the question how the
						educated differ from the uneducated, he replied,
						"Exactly as horses that have been trained differ
						from untrained horses." One day, as he entered
						the house of a courtesan, one of the lads with him
						blushed, whereupon he remarked, "It is not going
						in that is dangerous, but being unable to go out."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
					<p>Some one brought him a knotty problem with the
						request that he would untie the knot. "Why, you
						simpleton," said he, "do you want it untied, seeing
						that it causes trouble enough as it is?" "It is
						better," he said, "to be a beggar than to be uneducated; the one needs money, the others need to
						be humanized." One day that he was reviled, he
						tried to slip away; the other pursued him, asking,
						"Why do you run away?" "Because," said he,
						"as it is your privilege to use foul language, so it is
						my privilege not to listen." In answer to one who
						remarked that he always saw philosophers at rich
						men's doors, he said, "So, too, physicians are in
						attendance on those who are sick, but no one for that
						reason would prefer being sick to being a physician."</p>
					<pb n='201'/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
					<p>It happened once that he set sail for Corinth and,
						being overtaken by a storm, he was in great consternation. Some one said, "We plain men are not
						alarmed, and are you philosophers turned cowards?"
						To this he replied, "The lives at stake in the two
						cases are not comparable." When some one gave
						himself airs for his wide learning, this is what he
						said: "As those who eat most and take the most
						exercise are not better in health than those who
						restrict themselves to what they require, so too it is
						not wide reading but useful reading that tends to
						excellence." An advocate, having pleaded for him
						and won the case, thereupon put the question,
						"What good did Socrates do you?" "Thus much,"
						was the reply, "that what you said of me in your
						speech was true."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
					<p>He gave his daughter Arete the very best advice,
						training her up to despise excess. He was asked
						by some one in what way his son would be the better
						for being educated. He replied, "If nothing more
						than this, at all events, when in the theatre he
						will not sit down like a stone upon stone." When
						some one brought his son as a pupil, he asked a fee
						of 500 drachmae. The father objected, "For that
						sum I can buy a slave." "Then do so," was the
						reply, "and you will have two." He said that he
						did not take money from his friends for his own
						use, but to teach them upon what objects their
						money should be spent. When he was reproached
						for employing a rhetorician to conduct his case, he
						made reply, "Well, if I give a dinner, I hire a cook."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
					<p>Being once compelled by Dionysius to enunciate
						some doctrine of philosophy, "It would be ludicrous,"
						he said, "that you should learn from me what to
					<pb n='203'/>
					say, and yet instruct me when to say it." At this,
						they say, Dionysius was offended and made him
						recline at the end of the table. And Aristippus
						said, "You must have wished to confer distinction
						on the last place." To some one who boasted of his
						diving, "Are you not ashamed," said he, "to brag
						of that which a dolphin can do?" Being asked on
						one occasion what is the difference between the wise
						man and the unwise, "Strip them both," said he,
						"and send them among strangers and you will know."
						To one who boasted that he could drink a great deal
						without getting drunk, his rejoinder was, "And so
						can a mule."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
					<p>To one who accused him of living with a courtesan,
						he put the question, "Why, is there any difference
						between taking a house in which many people have
						lived before and taking one in which nobody has
						ever lived?" The answer being "No," he continued, "Or again, between sailing in a ship in
						which ten thousand persons have sailed before and
						in one in which nobody has ever sailed?" "There
						is no difference." "Then it makes no difference,"
						said he, "whether the woman you live with has
						lived with many or with nobody." To the accusation that, although he was a pupil of Socrates, he
						took fees, his rejoinder was, "Most certainly I do,
						for Socrates, too, when certain people sent him corn
						and wine, used to take a little and return all the
						rest; and he had the foremost men in Athens for
						his stewards, whereas mine is my slave Eutychides."
						He enjoyed the favours of La&iuml;s, as Sotion states in
						the second book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
						Philosophers.</hi> 
						<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
						To
						those who censured him his defence was, "I have
						Lais, not she me; and it is not abstinence from
					<pb n='205'/>
					pleasures that is best, but mastery over them without
						ever being worsted." to one who reproached him
						with extravagance in catering, he replied, "Wouldn't
						you have bought this if you could have got it for
						three obols?" The answer being in the affirmative,
						"Very well, then," said Aristippus, "I am no longer
						a lover of pleasure, it is you who are a lover of
						money." One day Simus, the steward of Dionysius,
						a Phrygian by birth and a rascally fellow, was showing him costly houses with tesselated pavements,
						when Aristippus coughed up phlegm and spat in his
						face. And on his resenting this he replied, "I could
						not find any place more suitable."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
					<p>When Charondas (or, as others say, Phaedo) inquired, "Who is this who reeks with unguents?"
						he replied, "It is I, unlucky wight, and the still more
						unlucky Persian king. But, as none of the other
						animals are at any disadvantage on that account,
						consider whether it be not the same with man.
						Confound the effeminates who spoil for us the use of
						good perfume." Being asked how Socrates died, he
						answered, "As I would wish to die myself." Polyxenus the sophist once paid him a visit and, after
						having seen ladies present and expensive entertainment, reproached him with it later. After an interval Aristippus asked him, "Can you join us today?" 
						<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
						On the other accepting the invitation,
						Aristippus inquired, "Why, then, did you find fault?
						For you appear to blame the cost and not the entertainment." When his servant was carrying money
						and found the load too heavy--the story is told by
						Bion in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Lectures</hi>--Aristippus cried, "Pour away
						the greater part, and carry no more than you can
						manage." Being once on a voyage, as soon as he
					<pb n='207'/>
					discovered the vessel to be manned by pirates, he
						took out his money and began to count it, and then,
						as if by inadvertence, he let the money fall into
						the sea, and naturally broke out into lamentation.
						Another version of the story attributes to him the
						further remark that it was better for the money to
						perish on account of Aristippus than for Aristippus
						to perish on account of the money. Dionysius once
						asked him what he was come for, and he said it was
						to impart what he had and obtain what he had not.
						<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
						But some make his answer to have been, "When I
						needed wisdom, I went to Socrates; now that I am
						in need of money, I come to you." He used to complain of mankind that in purchasing earthenware
						they made trial whether it rang true, but had no
						regular standard by which to judge life. Others
						attribute this remark to Diogenes. One day Dionysius over the wine commanded everybody to put on
						purple and dance. Plato declined, quoting the line<note n='a'>Eur.
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Bacch.</hi> 836.</note>:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'>I could not stoop to put on women's
						robes.</hi></p>
					<p>Aristippus, however, put on the dress and, as he was
						about to dance, was ready with the repartee:</p>
					<p>Even amid the Bacchic revelry</p>
					<p>True modesty will not be put to shame.<note n='b'><hi
						rend='ital'>ib.</hi> 317.</note></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
					<p>He made a request to Dionysius on behalf of a
						friend and, failing to obtain it, fell down at his feet.
						And when some one jeered at him, he made reply,
						"It is not I who am to blame, but Dionysius who has
						his ears in his feet." He was once staying in Asia
						and was taken prisoner by Artaphernes, the satrap.
						"Can you be cheerful under these circumstances?"
					<pb n='209'/>
					some one asked. "Yes, you simpleton," was the
						reply, "for when should I be more cheerful than
						now that I am about to converse with Artaphernes?"
						Those who went through the ordinary curriculum,
						but in their studies stopped short at philosophy, he
						used to compare to the suitors of Penelope. For
						the suitors won Melantho, Polydora and the rest of
						the handmaidens, but were anything but successful
						in their wooing of the mistress. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
						A similar remark
						is ascribed to Ariston. For, he said, when Odysseus
						went down into the under-world, he saw nearly all
						the dead and made their acquaintance, but he never
						set eyes upon their queen herself.</p>
					<p>Again, when Aristippus was asked what are the
						subjects which handsome boys ought to learn, his
						reply was, "Those which will be useful to them when
						they are grown up." To the critic who censured
						him for leaving Socrates to go to Dionysius, his
						rejoinder was, "Yes, but I came to Socrates for
						education and to Dionysius for recreation." When
						he had made some money by teaching, Socrates
						asked him, "Where did you get so much?" to which
						he replied, "Where you got so little."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
					<p>A courtesan having told him that she was with
						child by him, he replied, "You are no more sure of
						this than if, after running through coarse rushes, you
						were to say you had been pricked by one in particular." Someone accused him of exposing his son
						as if it was not his offspring  Whereupon he replied,
						"Phlegm, too, and vermin we know to be of our
						own begetting, but for all that, because they are
						useless, we cast them as far from us as possible."
						He received a sum of money from Dionysius at the
						same time that Plato carried off a book and, when
					<pb n='211'/>
					he was twitted with this, his reply was,, "Well, I
						want money, Plato wants books." Some one asked
						him why he let himself be refuted by Dionysius.
						"For the same reason," said he, "as the others
						refute him."</p>

					<p>Dionysius met a request of his for money with the

					<p>Having written his life, let me now proceed to
						pass in review the philosophers of the Cyrenaic school
						which sprang from him, although some call themselves followers of Hegesias, others followers of
						Anniceris, others again of Theodorus.<note n='a'>This sentence is a
							sort of preface to the valuable summary of Hedonistic tenets which
							occupies 86-99 under four heads, Aristippus (86-93), Hegesias (93-96),
							Anniceris (96,
							97), and Theodorus (97-99).
							<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> note on i. 19 and
							Epiphanius(Diels,
							<hi rend='ital'>Dox. Gr.</hi> 591). It seems as if the
							sentence
							<foreign lang='greek'>te/los de\</foreign>. . .
							<foreign lang='greek'>a)nadidome/nhn</foreign> ought to follow, not to precede,
							this preface. But before the doctrines comes a list of disciples,
							including
							Hegesias, Anniceris, and Theodorus, whose divergencies from
							Aristippus are noted below. The intrusion of Phaedo and
							the Eretrians at this stage is certainly strange: it looks as
							if Diogenes Laertius jotted down a direction for his own
							future guidance.</note> Not but
						what we shall notice further the pupils of Phaedo,
						the chief of whom were called the school of Eretria.
						<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
						The case stands thus. The disciples of Aristippus
						were his daughter Arete, Aethiops of Ptolemais,<note n='b'>If the city
							was so named after a Ptolemy, it is impossible that one of its citizens could have been contemporary
							with the first Aristippus, the companion of Socrates. Even
							if Aristippus II. was the teacher of Aethiops the difficulty is
							not removed.</note>
					<pb n='217'/>
					and Antipater of Cyrene. The pupil of Arete was
						Aristippus, who went by the name of mother-taught,
						and his pupil was Theodorus, known as the atheist,
						subsequently as "god." Antipater's pupil was
						Epitimides of Cyrene, his was Paraebates, and he
						had as pupils Hegesias, the advocate of suicide, and
						Anniceris, who ransomed Plato.</p>
					<p>Those then who adhered to the teaching of
						Aristippus and were known as Cyrenaics held the
						following opinions. They laid down that there are
						two states, pleasure and pain, the former a smooth,
						the latter a rough motion, and that pleasure does
						not differ from pleasure nor is one pleasure more
						pleasant than another. T
						<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
						he one state is agreeable
						and the other repellent to all living things. However, the bodily pleasure which is the end is, according to Panaetius in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects</hi>, not the
						settled pleasure following the removal of pains, or
						the sort of freedom from discomfort which Epicurus
						accepts and maintains to be the end. They also
						hold that there is a difference between "end" and
						"happiness." Our end is particular pleasure, whereas
						happiness is the sum total of all particular pleasures,
						in which are included both past and future pleasures.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
					<p>Particular pleasure is desirable for its own sake,
						whereas happiness is desirable not for its own sake
						but for the sake of particular pleasures. That
						pleasure is the end is proved by the fact that from
						our youth up we are instinctively attracted to it,
						and, when we obtain it, seek for nothing more,
						and shun nothing so much as its opposite, pain.
						Pleasure is good even if it proceed from the most
						unseemly conduct, as Hippobotus says in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects.</hi> For even if the action be
						irregular,
					<pb n='219'/>
					still, at any rate, the resultant pleasure is desirable
						for its own sake and is good.
						<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
						The removal of
						pain, however, which is put forward in Epicurus,
						seems to them not to be pleasure at all, any more
						than the absence of pleasure is pain. For both
						pleasure and pain they hold to consist in motion,
						whereas absence of pleasure like absence of pain is
						not motion, since painlessness is the condition of one
						who is, as it were, asleep. They assert that some
						people may fail to choose pleasure because their
						minds are perverted; not all mental pleasures and
						pains, however, are derived from bodily counterparts. For instance, we take disinterested delight
						in the prosperity of our country which is as real as
						our delight in our own prosperity. Nor again do they
						admit that pleasure is derived from the memory or
						expectation of good, which was a doctrine of Epicurus.
						<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
						For they assert that the movement affecting the mind
						is exhausted in course of time. Again they hold
						that pleasure is not derived from sight or from
						hearing alone. At all events, we listen with pleasure
						to imitation of mourning, while the reality causes
						pain. They gave the names of absence of pleasure
						and absence of pain to the intermediate conditions.
						However, they insist that bodily pleasures are far
						better than mental pleasures, and bodily pains far
						worse than mental pains, and that this is the reason
						why offenders are punished with the former. For
						they assumed pain to be more repellent, pleasure
						more congenial. For these reasons they paid more
						attention to the body than to the mind. Hence,
						although pleasure is in itself desirable, yet they hold
						that the things which are productive of certain
						pleasures are often of a painful nature, the very
					<pb n='221'/>
					opposite of pleasure; so that to accumulate the
						pleasures which are productive of happiness appears
						to them a most irksome business.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
					<p>They do not accept the doctrine that every wise
						man lives pleasantly and every fool painfully, but
						regard it as true for the most part only. It is
						sufficient even if we enjoy but each single pleasure
						as it comes. They say that prudence is a good,
						though desirable not in itself but on account of its
						consequences; that we make friends from interested
						motives, just as we cherish any part of the body so
						long as we have it; that some of the virtues are
						found even in the foolish; that bodily training contributes to the acquisition of virtue; that the sage
						will not give way to envy or love or superstition,
						since these weaknesses are due to mere empty
						opinion; he will, however, feel pain and fear, these
						being natural affections; 
						<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
						and that wealth too is
						productive of pleasure, though not desirable for its
						own sake.</p>
					<p>They affirm that mental affections can be known,
						but not the objects from which they come; and
						they abandoned the study of nature because of its
						apparent uncertainty, but fastened on logical inquiries because of their utility. But Meleager in his
						second book
						<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophical Opinions</hi>, and Clitomachus in his first book
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects</hi>, affirm that
						they
						maintain Dialectic as well as Physics to be useless,
						since, when one has learnt the theory of good and
						evil, it is possible to speak with propriety, to be free
						from superstition, and to escape the fear of death.
						<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
						They also held that nothing is just or honourable or
						base by nature, but only by convention and custom.
						Nevertheless the good man will be deterred from
					<pb n='223'/>
					wrong-doing by the penalties imposed and the prejudices that it would arouse. Further that the wise
						man really exists. They allow progress to be attainable in philosophy as well as in other matters. They
						maintain that the pain of one man exceeds that of
						another, and that the senses are not always true and
						trustworthy.</p>
					<p>The school of Hegesias, as it is called, adopted the
						same ends, namely pleasure and pain. In their view
						there is no such thing as gratitude or friendship or
						beneficence, because it is not for themselves that we
						choose to do these things but simply from motives
						of interest, apart from which such conduct is nowhere
						found. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
						They denied the possibility of happiness, for
						the body is infected with much suffering, while the
						soul shares in the sufferings of the body and is a
						prey to disturbance, and fortune often disappoints.
						From all this it follows that happiness cannot be
						realized. Moreover, life and death are each desirable
						in turn. But that there is anything naturally
						pleasant or unpleasant they deny; when some men
						are pleased and others pained by the same objects,
						this is owing to the lack or rarity or surfeit of such
						objects. Poverty and riches have no relevance to
						pleasure; for neither the rich nor the poor as such
						have any special share in pleasure. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
						Slavery and
						freedom, nobility and low birth, honour and dishonour, are alike indifferent in a calculation of
						pleasure. To the fool life is advantageous, while to
						the wise it is a matter of indifference. The wise man
						will be guided in all he does by his own interests,
						for there is none other whom he regards as equally
						deserving. For supposing him to reap the greatest
						advantages from another, they would not be equal to
					<pb n='225'/>
					what he contributes himself. They also disallow
						the claims of the senses, because they do not lead
						to accurate knowledge. Whatever appears rational
						should be done. They affirmed that allowance should
						be made for errors, for no man errs voluntarily, but
						under constraint of some suffering; that we should
						not hate men, but rather teach them better. The
						wise man will not have so much advantage over
						others in the choice of goods as in the avoidance of
						evils, making it his end to live without pain of body
						or mind. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
						This then, they say, is the advantage
						accruing to those who make no distinction between
						any of the objects which produce pleasure.</p>
					<p>The school of Anniceris in other respects agreed
						with them, but admitted that friendship and gratitude and respect for parents do exist in real life, and
						that a good man will sometimes act out of patriotic
						motives. Hence, if the wise man receive annoyance,
						he will be none the less happy even if few pleasures
						accrue to him. The happiness of a friend is not in
						itself desirable, for it is not felt by his neighbour.
						Instruction is not sufficient in itself to inspire us
						with confidence and to make us rise superior to the
						opinion of the multitude. Habits must be formed
						because of the bad disposition which has grown up
						in us from the first. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
						A friend should be cherished
						not merely for his utility--for, if that fails, we should
						then no longer associate with him--but for the good
						feeling for the sake of which we shall even endure
						hardships. Nay, though we make pleasure the end
						and are annoyed when deprived of it, we shall
						nevertheless cheerfully endure this because of our
						love to our friend.</p>
					<p>The Theodoreans derived their name from Theo-
					<pb n='227'/>
					dorus, who has already been mentioned, and adopted
						his doctrines. Theodorus was a man who utterly
						rejected the current belief in the gods. And I have
						come across a book of his entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Of the Gods</hi>
						which
						is not contemptible. From that book, they say,
						Epicurus borrowed most of what he wrote on the
						subject.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
					<p>Theodorus was also a pupil of Anniceris and of
						Dionysius the dialectician, as Antisthenes mentions
						in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> He considered
						joy
						and grief to be the supreme good and evil, the one
						brought about by wisdom, the other by folly. Wisdom and justice he called goods, and their opposites
						evils, pleasure and pain being intermediate to good
						and evil. Friendship he rejected because it did not
						exist between the unwise nor between the wise;
						with the former, when the want is removed, the
						friendship disappears, whereas the wise are selfsufficient and have no need of friends. It was
						reasonable, as he thought, for the good man not to
						risk his life in the defence of his country, for he would
						never throw wisdom away to benefit the unwise.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
					<p>He said the world was his country. Theft, adultery,
						and sacrilege would be allowable upon occasion, since
						none of these acts is by nature base, if once you
						have removed the prejudice against them, which is
						kept up in order to hold the foolish multitude
						together. The wise man would indulge his passions
						openly without the least regard to circumstances.
						Hence he would use such arguments as this. "Is
						a woman who is skilled in grammar useful in so far
						as she is skilled in grammar?" "Yes." "And is
						a boy or a youth skilled in grammar useful in so far
						as he is skilled in grammar?" "Yes." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
						"Again,
					<pb n='229'/>
					is a woman who is beautiful useful in so far as she
						is beautiful? And the use of beauty is to be enjoyed?" "Yes." When this was admitted, he
						would press the argument to the conclusion, namely,
						that he who uses anything for the purpose for which
						it is useful does no wrong. And by some such
						interrogatories he would carry his point.</p>
					<p>He appears to have been called
						<foreign lang='greek'>qeo/s</foreign>
						(god) in
						consequence of the following argument addressed to
						him by Stilpo. "Are you, Theodorus, what you
						declare yourself to be?" To this he assented, and
						Stilpo continued, "And do you say you are god?"
						To this he agreed. "Then it follows that you are
						god." Theodorus accepted this, and Stilpo said with
						a smile, "But, you rascal, at this rate you would
						allow yourself to be a jackdaw and ten thousand
						other things."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
					<p>However, Theodorus, sitting on one occasion beside
						Euryclides, the hierophant, began, "Tell me,
						Euryclides, who they are who violate the mysteries?"
						Euryclides replied, "Those who disclose them to the
						uninitiated." "Then you violate them," said Theodorus, "when you explain them to the uninitiated."
						Yet he would hardly have escaped from being brought
						before the Areopagus if Demetrius of Phalerum had
						not rescued him. And Amphicrates in his book
						<hi rend='ital'>Upon
							Illustrious Men</hi> says he was condemned to drink the
							hemlock.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
					<p>For a while he stayed at the court of Ptolemy
						the son of Lagus, and was once sent by him as
						ambassador to Lysimachus. And on this occasion
						his language was so bold that Lysimachus said, "Tell
						me, are you not the Theodorus who was banished
						from Athens?" To which he replied, "Your in-
					<pb n='231'/>
					formation is correct, for, when Athens could not bear
						me any more than Semele could Dionysus, she cast
						me out." And upon Lysimachus adding, "Take
						care you do not come here again," "I never will,"
						said he, "unless Ptolemy sends me." Mithras, the
						king's minister, standing by and saying, "It seems
						that you can ignore not only gods but kings as well,"
						Theodorus replied, "How can you say that I ignore
						the gods when I regard you as hateful to the gods?"
						He is said on one occasion in Corinth to have walked
						abroad with a numerous train of pupils, and Metrocles
						the Cynic, who was washing chervil, remarked, "You,
						sophist that you are, would not have wanted all
						these pupils if you had washed vegetables." Thereupon Theodorus retorted, "And you, if you had
						known how to associate with men, would have had no
						use for these vegetables." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
						A similar anecdote is told
						of Diogenes and Aristippus, as mentioned above.<note n='a'>See
							&sect;68.</note></p>
					<p>Such was the character of Theodorus and his
						surroundings. At last he retired to Cyrene, where
						he lived with Magas and continued to be held in
						high honour. The first time that he was expelled
						from Cyrene he is credited with a witty remark:
						"Many thanks,<note n='b'>Or, if

							<foreign lang='greek'>kalw=s</foreign> is Stephanus's conjecture.</note>
						men of Cyrene," said he, "for driving me from Libya into Greece."</p>
					<p>Some twenty persons have borne the name of
						Theodorus: (1) a Samian, the son of Rhoecus. He
						it was who advised laying charcoal embers under the
						foundations of the temple in Ephesus; for, as the
						ground was very damp, the ashes, being free from
						woody fibre, would retain a solidity which is actually
						proof against moisture. (2) A Cyrenaean geometer,

					<head>Chapter 10. EUCLIDES</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
					<p>Euclides was a native of Megara on the Isthmus,<note n='a'>So called
						to distinguish it from Megara Hyblaea, in
						Sicily.</note>or according to some of Gela, as Alexander states in
						his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> He applied
						himself
						to the writings of Parmenides, and his followers were
						called Megarians after him, then Eristics, and at a
						later date Dialecticians, that name having first been
						given to them by Dionysius of Chalcedon because
						they put their arguments into the form of question
						and answer. Hermodorus tells us that, after the
						death of Socrates, Plato and the rest of the philosophers came to him, being alarmed at the cruelty
						of the tyrants. He held the supreme good to be
						really one, though called by many names, sometimes
						wisdom, sometimes God, and again Mind, and so
						forth. But all that is contradictory of the good he
						used to reject, declaring that it had no existence.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
					<p>When he impugned a demonstration, it was not
						the premisses but the conclusion that he attacked.
						He rejected the argument from analogy, declaring
						that it must be taken either from similars or from
					<pb n='237'/>
					dissimilars. If it were drawn from similars, it is with
						these and not with their analogies that their arguments should deal; if from dissimilars, it is gratuitous

					<p>He wrote six dialogues, entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Lamprias, Aeschines, Phoenix, Crito, Alcibiades,</hi> and a

						of Miletus, the author of many dialectical arguments
						in an interrogatory form, namely,

						Eubulides kept up a controversy with Aristotle and
						said much to discredit him.</p>
					<p>Among other members the school of Eubulides
						included Alexinus of Elis, a man very fond of controversy, for which reason he was called Elenxinus.
						In particular he kept up a controversy with Zeno.
						Hermippus says of him that he left Elis and removed
						to Olympia, where he studied philosophy. His pupils

					told that it was his intention to found a school which
						should be called the Olympian school. But as their
						provisions ran short and they found the place unhealthy, they left it, and for the rest of his days
						Alexinus lived in solitude with a single servant.
						And some time afterwards, as he was swimming in
						the Alpheus, the point of a reed ran into him, and
						of this injury he died.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
					<p>I have composed the following lines upon him<note n='a'><hi

					<p>He has written not only a reply to Zeno but other
						works, including one against Ephorus the historian.</p>
					<p>To the school of Eubulides also belonged Euphantus
						of Olynthus, who wrote a history of his own times.
						He was besides a poet and wrote several tragedies,

							<hi rend='ital'>Cf.

						<hi rend='ital'>On Kingship</hi> which was very popular.
						He died of old age.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
					<p>There are also other pupils of Eubulides, amongst

					<pb n='241'/>
					known as the "Veiled Figure" and the "Horned
						One." When he was staying with Ptolemy Soter,
						he had certain dialectical questions addressed to him
						by Stilpo, and, not being able to solve them on the
						spot, he was reproached by the king and, among
						other slights, the nickname Cronus was applied to
						him by way of derision. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>
						He left the banquet and,

					<p>The successors of Euclides include Ichthyas, the

					<head>Chapter 11. STILPO</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>
					<p>Stilpo, a citizen of Megara in Greece, was a pupil
						of some of the followers of Euclides, although others
						make him a pupil of Euclides himself, and furthermore
						of Thrasymachus of Corinth, who was the friend of
						Ichthyas, according to Heraclides. And so far did
						he excel all the rest in inventiveness and sophistry
						that nearly the whole of Greece was attracted to
					<pb n='243'/>
					him and joined the school of Megara. On this let
						me cite the exact words of Philippus the Megarian
						philosopher: "for from Theophrastus he drew away
						the theorist Metrodorus and Timagoras of Gela,
						from Aristotle the Cyrenaic philosopher, Clitarchus,
						and Simmias; and as for the dialecticians themselves,
						he gained over Paeonius from Aristides; Diphilus of
						Bosphorus, the son of Euphantus, and Myrmex, the
						son of Exaenetus, who had both come to refute him,
						he made his devoted adherents." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
						And besides these
						he won over Phrasidemus the Peripatetic, an accomplished physicist, and Alcimus the rhetorician, the
						first orator in all Greece; Crates, too, and many
						others he got into his toils, and, what is more, along
						with these, he carried off Zeno the Phoenician.</p>
					<p>He was also an authority on politics.</p>
					<p>He married a wife, and had a mistress named
						Nicarete, as Onetor has somewhere stated. He had
						a profligate daughter, who was married to his friend
						Simmias of Syracuse. And, as she would not live
						by rule, some one told Stilpo that she was a disgrace
						to him. To this he replied, "Not so, any more than
						I am an honour to her."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
					<p>Ptolemy Soter, they say, made much of him, and
						when he had got possession of Megara, offered him
						a sum of money and invited him to return with him
						to Egypt. But Stilpo would only accept a very
						moderate sum, and he declined the proposed journey,
						and removed to Aegina until Ptolemy set sail.
						Again, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, had
						taken Megara, he took measures that Stilpo's house
						should be preserved and all his plundered property
						restored to him. But when he requested that a
						schedule of the lost property should be drawn up,
					<pb n='245'/>
					Stilpo denied that he had lost anything which really
					belonged to him, for no one had taken away his learning, while he still had his eloquence and knowledge.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="116"/>
					<p>And conversing upon the duty of doing good to
						men he made such an impression on the king that
						he became eager to hear him. There is a story that
						he once used the following argument concerning the
						Athena of Phidias: "Is it not Athena the daughter
						of Zeus who is a goddess?" And when the other
						said "Yes," he went on, "But this at least is not
						by Zeus but by Phidias," and, this being granted,
						he concluded, "This then is not a god." For this
						he was summoned before the Areopagus; he did
						not deny the charge, but contended that the reasoning was correct, for that Athena was no god but a
						goddess; it was the male divinities who were gods.
						However, the story goes that the Areopagites ordered
						him to quit the city, and that thereupon Theodorus,
						whose nickname was
						<foreign lang='greek'>*qeo/s</foreign>, said in
						derision, "Whence
						did Stilpo learn this? and how could he tell whether
						she was a god or a goddess?" But in truth Theodorus was most impudent, and Stilpo most ingenious.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="117"/>
					<p>When Crates asked him whether the gods take
						delight in prayers and adorations, he is said to have
						replied, "Don't put such a question in the street,
						simpleton, but when we are alone!" It is said that
						Bion, when he was asked the same question whether
						there are gods, replied:</p>
					<p>Will you not scatter the crowd from me, O much-enduring
						elder?</p>
					<p>In character Stilpo was simple and unaffected, and
						he could readily adapt himself to the plain man.
						For instance, when Crates the Cynic did not answer
						the question put to him and only insulted the ques-
					<pb n='247'/>
					tioner, "I knew," said Stilpo, "that you would utter
						anything rather than what you ought." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
						And once
						when Crates held out a fig to him when putting a
						question, he took the fig and ate it. Upon which
						the other exclaimed, "O Heracles, I have lost the
						fig," and Stilpo remarked, "Not only that but your
						question as well, for which the fig was payment in
						advance." Again, on seeing Crates shrivelled with
						cold in the winter, he said, "You seem to me, Crates,
						to want a new coat,"
						<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> to be wanting in sense
						as
						well.<note n='a'>The pun upon
							<foreign lang='greek'>kainou=</foreign>
							("new") and
							<foreign lang='greek'>kai\ nou=</foreign> ("mind as
							well") recurs vi. 3.</note> And the other being annoyed replied with
						the following burlesque<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi>
							Add. v. 13 b.</note>:</p>
					<p>And Stilpo I saw enduring toilsome woes in Megara,
						where men say that the bed of Typhos is. There he would
						ever be wrangling, and many comrades about him, wasting
						time in the verbal pursuit of virtue.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
					<p>It is said that at Athens he so attracted the public
						that people would run together from the workshops
						to look at him. And when some one said, "Stilpo,
						they stare at you as if you were some strange creature." "No, indeed," said he, "but as if I were a
						genuine man." And, being a consummate master
						of controversy, he used to demolish even the ideas,
						and say that he who asserted the existence of Man
						meant no individual; he did not mean this man or
						that. For why should he mean the one more than
						the other? Therefore neither does he mean this
						individual man. Again, "vegetable" is not what
						is shown to me, for vegetable existed ten thousand
						years ago. Therefore this is not vegetable. The
						story goes that while in the middle of an argument
						with Crates he hurried off to buy fish, and, when
						Crates tried to detain him and urged that he was
						leaving the argument, his answer was, "Not I. I
					<pb n='249'/>
					keep the argument though I am leaving you; for
						the argument will remain, but the fish will soon be
						sold."</p>

					<head>Chapter 17. MENEDEMUS</head>
					<p>Menedemus belonged to Phaedo's school; he was
						the son of Clisthenes, a member of the clan called
						the Theopropidae, of good family, though a builder
						and a poor man; others say that he was a scenepainter and that Menedemus learnt both trades.
						Hence, when he had proposed a decree, a certain
						Alexinius attacked him, declaring that the philosopher
						was not a proper person to design either a scene or
						a decree. When Menedemus was dispatched by
						the Eretrians to Megara on garrison duty, he paid
						a visit to Plato at the Academy and was so captivated
						that he abandoned the service of arms. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="126"/>
						Asclepiades
						of Phlius drew him away, and he lived at Megara
						with Stilpo, whose lectures they both attended.</p>
					<pb n='259'/>
					<p>Thence they sailed to Elis, where they joined
						Anchipylus and Moschus of the school of Phaedo.
						Down to their time, as was stated in the Life of
						Phaedo, the school was called the Elian school.
						Afterwards it was called the Eretrian school, from
						the city to which my subject belonged.</p>
					<p>It would appear that Menedemus was somewhat
						pompous. Hence Crates burlesques him thus<note n='a'>Fr. 2
							D.</note>:</p>
					<p>Asclepiades the sage of Phlius and the Eretrian bull;</p>
					<p>and Timon as follows<note n='b'>Fr. 29 D.</note>:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'>A puffing, supercilious purveyor of
					humbug.</hi></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>
					<p>He was a man of such dignity that, when Eurylochus of Casandrea was invited by Antigonus to
						court along with Cle&iuml;ppides, a youth of Cyzicus, he
						declined the invitation, being afraid that Menedemus
						would hear of it, so caustic and outspoken was he.
						When a young gallant would have taken liberties
						with him, he said not a word but picked up a twig
						and drew an insulting picture on the ground, until
						all eyes were attracted and the young man, perceiving the insult, made off. When Hierocles, who
						was in command of the Piraeus, walked up and
						down along with him in the shrine of Amphiaraus,
						and talked much of the capture of Eretria, he made
						no other reply beyond asking him what Antigonus's
						object was in treating him as he did.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>
					<p>To an adulterer who was giving himself airs he
						said, "Do you not know that, if cabbage has a good
						flavour, so for that matter has radish?" Hearing
						a youth who was very noisy, he said, "See what
						there is behind you." When Antigonus consulted
						him as to whether he should go to a rout, he sent
					<pb n='261'/>
					a message to say no more than this, that he was the
						son of a king. When a stupid fellow related something to him with no apparent object, he inquired
						if he had a farm. And hearing that he had, and
						that there was a large stock of cattle on it, he said,
						"Then go and look after them, lest it should happen
						that they are ruined and a clever farmer thrown
						away." To one who inquired if the good man ever
						married, he replied, "Do you think me good or
						not?" The reply being in the affirmative, he said,
						"Well, I am married." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="129"/>
						Of one who affirmed that
						there were many good things, he inquired how many,
						and whether he thought there were more than a
						hundred. Not being able to curb the extravagance
						of some one who had invited him to dinner, he said
						nothing when he was invited, but rebuked his host
						tacitly by confining himself to olives. However, on
						account of this freedom of speech he was in great
						peril in Cyprus with his friend Asclepiades when
						staying at the court of Nicocreon. For when the
						king held the usual monthly feast and invited these
						two along with the other philosophers, we are told
						that Menedemus said that, if the gathering of such
						men was a good thing, the feast ought to have been
						held every day; if not, then it was superfluous even
						on the present occasion. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="130"/>
						The tyrant having replied
						to this by saying that on this day he had the
						leisure to hear philosophers, he pressed the point
						still more stubbornly, declaring, while the feast was
						going on, that any and every occasion should be
						employed in listening to philosophers. The consequence was that, if a certain flute-player had not
						got them away, they would have been put to death.
						Hence when they were in a storm in the boat
					<pb n='263'/>
					Asclepiades is reported to have said that the fluteplayer through good playing had proved their salvation when the free speech of Menedemus had been
						their undoing.</p>
					<p>He shirked work, it is said, and was indifferent to
						the fortunes of his school. At least no order could be
						seen in his classes, and no circle of benches; but each
						man would listen where he happened to be, walking or
						sitting, Menedemus himself behaving in the same way.
						<milestone unit="section" n="131"/>
						In other respects he is said to have been nervous and
						careful of his reputation; so much so that, when
						Menedemus himself and Asclepiades were helping
						a man who had formerly been a builder to build a
						house, whereas Asclepiades appeared stripped on the
						roof passing the mortar, Menedemus would try to
						hide himself as often as he saw anyone coming.
						After he took part in public affairs, he was so nervous
						that, when offering the frankincense, he would
						actually miss the censer. And once, when Crates
						stood about him and attacked him for meddling in
						politics, he ordered certain men to have Crates
						locked up. But Crates none the less watched him
						as he went by and, standing on tiptoe, called him a
						pocket Agamemnon and Hegesipolis.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="132"/>
					<p>He was also in a way rather superstitious. At all
						events once, when he was at an inn with Asclepiades
						and had inadvertently eaten some meat which had
						been thrown away, he turned sick and pale when he
						learnt the fact, until Asclepiades rebuked him, saying
						that it was not the meat which disturbed him but
						merely his suspicion of it. In all other respects he
						was magnanimous and liberal. In his habit of body,
						even in old age, he was as firm and sunburnt in
						appearance as any athlete, being stout and always
					<pb n='265'/>
					in the pink of condition; in stature he was wellproportioned, as may be seen from the statuette in
						the ancient Stadium at Eretria. For it represents
						him, intentionally no doubt, almost naked, and displays the greater part of his body.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="133"/>
					<p>He was fond of entertaining and used to collect
						numerous parties about him because Eretria was
						unhealthy; amongst these there would be parties of
						poets and musicians. He welcomed Aratus also and
						Lycophron the tragic poet, and Antagoras of Rhodes,
						but, above all, he applied himself to the study of
						Homer and, next, the Lyric poets; then to Sophocles,
						and also to Achaeus, to whom he assigned the second
						place as a writer of satiric dramas, giving Aeschylus
						the first. Hence he quoted against his political
						opponents the following lines<note n='a'>Nauck,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Achaeus</hi>, 34.</note>:</p>
					<p>Ere long the swift is overtaken by the feeble,</p>
					<p>And the eagle by the tortoise,</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>
					<p>which are from the
						<hi rend='ital'>Omphale</hi>, a satiric drama of
						Achaeus. Therefore it is a mistake to say that he
						had read nothing except the
						<hi rend='ital'>Medea</hi> of Euripides,
						which some have asserted to be the work of Neophron
						of Sicyon.</p>
					<p>He despised the teachers of the school of Plato
						and Xenocrates as well as the Cyrenaic philosopher
						Paraebates. He had a great admiration for Stilpo;
						and on one occasion, when he was questioned about
						him, he made no other answer than that he was a
						gentleman. Menedemus was difficult to see through,
						and in making a bargain it was difficult to get the
						better of him. He would twist and turn in every
						direction, and he excelled in inventing objections.
						He was a great controversialist, according to Anti-
					<pb n='267'/>
					sthenes in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> In
						particular he was fond of using the following argument:
						"Is the one of two things different from the other?"
						"Yes." "And is conferring benefits different from
						the good?" "Yes." "Then to confer benefits is
						not good."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="135"/>
					<p>It is said that he disallowed negative propositions,
						converting them into affirmatives, and of these he
						admitted simple propositions only, rejecting those
						which are not simple, I mean hypothetical and
						complex propositions. Heraclides declares that,
						although in his doctrines he was a Platonist, yet he
						made sport of dialectic. So that, when Alexinus
						once inquired if he had left off beating his father, his
						answer was, "Why, I was not beating him and have
						not left off"; and upon Alexinus insisting that he
						ought to have cleared up the ambiguity by a plain
						"Yes" or "No," "It would be absurd," he said,
						"for me to conform to your rules when I can stop
						you on the threshold." And when Bion persistently
						ran down the soothsayers, Menedemus said he was
						slaying the slain.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>
					<p>On hearing some one say that the greatest good
						was to get all you want, he rejoined, "To want the
						right things is a far greater good." Antigonus of
						Carystus asserts that he never wrote or composed
						anything, and so never held firmly by any doctrine.
						He adds that in discussing questions he was so
						pugnacious that he would only retire after he had
						been badly mauled. And yet, though he was so
						violent in debate, he was as mild as possible in his
						conduct. For instance, though he made sport of
						Alexinus and bantered him cruelly, he was nevertheless very kind to him, for, when his wife was afraid
					<pb n='269'/>
					that on her journey she might be set upon and
					robbed, he gave her an escort from Delphi to Chalcis.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n=""/>
					<p>He was a very warm friend, as is shown by his
						affection for Asclepiades, which was hardly inferior
						to the devotion shown by Pylades. But, Asclepiades
						being the elder, it was said that he was the playwright and Menedemus the actor. They say that
						once, when Archipolis had given them a cheque for
						half a talent, they stickled so long over the point as
						to whose claim came second that neither of them
						got the money. It is said that they married a
						mother and her daughter; Asclepiades married the
						daughter and Menedemus the mother. But after
						the death of his own wife, Asclepiades took the wife
						of Menedemus; and afterwards the latter, when he
						became head of the state, married a rich woman as
						his second wife.  Nevertheless, as they kept one
						household, Menedemus entrusted his former wife
						with the care of his establishment.

						However,

						they had ample means. Some time afterwards a
						favourite of Asclepiades, having come to a party
						and being refused admittance by the pupils,
						Menedemus ordered them to admit him, saying
						that even now, when under the earth, Asclepiades
						opened the door for him. It was Hipponicus the
						Macedonian and Agetor of Lamia who were their
						chief supporters; the one gave each of the two

					<p>He used to give his parties in this fashion: he
						would breakfast beforehand with two or three friends
						and stay until it was late in the day. And in the
						next place some one would summon the guests who
						had arrived and who had themselves already dined,
						so that, if anyone came too soon, he would walk up
						and down and inquire from those who came out of
						the house what was on the table and what o'clock
						it was. If then it was only vegetables or salt fish,
						they would depart; but if there was meat, they
						would enter the house. In the summer time a rush
						mat was put upon each couch, in winter time a sheepskin. The guest brought his own cushion. The
						loving-cup which was passed round was no larger
						than a pint cup. The dessert consisted of lupins or
						beans, sometimes of ripe fruit such as pears, pomegranates, a kind of pulse, or even dried figs. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="140"/>
						All of
						these facts are mentioned by Lycophron in his
						satiric drama entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Menedemus</hi>, which was composed as a tribute to him. Here is a specimen of it<note n='a'>Nauck,
							<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi> p. 818.</note>:</p>
					<p>And after a temperate feast the modest cup was passed

					<p>At first he was despised, being called a cynic and
						a humbug by the Eretrians. But afterwards he was
						greatly admired, so much so that they entrusted him
						with the government of the state. He was sent as
						envoy to Ptolemy and to Lysimachus, being honoured
						wherever he went. He was, moreover, envoy to
						Demetrius, and he caused the yearly tribute of
						two hundred talents which the city used to pay
						Demetrius to be reduced by fifty talents. And
						when he was accused to Demetrius of intriguing
						to hand over the city to Ptolemy, he defended
					<pb n='273'/>
					himself in a letter which commences thus: 
						<milestone unit="section" n="141"/>
					"Menedemus to King Demetrius, greeting. I hear that
						a report has reached you concerning me." There
						is a tradition that one Aeschylus who belonged
						to the opposite party had made these charges against
						him. He seems to have behaved with the utmost
						dignity in the embassy to Demetrius on the subject
						of Oropus, as Euphantus relates in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Histories.</hi>
						Antigonus too was much attached to him and used to
						proclaim himself his pupil. And when he vanquished
						the barbarians near the town of Lysimachia, Menedemus moved a decree in his honour in simple terms
						and free from flattery, beginning thus: 
						<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>
						"On the
						motion of the generals and the councillors--Whereas
						King Antigonus is returning to his own country after
						vanquishing the barbarians in battle, and whereas
						in all his undertakings he prospers according to his
						will, the senate and the people have decreed . . ."</p>
					<p>On these grounds, then, and from his friendship for
						him in other matters, he was suspected of betraying
						the city to Antigonus, and, being denounced by
						Aristodemus, withdrew from Eretria and stayed
						awhile in Oropus in the temple of Amphiaraus.
						And, because some golden goblets were missing
						from the temple, he was ordered to depart by a
						general vote of the Boeotians, as is stated by
						Hermippus; and thereupon in despair, after a secret
						visit to his native city, he took with him his wife
						and daughters and came to the court of Antigonus,
						where he died of a broken heart.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="143"/>
					<p>Heraclides tells quite another story, that he was
						made councillor of the Eretrians and more than once
						saved the city from a tyranny by calling in Demetrius
						--so then he would not be likely to betray the city
					<pb n='275'/>
					to Antigonus, but was made the victim of a false
						charge; that he betook himself to Antigonus and
						was anxious to regain freedom for his country;
						that, as Antigonus would not give way, in despair
						he put an end to his life by abstaining from food for
						seven days. The account of Antigonus of Carystus
						is similar.<note n='a'>Antigonus of Carystus (see Introd. p. xxiii) is
							the older
							authority, from whom Heraclides (probably Heraclides
							Lembos) directly or indirectly derived his information.</note> With
						Persaeus alone he carried on open
						warfare, for it was thought that, when Antigonus
						was willing for Menedemus's sake to restore to the
						Eretrians their democracy, Persaeus prevented him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="144"/>
						Hence on one occasion over the wine Menedemus
						refuted Persaeus in argument and said, amongst
						other things, "Such he is as a philosopher but, as
						a man, the worst of all that are alive or to be born
						hereafter."</p>
					<p>According to the statement of Heraclides he died
						in his seventy-fourth year. I have written the
						following epigram upon him<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi>
							v. 40.</note>:</p>
					<p>I heard of your fate, Menedemus, how, of your own free
						will, you expired by starving yourself for seven days, a
						deed right worthy of an Eretrian, but unworthy of a man;
						but despair was your leader and urged you on.</p>
					<p>These then are the disciples of Socrates or their
						immediate successors. We must now pass to Plato,
						the founder of the Academy, and his successors, so
						far as they were men of reputation.</p>

					<p>Plato was the son of Ariston and a citizen of Athens.
						His mother was Perictione (or Potone), who traced
						back her descent to Solon. For Solon had a brother,
						Dropides; he was the father of Critias, who was the
						father of Callaeschrus, who was the father of Critias,
						one of the Thirty, as well as of Glaucon, who was the
						father of Charmides and Perictione. Thus Plato,
						the son of this Perictione and Ariston, was in the
						sixth generation from Solon. And Solon traced his
						descent to Neleus and Poseidon. His father too is
						said to be in the direct line from Codrus, the son of
						Melanthus, and, according to Thrasylus, Codrus and
						Melanthus also trace their descent from Poseidon.</p>

						whereupon he left her unmolested until her child
						was born.</p>
					<p>Apollodorus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> fixes the date of

						Neanthes, however, makes him

						in Aegina, in the house of Phidiades, the son of
						Thales, as Favorinus states in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
							History</hi>, for his father had been sent along with
						others to Aegina to settle in the island, but returned
						to Athens when the Athenians were expelled by the
						Lacedaemonians, who championed the Aeginetan
						cause. That Plato acted as choregus at Athens, the
						cost being defrayed by Dion, is stated by Athenodorus in the eighth book of a work entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Walks.</hi>
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
						He had two brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and

					<p>He was taught letters in the school of Dionysius,
						who is mentioned by him in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Rivals.</hi> And he
						learnt gymnastics under Ariston, the Argive wrestler.
						And from him he received the name of Plato on
						account of his robust figure, in place of his original
						name which was Aristocles, after his grandfather, as
						Alexander informs us in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of

						But others affirm that he got the name Plato from
						the breadth of his style, or from the breadth of his

					<pb n='281'/>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					and that he applied himself to painting and wrote
						poems, first dithyrambs, afterwards lyric poems and
						tragedies. He had, they say, a weak voice; this is
						confirmed by Timotheus the Athenian in his book
						<hi rend='ital'>On Lives.</hi> It is stated that Socrates in a dream
						saw
						a cygnet on his knees, which all at once put forth
						plumage, and flew away after uttering a loud sweet
						note. And the next day Plato was introduced as a
						pupil, and thereupon he recognized in him the swan

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<p>From that time onward, having reached his twentieth
						year (so it is said), he was the pupil of Socrates.
						When Socrates was gone, he attached himself to
						Cratylus the Heraclitean, and to Hermogenes who
						professed the philosophy of Parmenides. Then at
						the age of twenty-eight, according to Hermodorus,
						he withdrew to Megara to Euclides, with certain
						other disciples of Socrates. Next he proceeded to
						Cyrene on a visit to Theodorus the mathematician,
						thence to Italy to see the Pythagorean philosophers
						Philolaus and Eurytus, and thence to Egypt to see
					<pb n='283'/>
					those who interpreted the will of the gods; and
						Euripides is said to have accompanied him thither.
						There he fell sick and was cured by the priests, who
						treated him with sea-water, and for this reason he
						cited the line<note n='a'>Eur.
							<hi rend='ital'>Iph. T.</hi>
							1193.</note>:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'>The sea doth wash away all human ills.</hi></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					<p>Furthermore he said that, according to Homer,<note n='b'><hi
						rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv. 231.</note>
						beyond all men the Egyptians were skilled in healing.
						Plato also intended to make the acquaintance of the
						Magians, but was prevented by the wars in Asia.
						Having returned to Athens, he lived in the Academy,
						which is a gymnasium outside the walls, in a grove
						named after a certain hero, Hecademus, as is stated
						by Eupolis in his play entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Shirkers</hi><note
							n='c'>Meineke,
							<hi rend='ital'>C.G.F.</hi> ii. 437. According to Suidas,

					<p><hi rend='center'>In the shady walks of the divine
						Hecademus.</hi></p>
					<p>Moreover, there are verses of Timon which refer to
						Plato<note n='d'>Fr. 30 D.</note>:</p>
					<p>Amongst all of them Plato was the leader, a big fish, but
						a sweet-voiced speaker, musical in prose as the cicala who,
						perched on the trees of Hecademus, pours forth a strain as
						delicate as a lily.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					<p>Thus the original name of the place was Hecademy,
						spelt with
						<hi rend='ital'>e.</hi> Now Plato was a friend of Isocrates.
						And Praxiphanes makes them converse about poets
						at a country-seat where Plato was entertaining
						Isocrates. And Aristoxenus asserts that he went
						on service three times, first to Tanagra, secondly
						to Corinth, and thirdly at Delium, where also he
						obtained the prize of valour. He mixed together
						doctrines of Heraclitus, the Pythagoreans and
					<pb n='285'/>
					Socrates. In his doctrine of sensible things he
						agrees with Heraclitus, in his doctrine of the intelligible with Pythagoras, and in political philosophy
						with Socrates.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
					<p>Some authorities, amongst them Satyrus, say that
						he wrote to Dion in Sicily instructing him to purchase three Pythagorean books from Philolaus for
						100 minae. For they say he was well off, having
						received from Dionysius over eighty talents. This
						is stated by Onetor in an essay upon the theme,
						"Whether a wise man will make money." Further,
						he derived great assistance from Epicharmus the
						Comic poet, for he transcribed a great deal from
						him, as Alcimus says in the essays dedicated to
						Amyntas, of which there are four. In the first of
						them he writes thus:</p>
					<p>"It is evident that Plato often employs the words
						of Epicharmus.<note n='a'>The genuineness of these fragments is doubted
							by
							Wilamowitz, Rohde, and others; see Wilamowitz,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Platon</hi>,
							ii. 28 note 2, and on the other side Diels, note
							<hi rend='ital'>ad
								loc.</hi> (<hi rend='ital'>Frag.
									der Vorsok.</hi> 13 B. 1-5).</note> Just consider. Plato asserts that
						the object of sense is that which never abides in
						quality or quantity, but is ever in flux and change.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
						The assumption is that the things from which you
						take away number are no longer equal nor determinate, nor have they quantity or quality. These
						are the things to which becoming always, and being
						never, belongs. But the object of thought is something constant from which nothing is subtracted, to
						which nothing is added. This is the nature of the
						eternal things, the attribute of which is to be ever
						alike and the same. And indeed Epicharmus has
						expressed himself plainly about objects of sense and
						objects of thought.</p>
					<p>a. But gods there always were; never at any time were
						they wanting, while things in this world are always alike,
						and are brought about through the same agencies.</p>
					<pb n='287'/>
					<p>b. Yet it is said that Chaos was the first-born of the
						gods.</p>
					<p>a. How so? If indeed there was nothing out of which,
						or into which, it could come first.</p>
					<p>b. What! Then did nothing come first after all?</p>
					<p>a. No, by Zeus, nor second either, 
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
						at least of the things
						which we are thus talking about now; on the contrary, they
						existed from all eternity. . . .</p>
					<p>a. But suppose some one chooses to add a single pebble
						to a heap containing either an odd or an even number,
						whichever you please, or to take away one of those already
						there; do you think the number of pebbles would remain
						the same?</p>
					<p>b. Not I.</p>
					<p>a. Nor yet, if one chooses to add to a cubit-measure
						another length,<note n='a'>Or, reading
							<foreign lang='greek'>sterro/n</foreign> for
							<foreign lang='greek'>e(/teron,</foreign> "a substantial length."</note> or cut off
						some of what was there already,
						would the original measure still exist?</p>
					<p>b. Of course not.</p>
					<p>a. Now consider mankind in this same way. One man
						grows, and another again shrinks; and they are all undergoing change the whole time. But a thing which naturally
						changes and never remains in the same state must ever be
						different from that which has thus changed. And even so
						you and I were one pair of men yesterday, are another
						to-day, and again will be another to-morrow, and will never
						remain ourselves, by this same argument."</p>
					<pb n='289'/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
					<p>Again, Alcimus makes this further statement:
						"There are some things, say the wise, which the
						soul perceives through the body, as in seeing and
						hearing; there are other things which it discerns by
						itself without the aid of the body. Hence it follows
						that of existing things some are objects of sense and
						others objects of thought. Hence Plato said that, if
						we wish to take in at one glance the principles
						underlying the universe, we must first distinguish
						the ideas by themselves, for example, likeness, unity
						and plurality, magnitude, rest and motion; next we
						must assume the existence of 
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
						beauty, goodness,
						justice and the like, each existing in and for itself;
						in the third place we must see how many of the
						ideas are relative to other ideas, as are knowledge,
						or magnitude, or ownership, remembering that the
						things within our experience bear the same names
						as those ideas because they partake of them; I
						mean that things which partake of justice are just,
						things which partake of beauty are beautiful. Each
						one of the ideas is eternal, it is a notion, and moreover is incapable of change. Hence Plato says that
						they stand in nature like archetypes, and that all
						things else bear a resemblance to the ideas because
						they are copies of these archetypes. Now here are
						the words of Epicharmus about the good and about
						the ideas:</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
					<p>a. Is flute-playing a thing?</p>
					<p>b. Most certainly.</p>
					<p>a. Is man then flute-playing?</p>
					<p>b. By no means.</p>
					<p>a. Come, let me see, what is a flute-player? Whom do
						you take him to be? Is he not a man?</p>
					<p>b. Most certainly.</p>
					<p>a. Well, don't you think the same would be the case with
					<pb n='291'/>
					the good? Is not the good in itself a thing? And does not
						he who has learnt that thing and knows it at once become
						good? For, just as he becomes a flute-player by learning
						flute-playing, or a dancer when he has learnt dancing, or a
						plaiter when he has learnt plaiting, in the same way, if he
						has learnt anything of the sort, whatever you like, he would
						not be one with the craft but he would be the craftsman.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
					<p>Now Plato in conceiving his theory of Ideas says<note n='a'><hi
						rend='ital'>Cf. Phaedo</hi>, 96 b "(I considered) whether it is blood or
						air or fire with which we think, or none of these things, but
						the brain which furnishes the senses of hearing and sight
						and smell, and from these arise memory and opinion, and
						from memory and opinion, when they have become stable, in
						the same way knowledge arises."</note>:
						Since there is such a thing as memory, there must
						be ideas present in things, because memory is of
						something stable and permanent, and nothing is
						permanent except the ideas. `For how,' he says,
						`could animals have survived unless they had apprehended the idea and had been endowed by Nature
						with intelligence to that end? As it is, they remember similarities and what their food is like,
						which shows that animals have the innate power of
						discerning what is similar. And hence they perceive others of their own kind.' How then does
						Epicharmus put it?</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
					<p>Wisdom is not confined, Eumaeus, to one kind alone, but
						all living creatures likewise have understanding. For, if
						you will study intently the hen among poultry, she does not
						bring forth the chicks alive, but sits clucking on the eggs
						and wakens life in them. As for this wisdom of hers, the
						true state of the case is known to Nature alone, for the hen
						has learnt it from herself.</p>
					<p>And again:</p>
					<p>It is no wonder then that we talk thus and are pleased
						with ourselves and think we are fine folk. For a dog
						appears the fairest of things to a dog, an ox to an ox, an
						ass to an ass, and verily a pig to a pig."</p>
					<pb n='293'/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<p>These and the like instances Alcimus notes through
						four books, pointing out the assistance derived by
						Plato from Epicharmus. That Epicharmus himself
						was fully conscious of his wisdom can also be seen
						from the lines in which he foretells that he will have
						an imitator<note n='a'>This fragment (Fr. 6 D.), which has not the
							authority
							of Alcimus, is generally condemned as spurious.</note>:</p>
					<p>And as I think--for when I think anything I know it full
						well--that my words will some day be remembered; some
						one will take them and free them from the metre in which
						they are now set, nay, will give them instead a purple robe,
						embroidering it with fine phrases; and, being invincible, he
						will make every one else an easy prey.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
					<p>Plato, it seems, was the first to bring to Athens
						the mimes of Sophron which had been neglected,
						and to draw characters in the style of that writer;
						a copy of the mimes, they say, was actually found
						under his pillow. He made three voyages to Sicily,
						the first time to see the island and the craters of
						Etna: on this occasion Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, being on the throne, forced him to become
						intimate with him. But when Plato held forth on
						tyranny and maintained that the interest of the
						ruler alone was not the best end, unless he were
						also pre-eminent in virtue, he offended Dionysius,
						who in his anger exclaimed, "You talk like an old
						dotard." "And you like a tyrant," rejoined Plato.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
						At this the tyrant grew furious and at first was bent
						on putting him to death; then, when he had been
						dissuaded from this by Dion and Aristomenes, he
						did not indeed go so far but handed him over to
						Pollis the Lacedaemonian, who had just then arrived
						on an embassy, with orders to sell him into slavery.</p>
					<pb n='295'/>
					<p>And Pollis took him to Aegina and there offered him
						for sale. And then Charmandrus, the son of Charmandrides, indicted him on a capital charge according
						to the law in force among the Aeginetans, to the
						effect that the first Athenian who set foot upon the
						island should be put to death without a trial. This
						law had been passed by the prosecutor himself,
						according to Favorinus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
							History.</hi>
						But when some one urged, though in jest, that the
						offender was a philosopher, the court acquitted him.
						There is another version to the effect that he was
						brought before the assembly and, being kept under
						close scrutiny, he maintained an absolute silence and
						awaited the issue with confidence. The assembly
						decided not to put him to death but to sell him just
						as if he were a prisoner of war.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
					<p>Anniceris the Cyrenaic happened to be present
						and ransomed him for twenty minae--according to
						others the sum was thirty minae--and dispatched
						him to Athens to his friends, who immediately remitted the money. But Anniceris declined it, saying
						that the Athenians were not the only people worthy
						of the privilege of providing for Plato. Others assert
						that Dion sent the money and that Anniceris would
						not take it, but bought for Plato the little garden
						which is in the Academy. Pollis, however, is stated
						to have been defeated by Chabrias and afterwards to
						have been drowned at Helice,<note n='a'>In the tidal wave which

						Dionysius, indeed, could not rest. On learning the

						leisure to keep Dionysius in his mind.</p>
					<pb n='297'/>
					<p>The second time he visited the younger Dionysius,
						requesting of him lands and settlers for the realization of his republic. Dionysius promised them but
						did not keep his word. Some say that Plato was
						also in great danger, being suspected of encouraging
						Dion and Theodotas in a scheme for liberating the
						whole island; on this occasion Archytas the Pythagorean wrote to Dionysius, procured his pardon, and
						got him conveyed safe to Athens. The letter runs
						as follows:</p>
					<p>"Archytas to Dionysius, wishing him good health.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
					<p>"We, being all of us the friends of Plato, have

					<p>The third time he came to reconcile Dion and

					<pb n='299'/>
					<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> says that the Arcadians and

						and that, on this occasion, as he was going up to the

						duty for a friend."</p>
					<p>He was the first to introduce argument by means

						says that, on his going to Olympia, the eyes of all
					<pb n='301'/>
					the Greeks were turned towards him, and there he
						met Dion, who was about to make his expedition

					<p>This, they say, was actually inscribed upon his tomb

					<p>Now, when Alexis is of no account, I have said no more

					<p>Further, Molon, being his enemy, said, "It is not

						At any rate, they have written similar narratives as

						<hi rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>,
						a
					<pb n='309'/>
					<hi rend='ital'>Defence of Socrates</hi>, and their moral treatises

						Socrates, neither of them refers to the other, except
						that Xenophon mentions Plato in the third book of
						his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia.</hi> 
						<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
						It is said also that Antisthenes,
						being about to read publicly something that he had
						composed, invited Plato to be present. And on his
						inquiring what he was about to read, Antisthenes
						replied that it was something about the impossibility
						of contradiction. "How then," said Plato, "can
						you write on this subject?" thus showing him that
						the argument refutes itself. Thereupon he wrote a
						dialogue against Plato and entitled it
						<hi rend='ital'>Sathon.</hi>
						After
						this they continued to be estranged from one another.
						They say that, on hearing Plato read the
						<hi rend='ital'>Lysis</hi>,
						Socrates exclaimed, "By Heracles, what a number
						of lies this young man is telling about me!" For
						he has included in the dialogue much that Socrates
						never said.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
					<p>Plato was also on bad terms with Aristippus. At
						least in the dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>Of the Soul</hi><note n='c'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> ii. 65 with note.</note> he disparages him
						by saying that he was not present at the death of
						Socrates, though he was no farther off than Aegina.
						Again, they say that he showed a certain jealousy of
						Aeschines, because of his reputation with Dionysius,
						and that, when he arrived at the court, he was
						despised by Plato because of his poverty, but supported by Aristippus. And Idomeneus asserts that
						the arguments used by Crito, when in the prison he
						urges Socrates to escape, are really due to Aeschines,
					<pb n='311'/>
					and that Plato transferred them to Crito because of
					his enmity to Aeschines.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
					<p>Nowhere in his writings does Plato mention himself
						by name, except in the dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi><note
							n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Phaedo</hi>, 59 b.</note> and
						the
						<hi rend='ital'>Apology.</hi><note n='b'>34 a.</note> Aristotle
						remarks that the style of
						the dialogues is half-way between poetry and prose.
						And according to Favorinus, when Plato read the
						dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi>, Aristotle alone stayed to
						the
						end; the rest of the audience got up and went
						away. Some say that Philippus of Opus copied out
						the
						<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi>, which were left upon waxen tablets, and
						it is said that he was the author of the
						<hi rend='ital'>Epinomis.</hi>
						Euphorion and Panaetius relate that the beginning of
						the
						<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> was found several times revised and
						rewritten, and the
						<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> itself Aristoxenus
						declares
						to have been nearly all of it included in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Controversies</hi> of Protagoras. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
						There is a story that the
						<hi rend='ital'>Phaedrus</hi> was his first dialogue. For the subject
						has about it something of the freshness of youth.
						Dicaearchus, however, censures its whole style as
						vulgar.</p>
					<p>A story is told that Plato once saw some one playing
						at dice and rebuked him. And, upon his protesting
						that he played for a trifle only, "But the habit,"
						rejoined Plato, "is not a trifle." Being asked
						whether there would be any memoirs of him as of
						his predecessors, he replied, "A man must first
						make a name, and he will have no lack of memoirs."
						One day, when Xenocrates had come in, Plato asked
						him to chastise his slave, since he was unable to do
						it himself because he was in a passion. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
						Further, it
						is alleged that he said to one of his slaves, "I would
						have given you a flogging, had I not been in a
						passion." Being mounted on horseback, he quickly
					<pb n='313'/>
					got down again, declaring that he was afraid he
						would be infected with horse-pride. He advised
						those who got drunk to view themselves in a mirror;
						for they would then abandon the habit which so
						disfigured them. To drink to excess was nowhere
						becoming, he used to say, save at the feasts of the
						god who was the giver of wine. He also disapproved
						of over - sleeping. At any rate in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi><note
							n='a'>808 b.</note> he
						declares that 
						<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
						"no one when asleep is good for anything." He also said that the truth is the pleasantest
						of sounds. Another version of this saying is that the
						pleasantest of all things is to speak the truth. Again,
						of truth he speaks thus in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi><note n='b'>663
							e.</note>: "Truth, O
						stranger, is a fair and durable thing. But it is a
						thing of which it is hard to persuade men." His wish
						always was to leave a memorial of himself behind,
						either in the hearts of his friends or in his books.
						He was himself fond of seclusion according to some
						authorities.</p>
					<p>His death, the circumstances of which have already
						been related, took place in the thirteenth year of
						the reign of King Philip, as stated by Favorinus in
						the third book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, and according
						to
						Theopompus<note n='c'>The awkwardness of this last clause can be

					<p>Now, as you are an enthusiastic Platonist, and
						rightly so, and as you eagerly seek out that philosopher's doctrines in preference to all others, I have
						thought it necessary to give some account of the
						true nature of his discourses, the arrangement of the
						dialogues, and the method of his inductive procedure, as far as possible in an elementary manner
						and in main outline, in order that the facts I have
						collected respecting his life may not suffer by the
						omission of his doctrines. For, in the words of the
						proverb, it would be taking owls to Athens, were
						I to give you of all people the full particulars.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
					<p>They say that Zeno the Eleatic was the first to
						write dialogues. But, according to Favorinus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, Aristotle in the first book of his
						dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>On Poets</hi> asserts that it was Alexamenus of Styra
						or
						Teos. In my opinion Plato, who brought this form
						of writing to perfection, ought to be adjudged the
						prize for its invention as well as for its embellishment.
						A dialogue is a discourse consisting of question and
						answer on some philosophical or political subject,
						with due regard to the characters of the persons
						introduced and the choice of diction. Dialectic is
						the art of discourse by which we either refute or
						establish some proposition by means of question and
						answer on the part of the interlocutors.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
					<p>Of the Platonic dialogues there are two most
						general types, the one adapted for instruction and
						the other for inquiry. And the former is further
						divided into two types, the theoretical and the
						practical. And of these the theoretical is divided
						into the physical and logical, and the practical into
						the ethical and political. The dialogue of inquiry
						also has two main divisions, the one of which aims at
						training the mind and the other at victory in controversy. Again, the part which aims at training
						the mind has two subdivisions, the one akin to the
						midwife's art, the other merely tentative. And that
						suited to controversy is also subdivided into one part
						which raises critical objections, and another which

					<p>I am not unaware that there are other ways in
						which certain writers classify the dialogues. For
						some dialogues they call dramatic, others narrative,
						and others again a mixture of the two. But the
						terms they employ in their classification of the
						dialogues are better suited to the stage than to
						philosophy. Physics is represented by the
						<hi rend='ital'>Timaeus</hi>,
						logic by the
						<hi rend='ital'>Statesman, Cratylus, Parmenides</hi> and
						<hi rend='ital'>Sophist</hi>, ethics by the
						<hi rend='ital'>Apology,
							Crito, Phaedo, Phaedrus</hi>
						and
						<hi rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>, as well as by the
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Menexenus, Clitophon</hi>,
						the
						<hi rend='ital'>Epistles, Philebus, Hipparchus</hi> and the
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Rivals</hi>, and
						lastly politics by the
						<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, 
						<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
						the
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Laws, Minos,
							Epinomis</hi>, and the dialogue concerning Atlantis.<note n='a'><hi
								rend='ital'>i.e. Critias.</hi></note>
						To the class of mental obstetrics belong the two
						<hi rend='ital'>Alcibiades, Theages, Lysis</hi> and
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Laches</hi>, while the
						<hi rend='ital'>Euthyphro, Meno, Io, Charmides</hi> and
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Theaetetus</hi> illustrate the tentative method. In the
						<hi rend='ital'>Protagoras</hi> is
						seen the method of critical objections; in the
					<pb n='323'/>
					<hi rend='ital'>Euthydemus, Gorgias</hi>, and the two dialogues
						entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Hippias</hi> that of subversive argument. So much then
						for dialogue, its definition and varieties.</p>
					<p>Again, as there is great division of opinion between
						those who affirm and those who deny that Plato was
						a dogmatist, let me proceed to deal with this further
						question. To be a dogmatist in philosophy is to lay
						down positive dogmas, just as to be a legislator is
						to lay down laws. Further, under dogma two things
						are included, the thing opined and the opinion itself.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
					<p>Of these the former is a proposition, the latter a
						conception. Now where he has a firm grasp Plato
						expounds his own view and refutes the false one,
						but, if the subject is obscure, he suspends judgement.
						His own views are expounded by four persons,
						Socrates, Timaeus, the Athenian Stranger,<note n='a'>In the
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Laws.</hi></note> the
						Eleatic Stranger.<note n='b'>In the
							<hi rend='ital'>Sophist</hi> and
							the
							<hi rend='ital'>Statesman.</hi></note> These strangers are not, as
						some
						hold, Plato and Parmenides, but imaginary characters
						without names,<note n='c'>That the Eleatic Stranger is not Parmenides
							is decisively
							proved by
							<hi rend='ital'>Soph.</hi> 241 e.</note> for, even when
						Socrates and Timaeus
						are the speakers, it is Plato's doctrines that are laid
						down. To illustrate the refutation of false opinions,
						he introduces Thrasymachus, Callicles, Polus, Gorgias,
						Protagoras, or again Hippias, Euthydemus and the
						like.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>	
					<p>In constructing his proofs he makes most use of
						induction, not always in the same way, but under
						two forms. For induction is an argument which by
						means of certain true premisses properly infers a
						truth resembling them. And there are two kinds of
						induction, the one proceeding by way of contradiction, the other from agreement. In the kind which
						proceeds by contradiction the answer given to every
						question will necessarily be the contrary of the
					<pb n='325'/>
					respondent's position,
						<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "My father is
						either other
						than or the same as your father. If then your
						father is other than my father, by being other than
						a father he will not be a father. But if he is the
						same as my father, then by being the same as my
						father he will be my father." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
						And again: "If
						man is not an animal, he will be either a stick or a
						stone. But he is not a stick or a stone; for he is
						animate and self-moved. Therefore he is an animal.
						But if he is an animal, and if a dog or an ox is also
						an animal, then man by being an animal will be a
						dog and an ox as well." This is the kind of induction
						which proceeds by contradiction and dispute, and
						Plato used it, not for laying down positive doctrines
						but for refutation. The other kind of induction by
						agreement appears in two forms, the one proving
						the particular conclusion under discussion from a
						particular, the other proceeding by way of the universal [by means of particular facts]. The former is
						suited to rhetoric, the latter to dialectic. For instance, under the first form the question is raised,
						"Did so-and-so commit a murder?" The proof is
						that he was found at the time with stains of blood
						on him. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
						This is the rhetorical form of induction,
						since rhetoric also is concerned with particular facts
						and not with universals. It does not inquire about
						justice in the abstract, but about particular cases of
						justice. The other kind, where the general proposition is first established by means of particular
						facts, is the induction of dialectic. For instance, the
						question put is whether the soul is immortal, and
						whether the living come back from the dead. And
						this is proved in the dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi> by
						means
						of a certain general proposition, that opposites pro-
					<pb n='327'/>
					ceed from opposites. And the general proposition
						itself is established by means of certain propositions
						which are particular, as that sleep comes from
						waking and
						<hi rend='ital'>vice versa</hi>, the greater from the less
						and
						<hi rend='ital'>vice versa.</hi> This is the form which he used to
						establish
						his own views.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
					<p>But, just as long ago in tragedy the chorus was
						the only actor, and afterwards, in order to give the
						chorus breathing space, Thespis devised a single
						actor, Aeschylus a second, Sophocles a third, and
						thus tragedy was completed, so too with philosophy: in early times it discoursed on one subject
						only, namely physics, then Socrates added the second
						subject, ethics, and Plato the third, dialectics, and
						so brought philosophy to perfection. Thrasylus says
						that he published his dialogues in tetralogies, like
						those of the tragic poets. Thus they contended with
						four plays at the Dionysia, the Lenaea, the Panathenaea and the festival of Chytri.<note n='a'>Pots.</note> Of the
						four
						plays the last was a satiric drama; and the four
						together were called a tetralogy.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
					<p>Now, says Thrasylus, the genuine dialogues are
						fifty-six in all, if the
						<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> be divided into
						ten and
						the
						<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi> into twelve. Favorinus, however, in the
						second book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> declares

						a work of Protagoras entitled
						<hi rend='ital'>Controversies.</hi><note

						gives nine tetralogies, if the
						<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> takes the

						of one single work and the
						<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi> of another. His
						first tetralogy has a common plan underlying it, for
						he wishes to describe what the life of the philosopher
					<pb n='329'/>
					will be. To each of the works Thrasylus affixes a
						double title, the one taken from the name of the

					<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
					<p>Plato has employed a variety of terms in order
						to make his system less intelligible to the ignorant.
						But in a special sense he considers wisdom to be the
						science of those things which are objects of thought
						and really existent, the science which, he says, is
						concerned with God and the soul as separate from
						the body. And especially by wisdom he means
						philosophy, which is a yearning for divine wisdom.
						And in a general sense all experience is also termed
						by him wisdom,
						<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> when he calls a craftsman
						wise.
						And he applies the same terms with very different
						meanings. For instance, the word
						<foreign lang='greek'>fau=los</foreign>
						(slight,
						plain) is employed by him<note n='b'>As
							<hi rend='ital'>e.g.

						(simple, honest), just as it is applied to Heracles in

						passage<note n='c'>Nauck,
							<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi

					<p>Plain (<foreign lang='greek'>fau=los</foreign>), unaccomplished,
						staunch to do great deeds,
						unversed in talk, with all his store of wisdom curtailed to
						action.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
					<p>But sometimes Plato uses this same word (<foreign lang='greek'>fau=los</foreign>)
						to mean what is bad, and at other times for what is
						small or petty. Again, he often uses different terms
						to express the same thing. For instance, he calls the
						Idea form (<foreign lang='greek'>ei)=dos</foreign>), genus (<foreign lang='greek'>ge/nos</foreign>), archetype (<foreign lang='greek'>para/-deigma</foreign>), principle 
						(<foreign lang='greek'>a)rxh/</foreign>) and
						cause (<foreign lang='greek'>ai)/tion</foreign>). He also
						uses contrary expressions for the same thing. Thus
						he calls the sensible thing both existent and non-
					<pb n='335'/>
					existent, existent inasmuch as it comes into being,
						non-existent because it is continually changing. And
						he says the Idea is neither in motion nor at rest;
						that it is uniformly the same and yet both one and
						many. And it is his habit to do this in many more
						instances.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
					<p>The right interpretation of his dialogues includes
						three things: first, the meaning of every statement
						must be explained; next, its purpose, whether it is
						made for a primary reason or by way of illustration,
						and whether to establish his own doctrines or to
						refute his interlocutor; in the third place it remains
						to examine its truth.</p>
					<p>And since certain critical marks are affixed to his
						works let us now say a word about these. The cross
						X is taken to indicate peculiar expressions and
						figures of speech, and generally any idiom of Platonic
						usage; the
						<hi rend='ital'>diple</hi><note n='a'>A wedge-shaped mark >,

						much for the critical marks and his writings in

					<p>And from the centre outwards it encloses the body
						on all sides in a circle, and is compounded of elements,
						and, being divided at harmonic intervals, it forms
						two circles which touch one another twice; and the
						interior circle, being slit six times over, makes seven
						circles in all. And this interior circle moves by way
						of the diagonal to the left, and the other by way of
						the side to the right. Hence also the one is supreme,
						being a single circle, for the other interior circle was
						divided; the former is the circle of the Same, the
						latter that of the Other, whereby he means that the
						motion of the soul is the motion of the universe

					<p>And the division from the centre to the circumference which is adjusted in harmony with the soul
						being thus determined, the soul knows that which
						is, and adjusts it proportionately because she has the
						elements proportionately disposed in herself. And
						when the circle of the Other revolves aright, the
						result is opinion; but from the regular motion of
						the circle of the Same comes knowledge. He set
						forth two universal principles, God and matter, and
						he calls God mind and cause; he held that matter
						is devoid of form and unlimited, and that composite
						things arise out of it<note n='e'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,

						This substance, he says, is
						converted into
						the four elements, fire, water, air, earth, of which
						the world itself and all that therein is are formed.
						Earth alone of these elements is not subject to
						change, the assumed cause being the peculiarity of
						its constituent triangles. For he thinks that in all
						the other elements the figures employed are homogeneous, the scalene triangle out of which they are
						all put together being one and the same, whereas
						for earth a triangle of peculiar shape is employed;
						the element of fire is a pyramid, of air an octahedron,

						intelligible causes<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 29 e-30 a; 42 e.</note>; so that, as God is of
						this nature,
						and the universe resembles the best in its perfect
						beauty, it will not be in the likeness of anything
						created, but only of God.</p>

					<p>The universe is composed of fire, water, air and
						earth; of fire in order to be visible; of earth in
						order to be solid; of water and air in order to be
						proportional.<note n='e'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Tim.</hi> 31 b-33 a. It
							would be more correct to say
							"in order that the bonds, the inserted terms (air and water),
							which unite fire to earth, may be proportional." "For the
							best of bonds is that which makes itself and the things which
							it binds as complete a unity as possible; and the nature of
							proportion is to accomplish this most perfectly" (<hi
								rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 31 c).</note> For the powers represented by solids
						are connected by two mean proportionals in a way
						to secure the complete unity of the whole. And the
						universe was made of all the elements in order to be
						complete and indestructible.</p>
					<p>Time was created as an image of eternity. And
						while the latter remains for ever at rest, time consists in the motion of the universe. For night and
						day and month and the like are all parts of time;
						for which reason, apart from the nature of the
						universe, time has no existence. But so soon as the
						universe is fashioned time exists.<note n='f'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>

					<p>And the sun and moon and planets were created
					<pb n='343'/>
					as means to the creation of time. And God kindled
						the light of the sun in order that the number of the
						seasons might be definite and in order that animals
						might possess number. The moon is in the circle
						immediately above the earth, and the sun in that
						which is next beyond that, and in the circles above
						come the planets. Further, the universe is an
						animate being, for it is bound fast in animate movement.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 38 c-39 d.</note> And in order that the universe
						which had
						been created in the likeness of the intelligible living
						creature might be rendered complete, the nature
						of all other animals was created. Since then its
						pattern possesses them, the universe also ought to
						have them. And thus it contains gods for the most
						part of a fiery nature; of the rest there are three
						kinds, winged, aquatic and terrestrial.<note n='b'><hi

							<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 30 c-31 b; 39 c-40

						And of all

						that some things are due to reason and others have
						a necessary cause,<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
							<hi

					<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
					<p>The principles, then, and causes assumed are the
						two above mentioned, of which God and matter are
						the exemplar. Matter is of necessity formless like
						the other recipients of form. Of all these there is
						a necessary cause. For it somehow or other receives
						the ideas and so generates substances, and it moves
						because its power is not uniform, and, being in
					<pb n='345'/>
					motion, it in turn sets in motion those things which
						are generated from it. And these were at first in
						irrational and irregular motion, but after they began
						to frame the universe, under the conditions possible
						they were made by God symmetrical and regular.
						<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
						For the two causes existed even before the world
						was made, as well as becoming in the third place, but
						they were not distinct, merely traces of them being
						found, and in disorder. When the world was made,
						they too acquired order.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 52 d; 53 b; 57 c; 69 b, c.</note> And out of all
						the bodies
						there are the universe was fashioned. He holds God,
						like the soul, to be incorporeal. For only thus is he
						exempt from change and decay. As already stated,
						he assumes the Ideas to be causes and principles
						whereby the world of natural objects is what it is.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
					<p>On good and evil he would discourse to this effect.
						He maintained that the end to aim at is assimilation
						to God, that virtue is in itself sufficient for happiness,
						but that it needs in addition, as instruments for use,
						first, bodily advantages like health and strength,
						sound senses and the like, and, secondly, external
						advantages such as wealth, good birth and reputation. But the wise man will be no less happy even
						if he be without these things. Again, he will take
						part in public affairs, will marry, and will refrain
						from breaking the laws which have been made. And
						as far as circumstances allow he will legislate for
						his own country, unless in the extreme corruption of
						the people he sees that the state of affairs completely
						justifies his abstention. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
						He thinks that the gods
						take note of human life<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 30 b; 44 c.</note> and that there are superhuman beings.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
									<hi
										rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 40 d.</note> He was the first to define the
						notion of good as that which is bound up with
					<pb n='347'/>
					whatever is praiseworthy and rational and useful
						and proper and becoming. And all these are bound
						up with that which is consistent and in accord with
						nature.</p>
					<p>He also discoursed on the propriety of names, and
						indeed he was the first to frame a science for rightly
						asking and answering questions, having employed it
						himself to excess. And in the dialogues he conceived
						righteousness to be the law of God because it is
						stronger to incite men to do righteous acts, that
						malefactors may not be punished after death also.
						<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
						Hence to some he appeared too fond of myths.
						These narratives he intermingles with his works in
						order to deter men from wickedness, by reminding
						them how little they know of what awaits them<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
							<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 42 b.</note> after
						death. Such, then, are the doctrines he approved.</p>
					<p>He used also to divide things, according to Aristotle, in the following manner.<note n='b'> The third appendix begins
						here, containing the
						<foreign lang='greek'>diaire/seis</foreign>
						which are also attributed to Aristotle; see Rose,
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Aristoteles
							Pseudepigraphus,</hi> pp. 679
						<hi rend='ital'>sqq.,</hi> who gives a
						Christian recension. The original, the common source of Diogenes Laertius
						and the Christian writer, he refers vaguely to the Hellenistio
						age.</note> Goods are in the
						mind or in the body, or external. For example,
						justice, prudence, courage, temperance and such like
						are in the mind; beauty, a good constitution, health
						and strength in the body; while friends, the welfare
						of one's country and riches are amongst external
						things.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
					<p>Thus there are three kinds of goods: goods of the
						mind, goods of the body and external goods. There
						are three species of friendship: one species is natural,
						another social, and another hospitable. By natural
						friendship we mean the affection which parents have
						for their offspring and kinsmen for each other. And
						other animals besides man have inherited this form.</p>
					<pb n='349'/>
					<p>By the social form of friendship we mean that which
						arises from intimacy and has nothing to do with
						kinship; for instance, that of Pylades for Orestes.
						The friendship of hospitality is that which is extended
						to strangers owing to an introduction or letters of
						recommendation. Thus friendship is either natural
						or social or hospitable. Some add a fourth species,
						that of love.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
					<p>There are five forms of civil government: one form
						is democratic, another aristocratic, a third oligarchic,
						a fourth monarchic, a fifth that of a tyrant. The
						democratic form is that in which the people has control and chooses at its own pleasure both magistrates
						and laws. The aristocratic form is that in which the
						rulers are neither the rich nor the poor nor the
						nobles, but the state is under the guidance of the
						best. Oligarchy is that form in which there is a
						property-qualification for the holding of office; for
						the rich are fewer than the poor. Monarchy is
						either regulated by law or hereditary. At Carthage
						the kingship is regulated by law, the office being
						put up for sale.<note n='a'>Plato probably refers to Carthage when he
							mentions
							<hi rend='ital'>purchasable</hi> kingship,
							<foreign lang='greek'>w)nhtai\
								basilei=ai</foreign>, amongst barbarians,
							<hi rend='ital'>Rep.</hi> 544 d. Aristotle repeats the epithet in his
							description
							of the Carthaginian constitution,
							<hi rend='ital'>Pol.</hi> ii. 11,
							1273 a 36.
							Polybius says that at Carthage magistrates attain office,
							<foreign lang='greek'>dw=ra
								fanerw=s dido/ntes</foreign>, vi. 56. 4. This phrase is some help
							towards an explanation, but whether it means open bribery
							--possibly of the people, more probably of the Council--
							or whether it refers to very large fees payable upon taking
							office, it is not easy to determine. In either case wealth
							would preponderate over merit.</note> 
						<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
						But the monarchy in Lacedaemon
						and in Macedonia is hereditary, for they select the
						king from a certain family. A tyranny is that form
						in which the citizens are ruled either through fraud
						or force by an individual. Thus civil government
						is either democratic, aristocratic, oligarchic, or a
						monarchy or a tyranny.</p>
					<p>There are three species of justice. One is con-
					<pb n='351'/>
					cerned with gods, another with men, and the third
						with the departed. For those who sacrifice according to the laws and take care of the temples are
						obviously pious towards the gods. Those again who
						repay loans and restore what they have received
						upon trust act justly towards men. Lastly, those
						who take care of tombs are obviously just towards
						the departed. Thus one species of justice relates to
						the gods, another to men, while a third species is
						concerned with the departed.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
					<p>There are three species of knowledge or science,
						one practical, another productive, and a third theoretical. For architecture and shipbuilding are productive arts, since the work produced by them can
						be seen. Politics and flute-playing, harp-playing
						and similar arts are practical. For nothing visible
						is produced by them; yet they do or perform something. In the one case the artist plays the flute or
						the harp, in the other the politician takes part in
						politics. Geometry and harmonics and astronomy
						are theoretical sciences. For they neither perform
						nor produce anything. But the geometer considers
						how lines are related to each other, the student of
						harmony investigates sounds, the astronomer stars
						and the universe. Thus some sciences are theoretical,
						others are practical, and others are productive.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
					<p>There are five species of medicine : the first is
						pharmacy, the second is surgery, the third deals
						with diet and regimen, the fourth with diagnosis,
						the fifth with remedies. Pharmacy cures sickness
						by drugs, surgery heals by the use of knife and
						cautery, the species concerned with diet prescribes
						a regimen for the removal of disease, that concerned
						with diagnosis proceeds by determining the nature
					<pb n='353'/>
					of the ailment, that concerned with remedies by
						prescribing for the immediate removal of the pain.
						The species of medicine, then, are pharmacy, surgery, diet and regimen, diagnosis, prescription of
						remedies.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
					<p>There are two divisions of law, the one written
						and the other unwritten. Written law is that under
						which we live in different cities, but that which has
						arisen out of custom is called unwritten law; for
						instance, not to appear in the market-place undressed
						or in women's attire. There is no statute forbidding
						this, but nevertheless we abstain from such conduct
						because it is prohibited by an unwritten law. Thus
						law is either written or unwritten.</p>
					<p>There are five kinds of speech, of which one is
						that which politicians employ in the assemblies;
						this is called political speech. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
						The second division
						is that which the rhetors employ in written compositions, whether composed for display or praise or
						blame, or for accusation. Hence this division is
						termed rhetorical. The third division of speech is
						that of private persons conversing with one another;
						this is called the mode of speech of ordinary life.
						Another division of speech is the language of those
						who converse by means of short questions and
						answers; this kind is called dialectical. The fifth
						division is the speech of craftsmen conversing about
						their own subjects; this is called technical language.
						Thus speech is either political, or rhetorical, or that
						of ordinary conversation, or dialectical, or technical.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
					<p>Music has three divisions. One employs the mouth
						alone, like singing. The second employs both the
					<pb n='355'/>
					mouth and the hands, as is the case with the harper
						singing to his own accompaniment. The third
						division employs the hands alone; for instance, the
						music of the harp. Thus music employs either the
						mouth alone, or the mouth and the hands, or the
						hands alone.</p>
					<p>Nobility has four divisions. First, when the ancestors are gentle and handsome and also just, their
						descendants are said to be noble. Secondly, when
						the ancestors have been princes or magistrates, their
						descendants are said to be noble. The third kind
						arises when the ancestors have been illustrious; for
						instance, through having held military command or
						through success in the national games. For then
						we call the descendants noble. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
						The last division
						includes the man who is himself of a generous and
						high-minded spirit. He too is said to be noble.
						And this indeed is the highest form of nobility.
						Thus, of nobility, one kind depends on excellent
						ancestors, another on princely ancestors, a third on
						illustrious ancestors, while the fourth is due to the
						individual's own beauty and worth.</p>
					<p>Beauty has three divisions. The first is the object
						of praise, as of form fair to see. Another is serviceable; thus an instrument, a house and the like are
						beautiful for use. Other things again which relate
						to customs and pursuits and the like are beautiful
						because beneficial. Of beauty, then, one kind is
						matter for praise, another is for use, and another
						for the benefit it procures.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
					<p>The soul has three divisions. One part of it is
						rational, another appetitive, and a third irascible.
						Of these the rational part is the cause of purpose,
						reflection, understanding and the like. The appeti-
					<pb n='357'/>
					tive part of the soul is the cause of desire of eating,
						sexual indulgence and the like, while the irascible
						part is the cause of courage, of pleasure and pain,
						and of anger. Thus one part of the soul is rational,
						another appetitive, and a third irascible.</p>
					<p>Of perfect virtue there are four species: prudence,
						justice, bravery and temperance. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
						Of these prudence
						is the cause of right conduct, justice of just dealing
						in partnerships and commercial transactions. Bravery
						is the cause which makes a man not give way but
						stand his ground in alarms and perils. Temperance
						causes mastery over desires, so that we are never
						enslaved by any pleasure, but lead an orderly life.
						Thus virtue includes first prudence, next justice,
						thirdly bravery, and lastly temperance.</p>
					<p>Rule has five divisions, one that which is according
						to law, another according to nature, another according to custom, a fourth by birth, a fifth by force.
						<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
						Now the magistrates in cities when elected by their
						fellow-citizens rule according to law. The natural
						rulers are the males, not only among men, but
						also among the other animals; for the males everywhere exert wide-reaching rule over the females.
						Rule according to custom is such authority as
						attendants exercise over children and teachers over
						their pupils. Hereditary rule is exemplified by that
						of the Lacedaemonian kings, for the office of king is
						confined to a certain family. And the same system
						is in force for the kingdom of Macedonia; for there
						too the office of king goes by birth. Others have
					<pb n='359'/>
					acquired power by force or fraud, and govern the
						citizens against their will; this kind of rule is called
						forcible. Thus rule is either by law, or by nature,
						or by custom, or by birth, or by force.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
					<p>There are six kinds of rhetoric. For when the
						speakers urge war or alliance with a neighbouring
						state, that species of rhetoric is called persuasion.
						But when they speak against making war or alliance,
						and urge their hearers to remain at peace, this kind
						of rhetoric is called dissuasion. A third kind is
						employed when a speaker asserts that he is wronged
						by some one whom he makes out to have caused
						him much mischief; accusation is the name applied
						to the kind here defined. The fourth kind of rhetoric
						is termed defence; here the speaker shows that he
						has done no wrong and that his conduct is in no
						respect abnormal; defence is the term applied in
						such a case. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
						A fifth kind of rhetoric is employed
						when a speaker speaks well of some one and proves
						him to be worthy and honourable; encomium is the
						name given to this kind. A sixth kind is that
						employed when the speaker shows some one to be unworthy; the name given to this is invective. Under
						rhetoric, then, are included encomium, invective,
						persuasion, dissuasion, accusation and defence.</p>
					<p>Successful speaking has four divisions. The first
						consists in speaking to the purpose, the next to the
						requisite length, the third before the proper audience,
						and the fourth at the proper moment. The things
						to the purpose are those which are likely to be
						expedient for speaker and hearer. The requisite
						length is that which is neither more nor less than
						enough. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
						To speak to the proper audience means
						this: in addressing persons older than yourself, the
					<pb n='361'/>
					discourse must be made suitable to the audience as
						being elderly men; whereas in addressing juniors
						the discourse must be suitable to young men.
						The proper time of speaking is neither too soon nor
						too late; otherwise you will miss the mark and not
						speak with success.</p>
					<p>Of conferring benefits there are four divisions.
						For it takes place either by pecuniary aid or by
						personal service, by means of knowledge or of speech.
						Pecuniary aid is given when one assists a man in
						need, so that he is relieved from all anxiety on the
						score of money. Personal service is given when men
						come up to those who are being beaten and rescue
						them. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
						Those who train or heal, or who teach something valuable, confer benefit by means of knowledge.
						But when men enter a law-court and one appears as
						advocate for another and delivers an effective speech
						on his behalf, he is benefiting him by speech. Thus
						benefits are conferred by means either of money or
						of personal service, or of knowledge, or of speech.</p>
					<p>There are four ways in which things are completed
						and brought to an end. The first is by legal enactment, when a decree is passed and this decree is
						confirmed by law. The second is in the course of
						nature, as the day, the year and the seasons are
						completed. The third is by the rules of art, say the
						builder's art, for so a house is completed; and so it
						is with shipbuilding, whereby vessels are completed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
						Fourthly, matters are brought to an end by chance
						or accident, when they turn out otherwise than is
						expected. Thus the completion of things is due
						either to law, or to nature, or to art, or to chance.</p>
					<p>Of power or ability there are four divisions. First,
						whatever we can do with the mind, namely calculate
					<pb n='363'/>
					or anticipate; next, whatever we can effect with the
						body, for instance, marching, giving, taking and the
						like. Thirdly, whatever we can do by a multitude
						of soldiers or a plentiful supply of money; hence a
						king is said to have great power. The fourth division
						of power or influence is doing, or being done by, well
						or ill; thus we can become ill or be educated, be
						restored to health and the like. Power, then, is
						either in the mind, or the body, or in armies and
						resources, or in acting and being acted upon.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
					<p>Philanthropy is of three kinds. One is by way of
						salutations, as when certain people address every one
						they meet and, stretching out their hand, give him
						a hearty greeting; another mode is seen when one
						is given to assisting every one in distress; another
						mode of philanthropy is that which makes certain
						people fond of giving dinners. Thus philanthropy is
						shown either by a courteous address, or by conferring
						benefits, or by hospitality and the promotion of social
						intercourse.</p>
					<p>Welfare or happiness includes five parts. One
						part of it is good counsel, a second soundness of the
						senses and bodily health, a third success in one's
						undertakings, a fourth a reputation with one's
						fellow-men, a fifth ample means in money and in
						whatever else subserves the end of life. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
						Now deliberating well is a result of education and of having
						experience of many things. Soundness of the senses
						depends upon the bodily organs: I mean, if one sees
						with his eyes, hears with his ears, and perceives
						with his nostrils and his mouth the appropriate
						objects, then such a condition is soundness of the
						senses. Success is attained when a man does what
						he aims at in the right way, as becomes a good man.</p>
					<pb n='365'/>
					<p>A man has a good reputation when he is well spoken
						of. A man has ample means when he is so equipped
						for the needs of life that he can afford to benefit his
						friends and discharge his public services with lavish
						display. If a man has all these things, he is completely happy. Thus of welfare or happiness one
						part is good counsel, another soundness of senses
						and bodily health, a third success, a fourth a good
						reputation, a fifth ample means.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
					<p>There are three divisions of the arts and crafts.
						The first division consists of mining and forestry,
						which are productive arts. The second includes
						the smith's and carpenter's arts which transform
						material; for the smith makes weapons out of iron,
						and the carpenter transforms timber into flutes and
						lyres. The third division is that which uses what is
						thus made, as horsemanship employs bridles, the art
						of war employs weapons, and music flutes and the
						lyre. Thus of art there are three several species,
						those above-mentioned in the first, second and third
						place.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
					<p>Good is divided into four kinds. One is the possessor of virtue, whom we affirm to be individually
						good. Another is virtue itself and justice; these
						we affirm to be good. A third includes such things
						as food, suitable exercises and drugs. The fourth
						kind which we affirm to be good includes the arts of
						flute-playing, acting and the like. Thus there are
						four kinds of good: the possession of virtue; virtue
						itself; thirdly, food and beneficial exercises; lastly,
						flute-playing, acting, and the poetic art. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
						Whatever
						is is either evil or good or indifferent. We call that
						evil which is capable of invariably doing harm; for
					<pb n='367'/>
					instance, bad judgement and folly and injustice and
						the like. The contraries of these things are good.
						But the things which can sometimes benefit and
						sometimes harm, such as walking and sitting and
						eating, or which can neither do any benefit nor
						harm at all, these are things indifferent, neither
						good nor evil. Thus all things whatever are either
						good, or evil, or neither good nor evil.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
					<p>Good order in the state falls under three heads.
						First, if the laws are good, we say that there is good
						government. Secondly, if the citizens obey the
						established laws, we also call this good government.
						Thirdly, if, without the aid of laws, the people
						manage their affairs well under the guidance of
						customs and institutions, we call this again good
						government. Thus three forms of good government may exist, (1) when the laws are good, (2) when
						the existing laws are obeyed, (3) when the people
						live under salutary customs and institutions.</p>
					<p>Disorder in a state has three forms. The first
						arises when the laws affecting citizens and strangers
						are alike bad, 
						<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
						the second when the existing laws are
						not obeyed, and the third when there is no law at
						all. Thus the state is badly governed when the laws
						are bad or not obeyed, or lastly, when there is no law.</p>
					<p>Contraries are divided into three species. For
						instance, we say that goods are contrary to evils, as
						justice to injustice, wisdom to folly, and the like.
						Again, evils are contrary to evils, prodigality is
						contrary to niggardliness, and to be unjustly tortured
						is the contrary of being justly tortured, and so with
						similar evils. Again, heavy is the contrary of light,
					<pb n='369'/>
					quick of slow, black of white, and these pairs are
						contraries, while they are neither good nor evil. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
						Thus,
						of contraries, some are opposed as goods to evils,
						others as evils to evils, and others, as things which are
						neither good nor evil, are opposed to one another.</p>
					<p>There are three kinds of goods, those which can
						be exclusively possessed, those which can be shared
						with others, and those which simply exist. To the
						first division, namely, those which can be exclusively
						possessed, belong such things as justice and health.
						To the next belong all those which, though they
						cannot be exclusively possessed, can be shared with
						others. Thus we cannot possess the absolute good,
						but we can participate in it. The third division
						includes those goods the existence of which is
						necessary, though we can neither possess them exclusively nor participate in them. The mere existence of worth and justice is a good; and these things
						cannot be shared or had in exclusive possession, but
						must simply exist. Of goods, then, some are possessed exclusively, some shared, and others merely
						subsist.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
					<p>Counsel is divided under three heads. One is
						taken from past time, one from the future, and the
						third from the present. That from past time consists of examples; for instance, what the Lacedaemonians suffered through trusting others. Counsel
						drawn from the present is to show, for instance, that
						the walls are weak, the men cowards, and the
						supplies running short. Counsel from the future is.
						for instance, to urge that we should not wrong the
						embassies by suspicions, lest the fair fame of Hellas
						be stained. Thus counsel is derived from the past,
						the present and the future.</p>

					<p>Vocal sound falls into two divisions according as it
						is animate or inanimate. The voice of living things
						is animate sound; notes of instruments and noises
						are inanimate. And of the animate voice part is
						articulate, part inarticulate, that of men being
						articulate speech, that of the animals inarticulate.
						Thus vocal sound is either animate or inanimate.</p>
					<p>Whatever exists is either divisible or indivisible.
						Of divisible things some are divisible into similar
						and others into dissimilar parts. Those things are
						indivisible which cannot be divided and are not
						compounded of elements, for example, the unit,
						the point and the musical note; whereas those which
						have constituent parts, for instance, syllables, concords in music, animals, water, gold, are divisible.
						<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
						If they are composed of similar parts, so that the
						whole does not differ from the part except in bulk,
						as water, gold and all that is fusible, and the like,
						then they are termed homogeneous. But whatever
						is composed of dissimilar parts, as a house and the
						like, is termed heterogeneous. Thus all things whatever are either divisible or indivisible, and of those
						which are divisible some are homogeneous, others
						heterogeneous in their parts.</p>
					<p>Of existing things some are absolute and some are
						called relative. Things said to exist absolutely are
						those which need nothing else to explain them, as
						man, horse, and all other animals. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>
						For none of these
						gains by explanation. To those which are called
						relative belong all which stand in need of some
						explanation, as that which is greater than something
						or quicker than something, or more beautiful and
						the like. For the greater implies a less, and the
						quicker is quicker than something. Thus existing
					<pb n='373'/>
					things are either absolute or relative. And in this
						way, according to Aristotle, Plato used to divide the
						primary conceptions also.</p>
					<p>There was also another man named Plato, a
						philosopher of Rhodes, a pupil of Panaetius, as is
						stated by Seleucus the grammarian in his first book
						<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophy</hi>; another a Peripatetic and pupil of
						Aristotle; and another who was a pupil of Praxiphanes; and lastly, there was Plato, the poet of the
						Old Comedy.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					<p>The foregoing is the best account of Plato that we

						He set
						up statues of the Graces in the shrine of the Muses
						erected by Plato in the Academy. He adhered
						faithfully to Plato's doctrines. In character, however,
						he was unlike him, being prone to anger and easily
						overcome by pleasures. At any rate there is a story
						that in a fit of passion he flung his favourite dog
						into the well, and that pleasure was the sole motive

					<p>It was said that among those who attended his

					<head>Chapter 2. XENOCRATES (396-314 B.C.)
					(Head of the Academy 339-314 B.C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<p>Xenocrates, the son of Agathenor, was a native of
						Chalcedon. He was a pupil of Plato from his earliest
						youth; moreover he accompanied him on his journey
						to Sicily. He was naturally slow and clumsy. Hence
						Plato, comparing him to Aristotle, said, "The one
						needed a spur, the other a bridle." And again,
						"See what an ass I am training and what a horse
						he has to run against." However, Xenocrates was
						in all besides dignified and grave of demeanour,
						which made Plato say to him continually, "Xenocrates, sacrifice to the Graces." He spent most of
						his time in the Academy; and whenever he was going
						to betake himself to the city, it is said that all the
						noisy rabble and hired porters made way for him as
						he passed. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
						And that once the notorious Phryne
						tried to make his acquaintance and, as if she were
						being chased by some people, took refuge under his
						roof; that he admitted her out of ordinary humanity
						and, there being but one small couch in the room,
						permitted her to share it with him, and at last, after
					<pb n='383'/>
					many importunities, she retired without success,
						telling those who inquired that he whom she quitted
						was not a man but a statue. Another version of the
						story is that his pupils induced La&iuml;s to invade his
						couch; and that so great was his endurance that he
						many times submitted to amputation and cautery.
						His words were entirely worthy of credit, so much
						so that, although it was illegal for witnesses to give
						evidence unsworn, the Athenians allowed Xenocrates
						alone to do so. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
						Furthermore, he was extremely
						independent; at all events, when Alexander sent
						him a large sum of money, he took three thousand
						Attic drachmas and sent back the rest to Alexander,
						whose needs, he said, were greater than his own,
						because he had a greater number of people to keep.
						Again, he would not accept the present sent him by
						Antipater, as Myronianus attests in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Parallels.</hi>
						And when he had been honoured at the court of
						Dionysius with a golden crown as the prize for his
						prowess in drinking at the Feast of Pitchers, he went
						out and placed it on the statue of Hermes just as
						he had been accustomed to place there garlands of
						flowers. There is a story that, when he was sent,
						along with others also, on an embassy to Philip, his
						colleagues, being bribed, accepted Philip's invitations to feasts and talked with him. Xenocrates
						did neither the one nor the other. Indeed on this
						account Philip declined to see him. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
						Hence, when
						the envoys returned to Athens, they complained
						that Xenocrates had accompanied them without
						rendering any service. Thereupon the people were
						ready to fine him. But when he told them that
						now more than ever they ought to consider the
						interests of the state--"for," said he, "Philip knew
					<pb n='385'/>
					that the others had accepted his bribes, but that he
						would never win me over"--then the people paid
						him double honours. And afterwards Philip said that,
						of all who had arrived at his court, Xenocrates was
						the only man whom he could not bribe. Moreover,
						when he went as envoy to Antipater to plead for
						Athenians taken prisoners in the Lamian war,<note n='a'>322 b.c.</note>
						being
						invited to dine with Antipater, he quoted to him
						the following lines<note n='b'>Hom.
							<hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> x.
							383-5.</note>:</p>
					<p>O Circe! what righteous man would have the heart to
						taste meat and drink ere he had redeemed his company and
						beheld them face to face?</p>
					<p>and so pleased Antipater with his ready wit that he
					at once released them.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
					<p>When a little sparrow was pursued by a hawk and
						rushed into his bosom, he stroked it and let it go,
						declaring that a suppliant must not be betrayed.
						When bantered by Bion, he said he would make no
						reply. For neither, said he, does tragedy deign to
						answer the banter of comedy. To some one who had
						never learnt either music or geometry or astronomy,
						but nevertheless wished to attend his lectures,
						Xenocrates said, "Go your ways, for you offer
						philosophy nothing to lay hold of." Others report
						him as saying, "It is not to me that you come for
						the carding of a fleece."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
					<p>When Dionysius told Plato that he would lose his
						head, Xenocrates, who was present, pointed to his
						own and added, "No man shall touch it till he cut
						off mine." They say too that, when Antipater came
						to Athens and greeted him, he did not address him
						in return until he had finished what he was saying.
						He was singularly free from pride; more than once
					<pb n='387'/>
					a day he would retire into himself, and he assigned,
						it is said, a whole hour to silence.</p>

						Even in

						to a pillar, where he had buried it for the same
						purpose. And one day, by agreement with his
						young friends, he burst into the school of Xenocrates
						quite drunk, with a garland on his head. Xenocrates,
						however, without being at all disturbed, went on
						with his discourse as before, the subject being
						temperance. The lad, as he listened, by degrees
						was taken in the toils. He became so industrious
					<pb n='395'/>
					as to surpass all the other scholars, and rose to be
						himself head of the school in the 116th Olympiad.<note n='a'>316-312
						b.c.</note></p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<p>Antigonus of Carystus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Biographies</hi> says
						that
						his father was foremost among the citizens and kept
						horses to compete in the chariot-race; that Polemo
						himself had been defendant in an action brought by
						his wife, who charged him with cruelty owing to the
						irregularities of his life; but that, from the time
						when he began to study philosophy, he acquired
						such strength of character as always to maintain the
						same unruffled calm of demeanour. Nay more, he
						never lost control of his voice. This in fact accounts
						for the fascination which he exercised over Crantor.
						<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra,</hi> &sect;24.</note>
						Certain it is that, when a mad dog bit him in the
						back of his thigh, he did not even turn pale, but
						remained undisturbed by all the clamour which
						arose in the city at the news of what had happened.
						In the theatre too he was singularly unmoved. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
						For
						instance, Nicostratus, who was nicknamed Clytemnestra, was once reading to him and Crates something from Homer; and, while Crates was deeply
						affected, he was no more moved than if he had
						not heard him. Altogether he was a man such as
						Melanthius the painter describes in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On
							Painting.</hi> There he says that a certain wilfulness
						and stubbornness should be stamped on works of
						art, and that the same holds good of character.
						Polemo used to say that we should exercise ourselves with facts and not with mere logical speculations, which leave us, like a man who has got by
						heart some paltry handbook on harmony but never
						practised, able, indeed, to win admiration for skill
						in asking questions, but utterly at variance with
						ourselves in the ordering of our lives.</p>
					<pb n='397'/>
					<p>He was, then, refined and generous, and would beg
						to be excused, in the words of Aristophanes about
						Euripides, the "acid, pungent style," 
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
						which, as the
						same author says, is "strong seasoning for meat when
						it is high."<note n='a'>Frag. 180 Dind.</note> Further, he would not,
						they say, even
						sit down to deal with the themes of his pupils, but
						would argue walking up and down. It was, then,
						for his love of what is noble that he was honoured
						in the state. Nevertheless would he withdraw from
						society
						<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi>i. &sect; 112 note.</note>
						and confine himself to the Garden of the
						Academy, while close by his scholars made themselves little huts and lived not far from the shrine of
						the Muses and the lecture-hall. It would seem that
						in all respects Polemo emulated Xenocrates. And
						Aristippus in the fourth book of his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the
							Luxury of the Ancients</hi> affirms him to have been his
						favourite. Certainly he always kept his predecessor
						before his mind and, like him, wore that simple
						austere dignity which is proper to the Dorian mode.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
						He loved Sophocles, particularly in those passages
						where it seemed as if, in the phrase of the comic
						poet,</p>
					<p>A stout Molossian mastiff lent him aid,</p>

					<p>He died at an advanced age of gradual decay,

					<p>Crates, whose father was Antigenes, was an
						Athenian belonging to the deme of Thria. He was
						a pupil and at the same time a favourite of Polemo,
						whom he succeeded in the headship of the school.
						The two were so much attached to each other that
						they not only shared the same pursuits in life but
						grew more and more alike to their latest breath, and,

					<p>According to Apollodorus in the third book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, Crates at his death left behind him

						some of a philosophical kind, others on comedy,

					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
					<p>Crantor of Soli, though he was much esteemed in
						his native country, left it for Athens and attended
						the lectures of Xenocrates at the same time as
						Polemo. He left memoirs extending to 30,000
						lines, some of which are by some critics attributed
						to Arcesilaus. He is said to have been asked what
						it was in Polemo that attracted him, and to have
					<pb n='403'/>
					replied, "The fact that I never heard him raise or
						lower his voice in speaking." He happened to fall
						ill, and retired to the temple of Asclepius, where he
						proceeded to walk about. At once people flocked
						round him in the belief that he had retired thither,
						not on account of illness, but in order to open a
						school. Among them was Arcesilaus, who wished to
						be introduced by his means to Polemo, notwithstanding the affection which united the two, as will be
						related in the Life of Arcesilaus. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
						However, when
						he recovered, he continued to attend Polemo's
						lectures, and for this he was universally praised. He
						is also said to have left Arcesilaus his property, to
						the value of twelve talents. And when asked by
						him where he wished to be buried, he answered<note n='a'>Nauck,

					<p>It is also said that he wrote poems and deposited
						them under seal in the temple of Athena in his
						native place. And Theaetetus the poet writes thus
						of him<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> ii. 28.</note>:</p>
					<p>Pleasing to men, more pleasing to the Muses, lived Crantor,
						and never saw old age. Receive, O earth, the hallowed

					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
					<p>Crantor admired Homer and Euripides above all
						other poets; it is hard, he said, at once to write
						tragedy and to stir the emotions in the language of
						everyday life. And he would quote the line from
						the story of Bellerophon<note n='c'>Nauck,
							<hi

							<hi

					<p>And it is said that there are extant<note n='d'><hi
						rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iii. 60.</note> these lines of the
						poet Antagoras, spoken by Crantor on Love:
					<pb n='405'/>
					My mind is in doubt, since thy birth is disputed, whether
						I am to call thee, Love, the first of the immortal gods, the
						eldest of all the children whom old Erebus and queenly

						or art thou the child of wise Cypris, or of Earth, or of the
						Winds? So many are the goods and ills thou devisest for
						men in thy wanderings. Therefore hast thou a body of
						double form.</p>
					<p>He was also clever at inventing terms. For instance, he said of a tragic player's voice that it
						was unpolished and unpeeled. And of a certain poet
						that his verses abounded in miserliness. And that
						the disquisitions of Theophrastus were written with
						an oyster-shell. His most highly esteemed work is

					<head>Chapter 6. ARCESILAUS (c. 318-242 B.C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
					<p>Arcesilaus, the son of Seuthes, according to Apollodorus in the third book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, came
						from
						Pitane in Aeolis. With him begins the Middle
						Academy; he was the first to suspend his judgement
						owing to the contradictions of opposing arguments.
						He was also the first to argue on both sides of a
						question, and the first to meddle with the system
						handed down by Plato and, by means of question
						and answer, to make it more closely resemble eristic.</p>
					<pb n='407'/>
					<p>He came across Crantor in this way. He was the
						youngest of four brothers, two of them being his
						brothers by the same father, and two by the same
						mother. Of the last two Pylades was the elder, and
						of the former two Moereas, and Moereas was his
						guardian. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
						At first, before he left Pitane for Athens,
						he was a pupil of the mathematician Autolycus, his
						fellow-countryman, and with him he also travelled
						to Sardis. Next he studied under Xanthus, the
						musician, of Athens; then he was a pupil of Theophrastus. Lastly, he crossed over to the Academy
						and joined Crantor. For while his brother Moereas,
						who has already been mentioned, wanted to make
						him a rhetorician, he was himself devoted to philosophy, and Crantor, being enamoured of him, cited
						the line from the
						<hi rend='ital'>Andromeda</hi> of Euripides<note
							n='a'>Nauck,
							<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>,
							<hi
								rend='ital'>Eur.</hi> 129.</note>:</p>
					<p>O maiden, if I save thee, wilt thou be grateful to me?</p>
					<p>and was answered with the next line<note n='b'><hi
						rend='ital'>Ib.</hi> 132.</note>:</p>
					<p>Take me, stranger, whether for maidservant or for wife.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
					<p>After that they lived together. Whereupon Theophrastus, nettled at his loss, is said to have remarked,
						"What a quick-witted and ready pupil has left my
						school!" For, besides being most effective in argument and decidedly fond of writing books, he also
						took up poetry. And there is extant an epigram of
						his upon Attalus which runs thus<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
							Plan.</hi> iii. 56.</note>:</p>
					<p>Pergamos, not famous in arms alone, is often celebrated
						for its steeds in divine Pisa. And if a mortal may make
						bold to utter the will of heaven, it will be much more sung
						by bards in days to come.</p>
					<pb n='409'/>
					<p>And again upon Menodorus, the favourite of
						Eugamus, one of his fellow-students<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
						Plan.</hi> ii. 382.</note>:</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
					<p>Far, far away are Phrygia and sacred Thyatira, thy
						native land, Menodorus, son of Cadanus. But to unspeakable Acheron the ways are equal, from whatever place they be
						measured, as the proverb saith. To thee Eugamus raised
						this far-seen monument, for thou wert dearest to him of all
						who for him toiled.</p>
					<p>He esteemed Homer above all the poets and would
						always read a passage from him before going to
						sleep. And in the morning he would say, whenever
						he wanted to read Homer, that he would pay a visit
						to his dear love. Pindar too he declared matchless
						for imparting fullness of diction and for affording a
						copious store of words and phrases. And in his youth
						he made a special study of Ion.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
					<p>He also attended the lectures of the geometer
						Hipponicus, at whom he pointed a jest as one who
						was in all besides a listless, yawning sluggard but
						yet proficient in his subject. "Geometry," he said,
						"must have flown into his mouth while it was agape."
						When this man's mind gave way, Arcesilaus took him
						to his house and nursed him until he was completely
						restored. He took over the school on the death of
						Crates, a certain Socratides having retired in his
						favour. According to some, one result of his suspending judgement on all matters was that he never
						so much as wrote a book.<note n='b'>If this be so, the study of the
							poet Ion
							( &sect; 31) must have remained unpublished.</note>
						Others relate that he was
						caught revising some works of Crantor, which
						according to some he published, according to others
						he burnt. He would seem to have held Plato in
						admiration, and he possessed a copy of his works.
						<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
						Some represent him as emulous of Pyrrho as well.
						He was devoted to dialectic and adopted the methods
					<pb n='411'/>
					of argument introduced by the Eretrian school. On
						account of this Ariston said of him:</p>
					<p>Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus.<note
						n='a'>A parody of Homer,
						<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> vi. 181: a chimaera
						has a lion's
						front, a dragon's tail, and the body of a goat.</note></p>
					<p>And Timon speaks of him thus<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
						Hom.
						<hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> v. 346.</note>:</p>
					<p>Having the lead of Menedemus at his heart, he will run
						either to that mass of flesh, Pyrrho, or to Diodorus.</p>
					<p>And a little farther on he introduces him as saying:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'>I shall swim to Pyrrho and to crooked
						Diodorus.</hi></p>
					<p>He was highly axiomatic and concise, and in his discourse fond of distinguishing the meaning of terms.
						He was satirical enough, and outspoken.
						<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
						This is why
						Timon speaks of him again as follows:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'>And mixing sound sense with wily cavils.<note
						n='c'>Or possibly with Wachsmuth: "mixing jest in wily
						fashion (<foreign lang='greek'>ai(muli/ws</foreign>) with
						abuse."</note></hi></p>
					<p>Hence, when a young man talked more boldly
						than was becoming, Arcesilaus exclaimed, "Will no
						one beat him at a game of knuckle-bone?" Again,
						when some one of immodest life denied that one
						thing seemed to him greater than another, he
						rejoined, "Then six inches and ten inches are all
						the same to you?" There was a certain Hemon,
						a Chian, who, though ugly, fancied himself to be
						handsome, and always went about in fine clothes.
						He having propounded as his opinion that the wise
						man will never fall in love, Arcesilaus replied,
						"What, not with one so handsome as you and so
						handsomely dressed?" And when one of loose life,
						to imply that Arcesilaus was arrogant, addressed
						him thus<note n='d'>Nauck,
							<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi

					<p>Of another who talked much nonsense he said that
						he could not have had even a nurse to scold him.
						And some persons he would not so much as answer.
						To a money-lending student, upon his confessing
						ignorance of something or other, Arcesilaus replied
						with two lines from the
						<hi rend='ital'>Oenomaus</hi> of Sophocles<note

					<p>A certain dialectic, a follower of Alexinus, was
						unable to repeat properly some argument of his
						teacher, whereupon Arcesilaus reminded him of the
						story of Philoxenus and the brickmakers. He found
						them singing some of his melodies out of tune; so he
						retaliated by trampling on the bricks they were
						making, saying, "If you spoil my work, I'll spoil
						yours." He was, moreover, genuinely annoyed with
						any who took up their studies too late. By some
						natural impulse he was betrayed into using such
						phrases as "I assert," and "So-and-so" (mentioning
						the name) "will not assent to this."<note n='e'>The use of these
							phrases was inconsistent with the
							suspension of judgement professed by Arcesilaus.</note> And this
						trait
					<pb n='415'/>
					many of his pupils imitated, as they did also his
					style of speaking and his whole address.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
					<p>Very fertile in invention, he could meet objection
						acutely or bring the course of discussion back to
						the point at issue, and fit it to every occasion.
						In persuasiveness he had no equal, and this all the
						more drew pupils to the school, although they were
						in terror of his pungent wit. But they willingly put
						up with that; for his goodness was extraordinary,
						and he inspired his pupils with hopes. He showed
						the greatest generosity in private life, being ever
						ready to confer benefits, yet most modestly anxious
						to conceal the favour. For instance, he once called
						upon Ctesibius when he was ill and, seeing in what
						straits he was, quietly put a purse under his pillow.
						He, when he found it, said, "This is the joke of
						Arcesilaus." Moreover, on another occasion, he sent
						him 1000 drachmas.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
					<p>Again, by introducing Archias the Arcadian to
						Eumenes, he caused him to be advanced to great
						dignity. And, as he was very liberal, caring very
						little for money, so he was the first to attend performances where seats were paid for, and he was above all
						eager to go to those of Archecrates and Callicrates, for
						which the fee was a gold piece. And he helped many
						people and collected subscriptions for them. Some one
						once borrowed his silver plate in order to entertain
						friends and never brought it back, but Arcesilaus did
						not ask him for it and pretended it had not been
						borrowed. Another version of the story is that he lent
						it on purpose, and, when it was returned, made the
						borrower a present of it because he was poor. He
						had property in Pitane from which his brother
						Pylades sent him supplies. Furthermore, Eumenes,
					<pb n='417'/>
					the son of Philetaerus, furnished him with large sums,
						and for this reason Eumenes was the only one of
						the contemporary kings to whom he dedicated any
						of his works.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
					<p>And whereas many persons courted Antigonus and
						went to meet him whenever he came to Athens,
						Arcesilaus remained at home, not wishing to thrust
						himself upon his acquaintance. He was on the best
						of terms with Hierocles, the commandant in Munichia
						and Piraeus, and at every festival would go down to
						see him. And though Hierocles joined in urging
						him to pay his respects to Antigonus, he was not
						prevailed upon, but, after going as far as the gates,
						turned back. And after the battle at sea,<note n='a'>The reference may
							be to one of the naval victories gained
							by Antigonus over the Egyptian fleet towards the end of
							his reign, at Cos and again at Andros. See W. W. Tarn,
							<hi rend='ital'>Antigonus Gonatas</hi>, pp. 378, 461-6.</note> when
						many went to Antigonus or wrote him flattering
						letters, he held his peace. However, on behalf of
						his native city, he did go to Demetrias as envoy to
						Antigonus, but failed in his mission. He spent his
						time wholly in the Academy, shunning politics.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
					<p>Once indeed, when at Athens, he stopped too long
						in the Piraeus, discussing themes, out of friendship
						for Hierocles, and for this he was censured by certain

						another
						Aristippus, and he was fond of dining well, but only
						with those who shared his tastes. He lived openly
						with Theodete and Phila, the Elean courtesans, and
						to those who censured him he quoted the maxims of
						Aristippus. He was also fond of boys and very
						susceptible. Hence he was accused by Ariston of
					<pb n='419'/>
					Chios, the Stoic, and his followers, who called him a
						corrupter of youth and a shameless teacher of
						immorality. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
						He is said to have been particularly

						of Cleochares of Myrlea; of him the story is told

						told them that for his part he was willing to admit
						them but that Cleochares would not let him. This
						same youth had amongst his admirers Demochares
						the son of Laches, and Pythocles the son of Bugelus,
						and once when Arcesilaus had caught them, with
						great forbearance he ordered them off. For all this
						he was assailed and ridiculed by the critics abovementioned, as a friend of the mob who courted
						popularity. The most virulent attacks were made
						upon him in the circle of Hieronymus the Peripatetic,<note

						whenever he collected his friends to keep the birthday of Halcyoneus, son of Antigonus, an occasion
						for which Antigonus used to send large sums of
						money to be spent in merrymaking.
						<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
						There he had
						always shunned discussion over the wine; and when
						Aridices, proposing a certain question, requested
						him to speak upon it, he replied, "The peculiar
						province of philosophy is just this, to know that there
						is a time for all things." As to the charge brought
						against him that he was the friend of the mob, Timon,
						among many other things, has the following<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf. infra</hi>, v. 59.</note>:</p>
					<p>So saying, he plunged into the surrounding crowd. And
						they were amazed at him, like chaffinches about an owl,

					<p>And yet for all that he was modest enough to
					<pb n='421'/>
					recommend his pupils to hear other philosophers.
						And when a certain youth from Chios was not well
						pleased with his lectures and preferred those of
						the above-mentioned Hieronymus, Arcesilaus himself
						took him and introduced him to that philosopher,
						with an injunction to behave well.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
					<p>Another pleasant story told of him is this. Some
						one had inquired why it was that pupils from all the
						other schools went over to Epicurus, but converts
						were never made from the Epicureans: "Because
						men may become eunuchs, but a eunuch never
						becomes a man," was his answer.</p>
					<p>At last, being near his end, he left all his property
						to his brother Pylades, because, unknown to Moereas,
						he had taken him to Chios and thence brought him
						to Athens. In all his life he never married nor had
						any children. He made three wills: the first he
						left at Eretria in the charge of Amphicritus, the
						second at Athens in the charge of certain friends,
						while the third he dispatched to his home to
						Thaumasias, one of his relatives, with the request
						that he would keep it safe. To this man he also
						wrote as follows:</p>
					<p>"Arcesilaus to Thaumasias greeting.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
					<p>"I have given Diogenes my will to be conveyed

						should not suffer by my decease. You are the most

					<p>He died, according to Hermippus, through drinking
						too freely of unmixed wine which affected his reason;
						he was already seventy-five and regarded by the
						Athenians with unparalleled good-will.</p>

					<p>In truth Bion was in other respects a shifty
						character, a subtle sophist, and one who had given
						the enemies of philosophy many an occasion to
						blaspheme, while in certain respects he was even
						pompous and able to indulge in arrogance. He left
						very many memoirs, and also sayings of useful
						application. For example, when he was reproached
						for not paying court to a youth, his excuse was,
						"You can't get hold of a soft cheese with a hook."
						<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
						Being once asked who suffers most from anxiety, he
					<pb n='427'/>
					replied, "He who is ambitious of the greatest prosperity." Being consulted by some one as to whether
						he should marry--for this story is also told of Bion--
						he made answer, "If the wife you marry be ugly,
						she will be your bane; if beautiful, you will not
						keep her to yourself."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra</hi>, vi.
							3.</note> He called old age the
						harbour of all ills; at least they all take refuge
						there. Renown he called the mother of virtues;
						beauty another's good; wealth the sinews of success.
						To some one who had devoured his patrimony he
						said, "The earth swallowed Amphiaraus, but you
						have swallowed your land." To be unable to bear
						an ill is itself a great ill. He used to condemn those
						who burnt men alive as if they could not feel, and
						yet cauterized them as if they could. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
						He used
						repeatedly to say that to grant favours to another
						was preferable to enjoying the favours of others.
						For the latter means ruin to both body and soul.
						He even abused Socrates, declaring that, if he felt
						desire for Alcibiades and abstained, he was a fool; if he
						did not, his conduct was in no way remarkable. The
						road to Hades, he used to say, was easy to travel;
						at any rate men passed away with their eyes shut.
						He said in censure of Alcibiades that in his boyhood
						he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as
						a young man the wives from their husbands. When
						the Athenians were absorbed in the practice of
						rhetoric, he taught philosophy at Rhodes. To some
						one who found fault with him for this he replied,
						"How can I sell barley when what I brought to
						market is wheat?"</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
					<p>He used to say that those in Hades would be
						more severely punished if the vessels in which they
						drew water were whole instead of being pierced with
					<pb n='429'/>
					holes. To an importunate talker who wanted his
						help he said, "I will satisfy your demand, if you will
						only get others to plead your cause and stay away
						yourself." On a voyage in bad company he fell in
						with pirates. When his companions said, "We are
						lost if we are discovered," "And I too," he replied,
						"unless I am discovered." Conceit he styled a
						hindrance to progress. Referring to a wealthy miser
						he said, "He has not acquired a fortune; the fortune
						has acquired him." Misers, he said, took care of
						property as if it belonged to them, but derived no
						more benefit from it than if it belonged to others.
						"When we are young," said he, "we are courageous,
						but it is only in old age that prudence is at its height."
						<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
						Prudence, he said, excels the other virtues as much
						as sight excels the other senses. He used to say
						that we ought not to heap reproaches on old age,
						seeing that, as he said, we all hope to reach it. To
						a slanderer who showed a grave face his words were,
						"I don't know whether you have met with ill luck,
						or your neighbour with good." He used to say that
						low birth made a bad partner for free speech, for--</p>

					<p>We ought, he remarked, to watch our friends and
						see what manner of men they are, in order that we
						may not be thought to associate with the bad or to
						decline the friendship of the good.</p>
					<p>Bion at the outset used to deprecate the Academic
						doctrines,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> he had his doubts.
							Reiske, however, by his conjecture

						was a pupil of

						donning cloak and wallet. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
						For little else was needed
						to convert him to the doctrine of entire insensibility.</p>
					<pb n='431'/>
					<p>Next he went over to Theodorean views, after he
						had heard the lectures of Theodorus the Atheist,
						who used every kind of sophistical argument. And
						after Theodorus he attended the lectures of Theophrastus the Peripatetic. He was fond of display
						and great at cutting up anything with a jest, using
						vulgar names for things. Because he employed every
						style of speech in combination, Eratosthenes, we
						hear, said of him that he was the first to deck
						philosophy with bright-flowered robes. He was
						clever also at parody. Here is a specimen of his
						style:</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
					<p>And in general he made sport of music and geometry.
						He lived extravagantly, and for this reason he
						would move from one city to another, sometimes
						contriving to make a great show. Thus at Rhodes
						he persuaded the sailors to put on students' garb
						and follow in his train. And when, attended by
						them, he made his way into the gymnasium, all
						eyes were fixed on him. It was his custom also to
						adopt certain young men for the gratification of his
						appetite and in order that he might be protected
						by their goodwill.<note n='b'>See, however,
							<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>,

						insisted strongly on the maxim that "friends share in
						common." And hence it came about that he is not
						credited with a single disciple, out of all the crowds
						who attended his lectures. And yet there were
						some who followed his lead in shamelessness. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
						For
						instance, Betion, one of his intimates, is said once to
						have addressed Menedemus in these words: "For
						my part, Menedemus, I pass the night with Bion,
						and I don't think I am any the worse for it." In
					<pb n='433'/>
					his familiar talk he would often vehemently assail
						belief in the gods, a taste which he had derived from
						Theodorus. Afterwards, when he fell ill (so it was
						said by the people of Chalcis where he died), he was
						persuaded to wear an amulet and to repent of his
						offences against religion. And even for want of
						nurses he was in a sad plight, until Antigonus sent
						him two servants. And it is stated by Favorinus
						in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> that the king himself
						followed in a litter.</p>
					<p>Even so he died, and in these lines<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.

						him to task:</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
					<p>We hear that Bion, to whom the Scythian land of Borysthenes gave birth, denied that the gods really exist. Had
						he persisted in holding this opinion, it would have been right
						to say, "He thinks as he pleases: wrongly, to be sure, but
						still he does think so." But in fact, when he fell ill of a
						lingering disease and feared death, he who denied the existence of the gods, and would not even look at a temple, 
						<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
						who
						often mocked at mortals for sacrificing to deities, not only over
						hearth and high altars and table, with sweet savour and fat
						and incense did he gladden the nostrils of the gods; nor
						was he content to say "I have sinned, forgive the past,"
						<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
						but he cheerfully allowed an old woman to put a charm
						round his neck, and in full faith bound his arms with leather
						and placed the rhamnus and the laurel-branch over the
						door, being ready to submit to anything sooner than die.
						Fool for wishing that the divine favour might be purchased
						at a certain price, as if the gods existed just when Bion chose
						to recognize them! It was then with vain wisdom that,
						when the driveller was all ashes, he stretched out his hand
						and said "Hail, Pluto, hail!"</p>
					<pb n='435'/>

					<p>Ten men have borne the name of Bion: (1) the

					<p>Lacydes, son of Alexander, was a native of Cyrene
						He was the founder of the New Academy and the
						successor of Arcesilaus: a man of very serious
						character who found numerous admirers; industrious
						from his youth up and, though poor, of pleasant
						manners and pleasant conversation. A most amusing
						story is told of his housekeeping. Whenever he
						brought anything out of the store-room, he would
						seal the door up again and throw his signet-ring
						inside through the opening, to ensure that nothing
						laid up there should be stolen or carried off. So
						soon, then, as his rogues of servants got to know this,
						they broke the seal and carried off what they pleased,
						afterwards throwing the ring in the same way through
					<pb n='437'/>
					the opening into the store-room. Nor were they ever
					detected in this.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
					<p>Lacydes used to lecture in the Academy, in the
						garden which had been laid out by King Attalus,
						and from him it derived its name of Lacydeum. He
						did what none of his predecessors had ever done;
						in his lifetime he handed over the school to Telecles
						and Evander, both of Phocaea. Evander was succeeded by Hegesinus of Pergamum, and he again by
						Carneades. A good saying is attributed to Lacydes.
						When Attalus sent for him, he is said to have
						remarked that statues are best seen from a distance.
						He stadied geometry late, and some one said to him,
						"Is this a proper time?" To which he replied,
						"Nay, is it not even yet the proper time?"</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
					<p>He assumed the headship of the school in the

					<head>Chapter 9. CARNEADES (c. 213-129 B C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
					<p>Carneades, the son of Epicomus or (according
						to Alexander in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>)
						of
						Philocomus, was a native of Cyrene. He studied
					<pb n='439'/>
					carefully the writings of the Stoics and particularly
						those of Chrysippus, and by combating these successfully he became so famous that he would often say:</p>
					<p><hi rend='center'>Without Chrysippus where should I have
						been?</hi></p>
					<p>The man's industry was unparalleled, although in
						physics he was not so strong as in ethics. Hence he
						would let his hair and nails grow long from intense
						devotion to study. Such was his predominance in
						philosophy that even the rhetoricians would dismiss
						their classes and repair to him to hear him lecture.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
					<p>His voice was extremely powerful, so that the
						keeper of the gymnasium sent to him and requested
						him not to shout so loud. To which he replied,
						"Then give me something by which to regulate
						my voice." Thereupon by a happy hit the man
						replied in the words, "You have a regulator in your
						audience." His talent for criticizing opponents was
						remarkable, and he was a formidable controversialist.
						And for the reasons already given he further declined
						invitations to dine out. One of his pupils was Mentor
						the Bithynian, who tried to ingratiate himself with
						a concubine of Carneades; so on one occasion
						(according to Favorinus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
							History</hi>),
						when Mentor came to lecture, Carneades in the
						course of his remarks let fall these lines by way of
						parody at his expense:</p>

					<p>Hither comes an old man of the sea, infallible, like to

					<p>He seems to have shown some want of courage in
						the face of death, repeating often the words, "Nature
						which framed this whole will also destroy it." When
						he learnt that Antipater committed suicide by
						drinking a potion, he was greatly moved by the
						constancy with which he met his end, and exclaimed,
						"Give it then to me also." And when those about
						him asked "What?" "A honeyed draught," said
						he. At the time he died the moon is said to have
						been eclipsed, and one might well say that the
						brightest luminary in heaven next to the sun thereby
						gave token of her sympathy.</p>

						departed this life in the fourth year of the 162nd

						years. Letters
						of his to Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, are extant.
						Everything else was compiled by his pupils; he
						himself left nothing in writing. I have written upon
						him in logaoedic metre as follows<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
							Plan.</hi> v. 39.</note>:</p>
					<p>Why, Muse, oh why wouldst thou have me censure
						Carneades? For he is ignorant who knoweth not how he

						diseases, he would not find release. But when he heard
						that Antipater's life was quenched by drinking a potion,
						<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
						"Give me too," he cried, "a draught to drink." "What?
						pray what?" "Give me a draught of honeyed wine."
						He had often on his lips the words, "Nature which holds
						this frame together will surely dissolve it." None the less
						he too went down to the grave, and he might have got there
						sooner by cutting short his tale of woes.</p>
					<p>It is said that his eyes went blind at night without

					his knowing it, and he ordered the slave to light the

						a pupil of Carneades. And Carneades, recognizing

						diligence go that he composed more than four

					<p>Aristotle, son of Nicomachus and Phaestis, was

						his descent from Nicomachus who was the son of
						Machaon and grandson of Asclepius; and he resided
						with Amyntas, the king of Macedon, in the capacity

						from Timotheus the Athenian in his book
						<hi rend='ital'>On Lives</hi>;
						further, his calves were slender (so they say), his
						eyes small, and he was conspicuous by his attire, his

						Timaeus, he had a son by Herpyllis, his concubine,
						who was also called Nicomachus.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>

					<pb n='447'/>
					up and down discussing philosophy with his pupils
						until it was time to rub themselves with oil. Hence

					<p>He also taught his pupils to discourse upon a set
						theme, besides practising them in oratory. Afterwards, however, he departed to Hermias the eunuch,

						petitioned Alexander to restore his native city which
						had been destroyed by Philip and obtained his
					<pb n='449'/>
					request; and that he also drew up a code of laws for
						the inhabitants. We learn further that, following the
						example of Xenocrates, he made it a rule in his
						school that every ten days a new president should be
						appointed. When he thought that he had stayed
						long enough with Alexander, he departed to Athens,
						having first presented to Alexander his kinsman
						Callisthenes of Olynthus. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
						But when Callisthenes

					<p>O virtue, toilsome for the generation of mortals to achieve,

					<p>Such then was the life of the philosopher. I have
						also come across his will, which is worded thus:</p>
					<p>"All will be well; but, in case anything should
						happen, Aristotle has made these dispositions.
						Antipater is to be executor in all matters and in
						general; 
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
						but, until Nicanor shall arrive, Aristomenes,
						Timarchus, Hipparchus, Dioteles and (if he consent
						and if circumstances permit him) Theophrastus shall
						take charge as well of Herpyllis and the children as
						of the property. And when the girl shall be grown
						up she shall be given in marriage to Nicanor; but
						if anything happen to the girl (which heaven forbid
						and no such thing will happen) before her marriage,
						or when she is married but before there are children,
						Nicanor shall have full powers, both with regard to
						the child and with regard to everything else, to
						administer in a manner worthy both of himself and
						of us. Nicanor shall take charge of the girl and of
						the boy Nicomachus as he shall think fit in all that
						concerns them as if he were father and brother.
						And if anything should happen to Nicanor (which
						heaven forbid!) either before he marries the girl, or
					<pb n='457'/>
					when he has married her but before there are children, any arrangements that he may make shall be
						valid.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
						And if Theophrastus is willing to live with her,
						he shall have the same rights as Nicanor. Otherwise the executors in consultation with Antipater
						shall administer as regards the daughter and the boy
						as seems to them to be best. The executors and
						Nicanor, in memory of me and of the steady affection
						which Herpyllis has borne towards me, shall take
						care of her in every other respect and, if she desires
						to be married, shall see that she be given to one
						not unworthy; and besides what she has already
						received they shall give her a talent of silver out of
						the estate and three handmaids whomsoever she
						shall choose besides the maid she has at present and
						the man-servant Pyrrhaeus; 
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
						and if she chooses to
						remain at Chalcis, the lodge by the garden, if in
						Stagira, my father's house. Whichever of these two
						houses she chooses, the executors shall furnish with
						such furniture as they think proper and as Herpyllis
						herself may approve. Nicanor shall take charge of
						the boy Myrmex, that he be taken to his own friends
						in a manner worthy of me with the property of his
						which we received. Ambracis shall be given her
						freedom, and on my daughter's marriage shall
						receive 500 drachmas and the maid whom she now
						has. And to Thale shall be given, in addition
						to the maid whom she has and who was bought,
						a thousand drachmas and a maid. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
						And Simon, in
						addition to the money before paid to him towards
						another servant, shall either have a servant purchased
						for him or receive a further sum of money. And
						Tycho, Philo, Olympius and his child shall have their
						freedom when my daughter is married. None of
					<pb n='459'/>
					the servants who waited upon me shall be sold but
						they shall continue to be employed; and when
						they arrive at the proper age they shall have their
						freedom if they deserve it. My executors shall see to
						it, when the images which Gryllion has been commissioned to execute are finished, that they be set
						up, namely that of Nicanor, that of Proxenus, which
						it was my intention to have executed, and that of
						Nicanor's mother; also they shall set up the bust
						which has been executed of Arimnestus, to be a
						memorial of him seeing that he died childless, 
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
						and
						shall dedicate my mother's statue to Demeter at
						Nemea or wherever they think best. And wherever
						they bury me, there the bones of Pythias shall be
						laid, in accordance with her own instructions. And
						to commemorate Nicanor's safe return, as I vowed
						on his behalf, they shall set up in Stagira stone
						statues of life size to Zeus and Athena the Saviours."<note n='a'>The

					<p>Such is the tenor of Aristotle's will. It is said that
						a very large number of dishes belonging to him were
						found, and that Lyco mentioned his bathing in a
						bath of warm oil and then selling the oil. Some
						relate that he placed a skin of warm oil on his
						stomach, and that, when he went to sleep, a bronze
						ball was placed in his hand with a vessel under it,
						in order that, when the ball dropped from his hand
						into the vessel, he might be waked up by the sound.<note n='b'>Next

					<pb n='461'/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<p>Some exceedingly happy sayings are attributed
						to him, which I proceed to quote. To the question,
						"What do people gain by telling lies?" his answer
						was, "Just this, that when they speak the truth
						they are not believed." Being once reproached for
						giving alms to a bad man, he rejoined, "It was the
						man and not his character that I pitied."
						<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra,</hi>&sect; 21.</note>
						He used constantly to say to his friends and pupils, whenever
						or wherever he happened to be lecturing, "As sight
						takes in light from the surrounding air, so does the
						soul from mathematics." Frequently and at some
						length he would say that the Athenians were the
						discoverers of wheat and of laws; but, though they
						used wheat, they had no use for laws.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
					<p>"The roots of education," he said, "are bitter,
						but the fruit is sweet." Being asked, "What is it
						that soon grows old?" he answered, "Gratitude."
						He was asked to define hope, and he replied, "It is
						a waking dream." When Diogenes offered him dried
						figs, he saw that he had prepared something caustic
						to say if he did not take them; so he took them
						and said Diogenes had lost his figs and his jest into
						the bargain. And on another occasion he took them
						when they were offered, lifted them up aloft, as you
						do babies, and returned them with the exclamation,
						"Great is Diogenes." Three things he declared to
						be indispensable for education: natural endowment,
						study, and constant practice. On hearing that some
						one abused him, he rejoined, "He may even scourge
						me so it be in my absence." Beauty he declared to
						be a greater recommendation than any letter of
						introduction. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
						Others attribute this definition to
						Diogenes; Aristotle, they say, defined good looks
						as the gift of god, Socrates as a short-lived reign,
					<pb n='463'/>
					Plato as natural superiority, Theophrastus as a mute
						deception, Theocritus as an evil in an ivory setting,
						Carneades as a monarchy that needs no bodyguard.
						Being asked how the educated differ from the uneducated, "As much," he said, "as the living from
						the dead."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> i. &sect; 69, ii.
							&sect; 69.</note>
						He used to declare education to be an
						ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.
						Teachers who educated children deserved, he said,
						more honour than parents who merely gave them
						birth; for bare life is furnished by the one, the
						other ensures a good life. To one who boasted that
						he belonged to a great city his reply was, "That is
						not the point to consider, but who it is that is worthy
						of a great country." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
						To the query, "What is a
						friend?" his reply was, "A single soul dwelling in
						two bodies." Mankind, he used to say, were divided
						into those who were as thrifty as if they would live
						for ever, and those who were as extravagant as if
						they were going to die the next day. When some one
						inquired why we spend much time with the beautiful,
						"That," he said, "is a blind man's question." When
						asked what advantage he had ever gained from
						philosophy, he replied, "This, that I do without
						being ordered what some are constrained to do by
						their fear of the law."<note n='b'>Cicero ascribed a similar reply to
							Xenocrates: "ut id sua
							sponte facerent, quod cogerentur facere legibus"
							(Cic.
							<hi rend='ital'>De rep.</hi>
							i. &sect; 3).</note> The question being put,
						how can students make progress, he replied, "By
						pressing hard on those in front and not waiting for
						those behind." To the chatterbox who poured out
						a flood of talk upon him and then inquired, "Have
						I bored you to death with my chatter?" he replied,
						"No, indeed; for I was not attending to you."

						When some one accused him of having given a subscription to a dishonest man--for the story is also

					told in this form
						<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi>
							&sect;
							17.</note>--"It was not the man," said he,
						"that I assisted, but humanity." To the question
						how we should behave to friends, he answered, "As
						we should wish them to behave to us." Justice he
						defined as a virtue of soul which distributes according
						to merit. Education he declared to be the best
						provision for old age. Favorinus in the second book
						of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> mentions as one of his habitual
						sayings that "He who has friends can have no true
						friend." Further, this is found in the seventh book

					<p>Such is the number of the works written by him.
						And in them he puts forward the following views.
						There are two divisions of philosophy, the practical
						and the theoretical. The practical part includes
						ethics and politics, and in the latter not only the
						doctrine of the state but also that of the household
						is sketched. The theoretical part includes physics
						and logic, although logic is not an independent
						science, but is elaborated as an instrument to the
						rest of science. And he clearly laid down that it
						has a twofold aim, probability and truth. For each
						of these he employed two faculties, dialectic and
						rhetoric where probability is aimed at, analytic and
					<pb n='477'/>
					philosophy where the end is truth; he neglects
						nothing which makes either for discovery or for
						judgement or for utility. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
						As making for discovery
						he left in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Topics</hi> and
						<hi
							rend='ital'>Methodics</hi> a number of
						propositions, whereby the student can be well supplied with probable arguments for the solution of
						problems. As an aid to judgement he left the
						<hi rend='ital'>Prior</hi>
						and
						<hi rend='ital'>Posterior Analytics.</hi> By the Prior Analytics
						the
						premisses are judged, by the Posterior the process of
						inference is tested. For practical use there are the
						precepts on controversy and the works dealing with
						question and answer, with sophistical fallacies,
						syllogisms and the like. The test of truth which he
						put forward was sensation in the sphere of objects
						actually presented, but in the sphere of morals
						dealing with the state, the household and the laws,
						it was reason.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
					<p>The one ethical end he held to be the exercise
						of virtue in a completed life. And happiness he
						maintained to be made up of goods of three sorts:
						goods of the soul, which indeed he designates as
						of the highest value; in the second place bodily
						goods, health and strength, beauty and the like;
						and thirdly external goods, such as wealth, good
						birth, reputation and the like. And he regarded
						virtue as not of itself sufficient to ensure happiness;
						bodily goods and external goods were also necessary,
						for the wise man would be miserable if he lived in
						the midst of pains, poverty, and similar circumstances.
						Vice, however, is sufficient in itself to secure misery,
						even if it be ever so abundantly furnished with
						corporeal and external goods. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
						He held that the
						virtues are not mutually interdependent. For a man
						might be prudent, or again just, and at the same
					<pb n='479'/>
					time profligate and unable to control his passions.
						He said too that the wise man was not exempt from
						all passions, but indulged them in moderation.</p>
					<p>He defined friendship as an equality of reciprocal
						good-will, including under the term as one species
						the friendship of kinsmen, as another that of lovers,
						and as a third that of host and guest.
						<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> iii. 81. and Aristotle,

						The end of love was not merely intercourse but also philosophy.
						According to him the wise man would fall in love
						and take part in politics; furthermore he would
						marry and reside at a king's court. Of three kinds
						of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the
						pleasure-loving life, he gave the preference to the
						contemplative. He held that the studies which make
						up the ordinary education are of service for the
						attainment of virtue.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
					<p>In the sphere of natural science he surpassed all
						other philosophers in the investigation of causes, so
						that even the most insignificant phenomena were
						explained by him. Hence the unusual number of
						scientific notebooks which he compiled. Like Plato
						he held that God was incorporeal; that his providence extended to the heavenly bodies, that he is
						unmoved, and that earthly events are regulated by
						their affinity with them (the heavenly bodies).
						Besides the four elements he held that there is a
						fifth, of which the celestial bodies are composed.
						Its motion is of a different kind from that of the
						other elements, being circular. Further, he maintained the soul to be incorporeal, defining it as the
						first entelechy [<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> realization] of a natural
						organic
						body potentially possessed of life.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>De
						anima,</hi> ii. 1, 412 a 27.</note> 
						<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
						By the term
						realization he means that which has an incorporeal
						form. This realization, according to him, is twofold.</p>
					<pb n='481'/>
					<p>Either it is potential, as that of Hermes in the
						wax, provided the wax be adapted to receive the
						proper mouldings, or as that of the statue implicit
						in the bronze; or again it is determinate, which is
						the case with the completed figure of Hermes or
						the finished statue. The soul is the realization "of
						a natural body," since bodies may be divided into
						(a) artificial bodies made by the hands of craftsmen,
						as a tower or a ship, and (b) natural bodies which
						are the work of nature, such as plants and the bodies
						of animals. And when he said "organic" he meant
						constructed as means to an end, as sight is adapted
						for seeing and the ear for hearing. Of a body
						"potentially possessed of life," that is, in itself.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
					<p>There are two senses of "potential," one answering to a formed state and the other to its exercise
						in act. In the latter sense of the term he who is
						awake is said to have soul, in the former he who is
						asleep. It was then in order to include the sleeper
						that Aristotle added the word "potential."</p>
					<p>He held many other opinions on a variety of
						subjects which it would be tedious to enumerate.
						For altogether his industry and invention were remarkable, as is shown by the catalogue of his writings
						given above, which come to nearly 400 in number,
						<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> counting those only the genuineness of which
						is
						not disputed. For many other written works and
						pointed oral sayings are attributed to him.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
					<p>There were in all eight Aristotles: (1) our philosopher himself; (2) an Athenian statesman,<note n='a'>Probably this is
						the Aristotle who appears in Plato's
						dialogue
						<hi rend='ital'>Parmenides.</hi></note> the
						author of graceful forensic speeches; (3) a scholar
						who commented on the
						<hi rend='ital'>Iliad</hi>; (4) a Sicilian rhetorician, who wrote a reply to the Panegyric of Isocrates;
						(5) a disciple of Aeschines the Socratic philosopher,
					<pb n='483'/>
					surnamed Myth; (6) a native of Cyrene, who wrote
						upon the art of poetry; (7) a trainer of boys, mentioned by Aristoxenus in his Life of Plato; (8) an
						obscure grammarian, whose handbook
						<hi rend='ital'>On Redundancy</hi> is still extant.</p>
					<p>Aristotle of Stagira had many disciples; the most
						distinguished was Theophrastus, of whom we have
						next to speak.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="2" type="chapter">
					<head>Chapter 2. THEOPHRASTUS (c. 370-286 B.C.)
					(Head of the School from 323 B.C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
					<p>Theophrastus was a native of Eresus, the son of
						Melantes, a fuller, as stated by Athenodorus in the
						eighth book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Walks.</hi> He first heard his
						countryman Alcippus lecture in his native town and afterwards he heard Plato, whom he left for Aristotle.
						And when the latter withdrew to Chalcis he took
						over the school himself in the 114th Olympiad.<note n='a'>323
							b.c.</note>
						A slave of his named Pompylus is also said to have
						been a philosopher, according to Myronianus of
						Amastris in the first book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Historical
							Parallels.</hi>
						Theophrastus was a man of remarkable intelligence
						and industry and, as Pamphila says in the thirtysecond book of her
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, he taught Menander
						the comic poet. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
						Furthermore, he was ever ready
						to do a kindness and fond of discussion. Casander
						certainly granted him audience and Ptolemy made
						overtures to him. And so highly was he valued at
						Athens that, when Agnonides ventured to prosecute
						him for impiety, the prosecutor himself narrowly
						escaped punishment. About 2000 pupils used to
						attend his lectures. In a letter to Phanias the
					<pb n='485'/>
					Peripatetic, among other topics, he speaks of a
						tribunal as follows<note n='a'>In the extract from the letter
							Theophrastus seems to be
							considering the best means of preparing for publication what
							he has to say, possibly in lecture, before the large class
							which, as we have just been informed, sometimes numbered
							2000. It is difficult to see how this topic can have been
							worked into a letter on the law courts as such, and there is
							much to be said for Mr. Wyse's emendation
							<foreign lang='greek'>didaskali/ou.</foreign>
							If this be accepted, the whole letter would be about means
							or subjects of instruction in lecture.</note>: "To get a public or even
						a
						select circle such as one desires is not easy. If an
						author reads his work, he must re-write it. Always
						to shirk revision and ignore criticism is a course
						which the present generation of pupils will no longer
						tolerate." And in this letter he has called some
						one "pedant."</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
					<p>Although his reputation stood so high, nevertheless
						for a short time he had to leave the country with all
						the other philosophers, when Sophocles the son of
						Amphiclides proposed a law that no philosopher
						should preside over a school except by permission
						of the Senate and the people, under penalty of death.
						The next year, however, the philosophers returned,
						as Philo had prosecuted Sophocles for making an
						illegal proposal. Whereupon the Athenians repealed
						the law, fined Sophocles five talents, and voted the
						recall of the philosophers, in order that Theophrastus
						also might return and live there as before. He bore
						the name of Tyrtamus, and it was Aristotle who
						re-named him Theophrastus on account of his
						graceful style. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
						And Aristippus, in his fourth book
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Luxury of the Ancients</hi>, asserts that he was
						enamoured of Aristotle's son Nicomachus, although
						he was his teacher. It is said that Aristotle applied
						to him and Callisthenes what Plato had said of
						Xenocrates and himself (as already related), namely,
						that the one needed a bridle and the other a goad;
						for Theophrastus interpreted all his meaning with
					<pb n='487'/>
					an excess of cleverness, whereas the other was
						naturally backward. He is said to have become
						the owner of a garden of his own after Aristotle's
						death, through the intervention of his friend
						Demetrius of Phalerum. There are pithy sayings of
						his in circulation as follows: "An unbridled horse,"
						he said, "ought to be trusted sooner than a
						badly-arranged discourse." 
						<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
						To some one who never
						opened his lips at a banquet he remarked: "Yours
						is a wise course for an ignoramus, but in an educated
						man it is sheer folly." He used constantly to say
						that in our expenditure the item that costs most is
						time.</p>
					<p>He died at the age of eighty-five, not long after
						he had relinquished his labours. My verses upon
						him are these<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal</hi> vii.
							110.</note>:</p>
					<p>Not in vain was the word spoken to one of human kind,
						"Slacken the bow of wisdom and it breaks." Of a truth, so
						long as Theophrastus laboured he was sound of limb, but
						when released from toil his limbs failed him and he died.</p>
					<p>It is said that his disciples asked him if he had
						any last message for them, to which he replied:
						"Nothing else but this, that many of the pleasures
						which life boasts are but in the seeming. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
						For when
						we are just beginning to live, lo! we die. Nothing
						then is so unprofitable as the love of glory. Farewell,
						and may you be happy. Either drop my doctrine,
						which involves a world of labour, or stand forth its
						worthy champions, for you will win great glory.
						Life holds more disappointment than advantage.
						But, as I can no longer discuss what we ought to do,
						do you go on with the inquiry into right conduct."</p>
					<pb n='489'/>
					<p>With these words, they say, he breathed his last.
						And according to the story all the Athenians, out of
						respect for the man, escorted his bier on foot. And
						Favorinus tells that he had in his old age to be carried
						about in a litter<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> a similar
							statement about Bion, also attributed to
							Favorinus.</note>; and this he says on the authority
						of Hermippus, whose account is taken from a remark
						of Arcesilaus of Pitane to Lacydes of Cyrene.</p>

					<p>I have also come across his will, couched in the
						following terms:</p>
					<p>"All will be well; but in case anything should
						happen, I make these dispositions. I give and bequeath all my property at home<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> at

						of the trust funds at the disposal of Hipparchus
						<note n='b'>Mentioned below,

							for the School, which in the eye of the law was a religious
							foundation.</note>
						the following appropriations should be made. First,
						they should be applied to finish the rebuilding of
						the Museum with the statues of the goddesses, and
						to add any improvements which seem practicable to
						beautify them.<note n='c'>Evidently the Museum had suffered in some
							recent
							political troubles, perhaps the second siege of Athens by

						Secondly, to replace in the temple
						the bust of Aristotle with the rest of the dedicated
						offerings which formerly were in the temple. Next,
						to rebuild the small cloister adjoining the Museum
					<pb n='505'/>
					at least as handsomely as before, and to replace in
						the lower cloister the tablets containing maps of the
						countries traversed by explorers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
						Further, to repair
						the altar so that it may be perfect and elegant. It
						is also my wish that the statue of Nicomachus should
						be completed of life size. The price agreed upon
						for the making of the statue itself has been paid to
						Praxiteles, but the rest of the cost should be defrayed
						from the source above mentioned. The statue should
						be set up in whatever place seems desirable to the
						executors entrusted with carrying out my other
						testamentary dispositions. Let all that concerns the
						temple and the offerings set up be arranged in this
						manner. The estate at Stagira belonging to me I
						give and bequeath to Callinus. The whole of my
						library I give to Neleus. The garden and the walk
						and the houses adjoining the garden, all and sundry,
						I give and bequeath to such of my friends hereinafter named as may wish to study literature and
						philosophy there in common,

						<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
						since it is not possible
						for all men to be always in residence, on condition
						that no one alienates the property or devotes it to
						his private use, but so that they hold it like a temple
						in joint possession and live, as is right and proper,
						on terms of familiarity and friendship. Let the
						community consist of Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato,
						Callinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes,
						Melantes, Pancreon, Nicippus. Aristotle, the son
						of Metrodorus and Pythias, shall also have the right
						to study and associate with them if he so desire.
						And the oldest of them shall pay every attention to
						him, in order to ensure for him the utmost proficiency in philosophy. Let me be buried in any
						spot in the garden which seems most suitable,

					without unnecessary outlay upon my funeral or
						upon my monument.

						And according to previous
						agreement let the charge of attending, after my
						decease, to the temple and the monument and the
						garden and the walk be shared by Pompylus in
						person, living close by as he does, and exercising the
						same supervision over all other matters as before;
						and those who hold the property shall watch over
						his interests. Pompylus and Threpta have long been
						emancipated and have done me much service; and
						I think that 2000 drachmas certainly ought to belong
						to them from previous payments made to them by
						me, from their own earnings, and my present bequest
						to them to be paid by Hipparchus, as I stated many
						times in conversation with Melantes and Pancreon
						themselves, who agreed with me. I give and bequeath to them the maidservant Somatale. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
						And of
						my slaves I at once emancipate Molon and Timon
						and Parmeno; to Manes and Callias I give their
						freedom on condition that they stay four years in the
						garden and work there together and that their conduct is free from blame. Of my household furniture
						let so much as the executors think right be given to
						Pompylus and let the rest be sold. I also devise
						Carion to Demotimus, and Donax to Neleus. But
						Euboeus must be sold. Let Hipparchus pay to
						Callinus 3000 drachmas. And if I had not seen that
						Hipparchus had done great service to Melantes and
						Pancreon and formerly to me, and that now in his
						private affairs he has made shipwreck, I would have
						appointed him jointly with Melantes and Pancreon
						to carry out my wishes. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
						But, since I saw that it
					<pb n='509'/>
					was not easy for them to share the management
						with him, and I thought it more advantageous for
						them to receive a fixed sum from Hipparchus, let
						Hipparchus pay Melantes and Pancreon one talent
						each and let Hipparchus provide funds for the
						executors to defray the expenses set down in the
						will, as each disbursement falls due. And when
						Hipparchus shall have carried out all these injunctions, he shall be released in full from his liabilities
						to me. And any advance that he has made in
						Chalcis in my name belongs to him alone. Let
						Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus,
						Callisthenes and Ctesarchus be executors to carry out
						the terms of the will. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
						One copy of the will, sealed
						with the signet-ring of Theophrastus, is deposited
						with Hegesias, the son of Hipparchus, the witnesses
						being Callippus of Pallene, Philomelus of Euonymaea,
						Lysander of Hyba, and Philo of Alopece. Olympiodorus has another copy, the witnesses being the
						same. The third copy was received by Adeimantus,

					<p>There have been eight men who bore the name of

					<p>"In case anything should happen to me I make
						these dispositions. All the goods in my house I
						give and bequeath to Lampyrio and Arcesilaus.
						From the money belonging to me in Athens, in the
						first place my executors shall provide for my funeral
						and for all that custom requires to be done after the
						funeral, without extravagance on the one hand or
						meanness on the other. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
						The executors of this my
						will shall be Olympichus, Aristides, Mnesigenes,
						Hippocrates, Epicrates, Gorgylus, Diocles, Lyco,
						Athanes. I leave the school to Lyco, since of the
						rest some are too old and others too busy. But it
						would be well if the others would co-operate with him.
						I also give and bequeath to him all my books, except
						those of which I am the author, and all the furniture
						in the dining-hall, the cushions and the drinking-cups.
						The trustees shall give Epicrates 500 drachmas and
						one of the servants whom Arcesilaus shall approve.
						<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
						And in the first place Lampyrio and Arcesilaus shall
					<pb n='517'/>
					cancel the agreement which Da&iuml;ppus made on behalf
						of Iraeus. And he shall not owe anything either to
						Lampyrio or to Lampyrio's heirs, but shall have a
						full discharge from the whole transaction. Next,
						the executors shall give him 500 drachmas in money
						and one of the servants whom Arcesilaus shall
						approve, so that, in return for all the toil he has
						shared with me and all the services he has rendered
						me, he may have the means to maintain himself
						respectably. Further, I emancipate Diophantus,
						Diocles and Abus; and Simias I make over to
						Arcesilaus. I also emancipate Dromo. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
						As soon as
						Arcesilaus has arrived, Iraeus shall, with Olympichus,
						Epicrates, and the other executors, prepare an
						account of the money expended upon the funeral
						and the other customary charges. Whatever money
						remains over, Arcesilaus shall take over from
						Olympichus, without however pressing him as to
						times and seasons. Arcesilaus shall also cancel
						the agreement made by Strato with Olympichus
						and Ameinias and deposited with Philocrates the
						son of Tisamenus. With regard to my monument
						they shall make it as Arcesilaus, Olympichus and
						Lyco shall approve."</p>
					<p>Such are the terms of his extant will, according
						to the Collection of Ariston of Ceos. Strato himself,
						however, was, as stated above, a man entitled to
						full approbation,<note n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>pollh=s th=s a)podoxh=s
							a)/cios.</foreign> This phrase might be taken
							as Diogenes Laertius's defence for his inclusion of the Life of
							Strato. According to the scheme of i. 14, 15, the Peripatetics
							ended with Theophrastus, whose successors were often held
							to be vastly inferior, and unworthy to rank beside him; see
							Cicero,
							<hi rend='ital'>De Fin.</hi>v. &sect;&sect; 12, 13; Strabo xiii. 609. The latter
							alleges as the reason for this decline the well-known story
							that the school was deprived of Aristotle's library, which
							had been carried away to Scepsis.</note> since he excelled in every
						branch
						of learning, and most of all in that which is styled
					<pb n='519'/>
					"physics," a branch of philosophy more ancient and
						important than the others.</p>

					<head>Chapter 4. LYCO (299-225 B.C.)</head>
					<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
					<p>Strato's successor was Lyco, the son of Astyanax of
						Troas, a master of expression and of the foremost
						rank in the education of boys. For he used to say
						that modesty and love of honour were as necessary an
						equipment for boys as spur and bridle for horses.
						His eloquence and sonorousness of diction appear
						from the following fact; he speaks of a penniless
						maiden as follows: "A grievous burden to a father
						is a girl, when for lack of a dowry she runs past
						the flower of her age." Hence the remark which
						Antigonus is said to have made about him, that it
						was not possible to transfer elsewhere the fragrance
						and charm of the apple, but each separate expression
						must be contemplated in the speaker himself as
						every single apple is on the tree.
						<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
						This was because
						Lyco's voice was exceedingly sweet, so that some
						persons altered his name to Glyco, by prefixing a
						G. But in writing he fell off sadly. For instance,
						those who regretted their neglect to learn when they
						had the opportunity and wished they had done so
						he would hit off neatly as follows, remarking that
						"they were their own accusers, betraying, by vain
						regret, repentance for an incorrigible laziness."
						Those who deliberated wrongly he used to say
						were out in their calculations, as if they had used a
						crooked rule to test something straight, or looked
						at the reflection of a face in troubled water or a
						distorting mirror. Again, "Many go in search of
						the garland of the market-place; few or none seek
					<pb n='521'/>
					the crown at Olympia." He often gave the Athenians
						advice on various subjects and thus conferred on
						them the greatest benefits.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
					<p>In his dress he was most immaculate, so that the
						clothes he wore were unsurpassed for the softness
						of the material, according to Hermippus. Furthermore, he was well practised in gymnastics and kept
						himself in condition, displaying all an athlete's habit
						of body, with battered ears and skin begrimed with
						oil, so we are told by Antigonus of Carystus. Hence
						it is said that he not only wrestled but played the
						game of ball common in his birthplace of Ilium. He
						was esteemed beyond all other philosophers by
						Eumenes and Attalus, who also did him very great
						service. Antiochus too tried to get hold of him, but
						without success. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
						He was so hostile to Hieronymus
						the Peripatetic that he alone declined to meet him
						on the anniversary which we have mentioned in the
						Life of Arcesilaus.<note n='a'>iv. 41.</note></p>
					<p>He presided over the school forty-four years after
						Strato had bequeathed it to him by his will in the
						127th Olympiad.<note n='b'>274-270 b.c.</note> Not but what he also
						attended
						the lectures of the logician Panthoides. He died at
						the age of seventy-four after severe sufferings from
						gout. This is my epitaph upon him<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
							Pal.</hi> vii. 112.</note>:</p>
					<p>Nor, I swear! will I pass over Lyco either, for all that he
						died of the gout. But this it is which amazes me the most,
						if he who formerly could walk only with the feet of others,
						did in a single night traverse the long, long road to Hades.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
					<p>Other men have borne the name of Lyco: (1)
						a Pythagorean, (2) our present subject, (3) an epic
						poet, (4) a poet who wrote epigrams.</p>
					<pb n='523'/>
					<p>I have also come across this philosopher's will.
						It is this:</p>
					<p>"These are my dispositions concerning my
						property, in case I should be unable to sustain my
						present ailment. All the goods in my house I give
						to my brothers Astyanax and Lyco, and from this
						source should, I think, be paid all the money I have
						laid out at Athens, whether by borrowing or by
						purchase, as well as all the cost of my funeral and the
						other customary charges. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
						But my property in town
						and at Aegina I give to Lyco because he bears the
						same name with me, and has resided for a long time
						with me to my entire satisfaction, as became one
						whom I treated as my son. I leave the Peripatus
						to such of my friends as choose to make use of it,
						to Bulo, Callinus, Ariston, Amphion, Lyco, Pytho,
						Aristomachus, Heracleus, Lycomedes, and my nephew
						Lyco. They shall put over it any such person as
						in their opinion will persevere in the work of the
						school and will be most capable of extending it.
						And all my other friends should co-operate for love
						of me and of the spot. Bulo and Callinus, together
						with their colleagues, shall provide for my funeral
						and cremation, so as to avoid meanness on the
						one hand and extravagance on the other. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
						After
						my decease Lyco shall make over, for the use of the
						young men, the oil from the olive-trees belonging
						to me in Aegina for the due commemoration--so
						long as they use it--of myself and the benefactor
						who did me honour. He shall also set up my statue,
						and shall choose a convenient site where it shall
						be erected, with the assistance of Diophantus and
						Heraclides the son of Demetrius. From my property
						in town Lyco shall repay all from whom I have
					<pb n='525'/>
					borrowed anything after his departure. Bulo and
						Callinus shall provide the sums expended upon my
						funeral and other customary charges. These sums
						they shall recover from the moneys in the house
						bequeathed by me to them both in common. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
						They
						shall also remunerate the physicians Pasithemis and
						Medias who for their attention to me and their skill
						deserve far higher reward. I bequeath to the child
						of Callinus a pair of Thericlean cups, and to his wife
						a pair of Rhodian vessels, a smooth carpet, a rug with
						nap on both sides, a sofa cover and two cushions the
						best that are left, that, so far as I have the means
						of recompensing them, I may prove not ungrateful.
						With regard to the servants who have waited upon
						me, my wishes are as follows. To Demetrius I
						remit the purchase-money for the freedom which he
						has long enjoyed, and bequeath to him five minas
						and a suit of clothes to ensure him a decent maintenance, in return for all the toil he has borne with me.
						To Crito of Chalcedon I also remit the purchasemoney for his freedom and bequeath to him four
						minas. And Micrus I emancipate; and Lyco shall
						keep him and educate him for the next six years.
						<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
						And Chares I emancipate, and Lyco shall maintain
						him, and I bequeath him two minas and my published
						writings, while those which have not been given to
						the world I entrust to Callinus, that he may carefully
						edit them. To Syrus who has been set free I give
						four minas and Menodora, and I remit to him any
						debt he owes me. And to Hilara I give five minas
						and a double-napped rug, two cushions, a sofa-cover
						and a bed, whichever she prefers. I also set free the
						mother of Micrus as well as No&euml;mon, Dion, Theon,
						Euphranor and Hermias. Agathon should be set
					<pb n='527'/>
					free after two years, and the litter-bearers Ophelio
						and Posidonius after four years' further service.
						<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
						To Demetrius, to Crito and to Syrus I give a bed
						apiece and such bed-furniture out of my estate as
						Lyco shall think proper. These shall be given them
						for properly performing their appointed tasks. As
						regards my burial, let Lyco bury me here if he
						chooses, or if he prefers to bury me at home let him
						do so, for I am persuaded that his regard for propriety
						is not less than my own. When he has managed all
						these things, he can dispose of the property there,
						and such disposition shall be binding. Witnesses are
						Callinus of Hermione, Ariston of Ceos, Euphronius
						of Paeania."</p>
					<p>Thus while his shrewdness is seen in all his actions,
						in his teaching and in all his studies, in some ways
						his will is no less remarkable for carefulness and wise
						management, so that in this respect also he is to be
						admired</p>

					<p>Demetrius, the son of Phanostratus, was a native

						<hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name,</hi>
					<pb n='529'/>
					when Harpalus, fleeing from Alexander,<note n='a'>324 b.c.</note>
						came to

						the first book
						of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>; yet Lamia, with whom he lived,
						was a citizen of noble family, as Favorinus also
						states in his first book. Further, in his second book
						Favorinus alleges that he suffered violence from
						Cleon, while Didymus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Table-talk</hi> relates how
						a certain courtesan nicknamed him Charito-Blepharos
						("having the eyelids of the Graces"), and Lampito
						("of shining eyes"). He is said to have lost his sight
						when in Alexandria and to have recovered it by the
						gift of Sarapis; whereupon he composed the paeans
						which are sung to this day.</p>
					<p>For all his popularity with the Athenians he
						nevertheless suffered eclipse through all-devouring
						envy. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
						Having been indicted by some persons on a
						capital charge, he let judgement go by default; and,
						when his accusers could not get hold of his person,
						they disgorged their venom on the bronze of his
						statues. These they tore down from their pedestals;
						some were sold, some cast into the sea, and others were
						even, it is said, broken up to make bedroom-utensils.

					<p>And in the official list the year in which he was

					<p>Hermippus tells us that upon the death of Casander,
						being in fear of Antigonus, he fled to Ptolemy Soter.
						There he spent a considerable time and advised
						Ptolemy, among other things, to invest with sovereign power his children by Eurydice. To this
						Ptolemy would not agree, but bestowed the diadem
						on his son by Berenice, who, after Ptolemy's death,
						thought fit to detain Demetrius as a prisoner in the
						country until some decision should be taken concerning him. There he lived in great dejection, and
						somehow, in his sleep, received an asp-bite on the
						hand which proved fatal. He is buried in the district of Busiris near Diospolis.</p>

					<p>A venomous asp was the death of the wise Demetrius,
						an asp withal of sticky venom, darting, not light from its

					<p>Heraclides in his epitome of Sotion's
						<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
							Philosophers</hi> says that Ptolemy himself wished to transmit the kingdom to Philadelphus, but that Demetrius
						tried to dissuade him, saying, "If you give it to another, you will not have it yourself." At the time
						when he was being continually attacked in Athens,
						Menander, the Comic poet, as I have also learnt, was
						very nearly brought to trial for no other cause than
						that he was a friend of Demetrius. However, Telesphorus, the nephew of Demetrius, begged him off.</p>

						the Athenians had destroyed his statues, "That they
						may do," said he, "but the merits which caused
						them to be erected they cannot destroy." He used
						to say that the eyebrows formed but a small part
						of the face, and yet they can darken the whole of
						life by the scorn they express. Again, he said that
						not only was Plutus blind, but his guide, Fortune, as
						well; that all that steel could achieve in war was
						won in politics by eloquence. On seeing a young
						dandy, "There," quoth he, "is a four-square
						Hermes for you, with trailing robe, belly, beard and
					<pb n='537'/>
					all."<note n='a'>Since Herms at Athens show neither drapery nor

					<p>There have been twenty noteworthy men called

					<p>Again, he has a sort of intermediate style of conversation which he employs when philosophers,

						<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
						Furthermore, he wrote geometrical and dialectical
						works, and is, besides, everywhere versatile and lofty
						in diction, and a great adept at charming the reader's

					<pb n='545'/>
					<p>It seems that he delivered his native city from
						oppressions by assassinating its ruler, as is stated
						in his work on
						<hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi> by Demetrius
						of Magnesia, who also tells the following story about
						him: "As a boy, and when he grew up, he kept a
						pet snake, and, being at the point of death, he ordered
						a trusted attendant to conceal the corpse but to
						place the snake on his bier, that he might seem to
						have departed to the gods. 
						<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
						All this was done. But
						while the citizens were in the very midst of the
						procession and were loud in his praise, the snake,
						hearing the uproar, popped up out of the shroud,
						creating widespread confusion. Subsequently, however, all was revealed, and they saw Heraclides, not
						as he appeared, but as he really was."</p>
					<p>I have written of him as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
						Pal.</hi> vii. 104.</note>:</p>
					<p>You wished, Heraclides, to leave to all mankind a reputation that after death you lived as a snake.<note n='b'>Or, reading
						<foreign lang='greek'>a)/parti</foreign> for
						<foreign lang='greek'>a)/pasi</foreign>, "wished to leave a report
						behind you that immediately after death you became a
						living snake."</note> But you were
						deceived, you sophist, for the snake was really a brute beast,
						and you were detected as more of a beast than a sage.</p>
					<p>Hippobotus too has this tale.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
					<p>Hermippus relates that, when their territory was
						visited by famine, the people of Heraclea besought
						the Pythian priestess for relief, but Heraclides bribed
						the sacred envoys as well as the aforesaid priestess
						to reply that they would be rid of the calamity if
						Heraclides, the son of Euthyphro, were crowned with
						a crown of gold in his lifetime and after his death
						received heroic honours. The pretended oracle was
						brought home, but its forgers got nothing by it.
						For directly Heraclides was crowned in the theatre,
					<pb n='547'/>
					he was seized with apoplexy, whereupon the envoys
						to the oracle were stoned to death. Moreover, at
						the very same time the Pythian priestess, after she
						had gone down to the shrine and taken her seat,
						was bitten by one of the snakes and died instantly.
						Such are the tales told about his death.</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
					<p>Aristoxenus the musician asserts that Heraclides
						also composed tragedies, inscribing upon them the
						name of Thespis. Chamaeleon complains that
						Heraclides' treatise on the works of Homer and
						Hesiod was plagiarized from his own. Furthermore,
						Autodorus the Epicurean criticizes him in a polemic
						against his tract Of Justice. Again, Dionysius the
						Renegade, or, as some people call him, the "Spark,"
						when he wrote the Parthenopaeus, entitled it a play
						of Sophocles; and Heraclides, such was his credulity,
						in one of his own works drew upon this forged play
						as Sophoclean evidence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
						Dionysius, on perceiving
						this, confessed what he had done; and, when the
						other denied the fact and would not believe him,
						called his attention to the acrostic which gave the
						name of Pancalus, of whom Dionysius was very fond.
						Heraclides was still unconvinced. Such a thing, he
						said, might very well happen by chance. To this
						Dionysius, "You will also find these lines:</p>
					<p>a. An old monkey is not caught by a trap.<note n='a'>We should say,
						"An old bird is not caught with chaff."</note></p>
					<p>b. Oh yes, he's caught at last, but it takes time."</p>
					<p>And this besides: "Heraclides is ignorant of letters
						and not ashamed of his ignorance."<note n='b'>Von Arnim's emendation
							(<foreign lang='greek'>o( de\</foreign>) gives a different turn to

					ANTISTHENES (c. 446-366 B.C.)</head> 
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					<p>Antisthenes,<note n='a'><hi
						rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Clem. Alex. <hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i.
						66.</note> the son of Antisthenes, was an Athenian. It was said,
						however, that he was not of pure Attic blood. Hence his reply to one
						who taunted him with this: "The mother of the gods too is a
						Phrygian."<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi
							rend='ital'>De exilio</hi>, 607 a; Sen. <hi rend='ital'>De const.
								sap.</hi> c. 18, 5.</note> For his mother was supposed to have
						been a Thracian. Hence it was that, when he had distinguished
						himself in the battle of Tanagra,<note n='c'>Probably the battle in
							426 b.c. mentioned in Thuc. iii. 91.</note> he gave Socrates
						occasion to remark that, if both his parents had been Athenians, he
						would not have turned out so brave. He himself showed his contempt
						for the airs which the Athenians gave themselves on the strength of
						being sprung from the soil by the remark that this did not make them
						any better born than snails or wingless locusts.
					</p> 
					<p>To begin
						with, he became a pupil of Gorgias the rhetorician, and hence the
						rhetorical style that he introduces in his dialogues, and especially
						in his <hi rend='ital'>Truth</hi> and in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Exhortations.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
						
						According to Hermippus he intended
						at the public gathering for the Isthmian games to discourse on the
						faults and merits of Athenians, Thebans and Lacedaemonians,
					</p> <pb
						n='5'/> 
					<p>but begged to be excused when he saw throngs arriving
						from those cities.
					</p> 
					<p>Later on, however, he came into touch with
						Socrates, and derived so much benefit from him that he used to
						advise his own disciples to become fellow-pupils with him of
						Socrates. He lived in the Peiraeus, and every day would tramp the
						five miles to Athens in order to hear Socrates. From Socrates he
						learned his hardihood, emulating his disregard of feeling, and thus
						he inaugurated the Cynic way of life. He demonstrated that pain is a
						good thing by instancing the great Heracles and Cyrus, drawing the
						one example from the Greek world and the other from the
						barbarians.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<p>He was the first to define statement (or
						assertion) by saying that a statement is that which sets forth what
						a thing was or is. He used repeatedly to say, "I'd rather be mad
						than feel pleasure," and "We ought to make love to such women as
						will feel a proper gratitude." When a lad from Pontus was about to
						attend his lectures, and asked him what he required, the answer was,
						"Come with a new book, a new pen, and new tablets, if you have a
						mind to" (implying the need of brains as well).<note n='a'>There is
							the same untranslateable pun upon <foreign lang='greek'>
								kainou==</foreign> "new" and <foreign lang='greek'>kai\
									nou=</foreign>="a mind too," as in ii. &sect; 118.</note> When someone inquired what sort of wife he ought to marry, he said, "If she's
						beautiful, you'll not have her to yourself; if she's ugly, you'll
						pay for it dearly." Being told that Plato was abusing him, he
						remarked, "It is a royal privilege to do good and be ill spoken
						of."<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> M. Anton. vii. 36 <foreign lang='greek'> *)antisq eniko/n, basili ko\n me\n eu)- pra/ttei n, kakw=s de\

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<p>When he was being initiated into the
						Orphic mysteries, the priest said that those admitted into these
						rites would be partakers of many good things in Hades. "Why then,"
						said he, "don't you die ?"
					</p> <pb n='7'/> 
					<p>Being reproached
						because his parents were not both free-born, "Nor were they both
						wrestlers," quoth he, "but yet I am a wrestler." To the question why
						he had but few disciples he replied, "Because I use a silver rod to
						eject them." When he was asked why he was so bitter in reproving his
						pupils he replied, "Physicians are just the same with their
						patients." One day upon seeing an adulterer running for his life
						he exclaimed, "Poor wretch, what peril you might have escaped at the
						price of an obol." He used to say, as we learn from Hecato in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi>, that it is better to fall in with
						crows than with flatterers; for in the one case you are devoured
						when dead, in the other case while alive.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					<p>Being asked what
						was the height of human bliss, he replied, "To die happy." When a
						friend complained to him that he had lost his notes, "You should
						have inscribed them," said he, "on your mind instead of on paper."
						As iron is eaten away by rust, so, said he, the envious are consumed
						by their own passion. Those who would fain be immortal must, he
						declared, live piously and justly. States, said he, are doomed when
						they are unable to distinguish good men from bad. Once, when he was
						applauded by rascals, he remarked, "I am horribly afraid I have done
						something wrong."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="6"/>
					<p>When brothers agree, no fortress is so
						strong as their common life, he said. The right outfit for a voyage,
						he said, is such as, even if you are shipwrecked, will go through
						the water with you. One day when he was censured for keeping company
						with evil men, the reply he made was, "Well, physicians are in
						attendance on their patients without getting
					 <pb n='9'/> 
					the
						fever themselves." "It is strange," said he, "that we weed out the
						darnel from the corn and the unfit in war, but do not excuse evil
						men from the service of the state." When he was asked what advantage
						had accrued to him from philosophy, his answer was, "The ability to
						hold converse with myself." Some one having called upon him over
						the wine for a song, he replied, "Then you must accompany me on
						the pipe." When Diogenes begged a coat of him, he bade him fold his
						cloak around him double. 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="7"/>
						
						Being asked what learning is the most
						necessary, he replied, "How to get rid of having anything to
						unlearn." And he advised that when men are slandered, they should
						endure it more courageously than if they were pelted with
						stones.
					</p> 
					<p>And he used to taunt Plato with being conceited. At
						all events when in a procession he spied a spirited charger he said,
						turning to Plato, "It seems to me that you would have made just such
						a proud, showy steed." This because Plato was constantly praising
						horseflesh. And one day he visited Plato, who was ill, and seeing
						the basin into which Plato had vomited, remarked, "The bile I see,
						but not the pride." 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="8"/>
						
						He used to recommend the Athenians to vote that
						asses are horses.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi
							rend='ital'>Phaedrus</hi> 260 c.</note> When they deemed this
						absurd, his reply was, "But yet generals are found among you who had
						had no training, but were merely elected." "Many men praise you,"
						said one. "Why, what wrong have I done?" was his rejoinder. When he
						turned the torn part of his cloak so that it came into view,
						Socrates no sooner saw this than he said, "I spy your love of fame
						peeping through your cloak."<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
							Aelian, <hi rend='ital'>Var. Hist.</hi> ix. 35.</note> Phanias in
						his work on the Socratics tells us how some one asked him
					</p> <pb
						n='11'/> 
					<p>what he must do to be good and noble, and he replied,
						"You must learn from those who know that the faults you have are to
						be avoided." When some one extolled luxury his reply was, "May the
						sons of your enemies live in luxury."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="9"/>
					<p>To the youth who was
						posing fantastically as an artist's model he put this question,
						"Tell me, if the bronze could speak, on what, think you, would it
						pride itself most?" "On its beauty," was the reply. "Then," said he,
						"are you not ashamed of delighting in the very same quality as an
						inanimate object?" When a young man from Pontus promised to treat
						him with great consideration as soon as his boat with its freight of
						salt fish should arrive, he took him and an empty wallet to a
						flour-dealer's, got it filled, and was going away. When the woman
						asked for the money, "The young man will pay," said he, "when his
						boatload of salt fish arrives."
					</p> 
					<p>Antisthenes is held
						responsible for the exile of Anytus and the execution of Meletus.
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="10"/>
						For he fell in with some youths from Pontus whom the fame of
						Socrates had brought to Athens, and he led them off to Anytus, whom
						he ironically declared to be wiser than Socrates; whereupon (it is
						said) those about him with much indignation drove Anytus out of the
						city. If he saw a woman anywhere decked out with ornaments, he would
						hasten to her house and bid her husband bring out his horse and
						arms, and then, if the man possessed them, let his extravagance
						alone, for (he said) the man could with these defend himself; but,
						if he had none, he would bid him strip off the finery.
					</p>
					
					<p>Favourite themes<note n='a'>Here follow three extracts of Cynic
						maxims or rules of conduct; for, strictly speaking, they had no
						tenets proper ( <foreign lang='greek'>do/cai, do/gmat a</foreign>).
						The last ( &sect; 13) seems to be derived from Diocles.</note> with
						him were the following. He would prove that virtue can be taught;
						that
					 <pb n='13'/> 
					nobility belongs to none other than the
						virtuous. 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="11"/>
						
						And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure
						happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of a
						Socrates. And he maintained that virtue is an affair of deeds and
						does not need a store of words or learning; that the wise man is
						selfsufficing, for all the goods of others are his; that ill
						repute is a good thing and much the same as pain; that the wise man
						will be guided in his public acts not by the established laws but by
						the law of virtue; that he will also marry in order to have children
						from union with the handsomest women; furthermore that he will not
						disdain to love, for only the wise man knows who are worthy to be
						loved.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="12"/>
					<p>Diocles records the following sayings of his: To the
						wise man nothing is foreign or impracticable. A good man deserves
						to be loved. Men of worth are friends. Make allies of men who are at
						once brave and just. Virtue is a weapon that cannot be taken away.
						It is better to be with a handful of good men fighting against all
						the bad, than with hosts of bad men against a handful of good men.
						Pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover
						your mistakes. Esteem an honest man above a kinsman. Virtue is the
						same for women as for men. Good actions are fair and evil actions
						foul. Count all wickedness foreign and alien.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="13"/>
					<p>Wisdom is a
						most sure stronghold which never crumbles away nor is betrayed.
						Walls of defence must be constructed in our own impregnable reasonings. He used to converse in the gymnasium of Cynosarges (White
						hound) at no great distance from the gates, and some think that the
						Cynic school derived its name from Cynosarges. Antisthenes
					</p> <pb
						n='15'/> 
					<p>himself too was nicknamed a hound pure and simple. And
						he was the first, Diocles tells us, to double his cloak and be
						content with that one garment and to take up a staff and a wallet.
						Neanthes too asserts that he was the first to double his mantle.
						Sosicrates, however, in the third book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi> says this was first
						done by Diodorus of Aspendus, who also let his beard grow and used a
						staff and a wallet.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="14"/>
						
					<p>Of all the Socratics Antisthenes alone is
						praised by Theopompus, who says he had consummate skill and could by
						means of agreeable discourse win over whomsoever he pleased. And
						this is clear from his writings and from Xenophon's <hi
							rend='ital'>Banquet.</hi> It would seem that the most manly section
						of the Stoic School owed its origin to him. Hence Athenaeus the

					</p> 
					<p>Such was your

				<div2 n="2" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 2. DIOGENES (404-323
B.C.)</head> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="20"/>
					<p>Diogenes was a native of Sinope, son of Hicesius, a
						banker. Diocles relates that he went into exile because his father
						was entrusted with the money of the state and adulterated the
						coinage. But Eubulides in his book on Diogenes says that Diogenes
						himself did this and was forced to leave home along with his father.
						Moreover Diogenes himself actually confesses in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Pordalus</hi> that he adulterated the coinage. Some say
						that having been appointed to superintend the workmen he was
						persuaded by them, and that he went to Delphi or to the Delian
						oracle in his own city and inquired of Apollo whether he should do
						what he was urged to do. When the god gave him permission to alter
						the political currency, not understanding what this meant, he
						adulterated the state coinage, and when he was detected, according
						to some he was banished, while according to others he voluntarily
						quitted the city for fear of consequences. 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="21"/>
						
						One version is that his
						father entrusted him with the money and that he debased it, in
						consequence of which the father was imprisoned and died, while the
						son fled, came to Delphi, and inquired, not whether he should
						falsify the coinage, but what he should do to gain the greatest
						reputation ; and that then it was that he received the oracle.
					</p>
					<pb n='25'/> 
					<p>On reaching Athens he fell in with Antisthenes.
						Being repulsed by him, because he never welcomed pupils, by sheer
						persistence Diogenes wore him out. Once when he stretched out his
						staff against him, the pupil offered his head with the words,
						"Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from
						you, so long as I think you've something to say." From that time
						forward he was his pupil, and, exile as he was, set out upon a
						simple life.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="22"/>
					<p>Through watching a mouse running about, says
						Theophrastus in the Megarian dialogue, not looking for a place to
						lie down in, not afraid of the dark, not seeking any of the things
						which are considered to be dainties, he discovered the means of
						adapting himself to circumstances. He was the first, say some, to
						fold his cloak because he was obliged to sleep in it as well, and he
						carried a wallet to hold his victuals, and he used any place for any
						purpose, for breakfasting, sleeping, or conversing. And then he
						would say, pointing to the portico of Zeus and the Hall of
						Processions, that the Athenians had provided him with places to live
						in. 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="23"/>
						
						He did not lean upon a staff until he grew infirm ; but
						afterwards he would carry it everywhere, not indeed in the city, but
						when walking along the road with it and with his wallet ; so say
						Olympiodorus,<note n='a'>An eminent politician. Pausanias, i. cc.

						Aeschrio. He had written to some one to try and procure a cottage
						for him. When this man was a long time about it, he took for his
						abode the tub in the Metro&ouml;n, as he himself explains in his letters.
						And in summer he used to roll in it over hot sand,
					 <pb n='27'/>
					
					while in winter he used to embrace statues covered with snow,
						using every means of inuring himself to hardship.

						<milestone unit ="section" n="24"/>
						
						He was
						great at pouring scorn on his contemporaries. The school of
						Euclides he called bilious, and Plato's lectures waste of time, the
						performances at the Dionysia great peep-shows for fools, and the
						demagogues the mob's lacqueys. He used also to say that when he saw
						physicians, philosophers and pilots at their work, he deemed man the
						most intelligent of all animals ; but when again he saw interpreters
						of dreams and diviners and those who attended to them, or those who
						were puffed up with conceit of wealth, he thought no animal more
						silly. He would continually say<note n='a'>Some of the stories which
							follow are so much alike that it is charitable to suppose that
							Laertius drew from more than one collection of the sayings of
							Diogenes.</note> that for the conduct of life we need right reason
						or a halter.

						for the sake of these dishes, now when they are before you do not
						enjoy them ?" "Nay, by the gods, Diogenes," replied Plato, "there
						also for the most part I lived upon olives and such like." "Why
						then," said Diogenes, "did you need to go to Syracuse ? Was it that
						Attica at that time did not grow olives ?" But Favorinus in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> attributes this to
						Aristippus. Again, another time he was eating dried figs when he
						encountered Plato and offered him a share of them. When Plato took
						them and ate them, he said, "I said you might share them, not that
						you might eat them all up."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="26"/>
					<p>And one day when Plato had
						invited to his house
					 <pb n='29'/> 
					friends coming from
						Dionysius, Diogenes trampled upon his carpets and said, "I trample
						upon Plato's vainglory." Plato's reply was, "How much pride you
						expose to view, Diogenes, by seeming not to be proud." Others tell
						us that what Diogenes said was, "I trample upon the pride of Plato,"
						who retorted, "Yes, Diogenes, with pride of another sort."

						makes the Cynic address this remark to Plato himself. Diogenes once
						asked him for wine, and after that also for some dried figs ; and
						Plato sent him a whole jar full. Then the other said, "If some one
						asks you how many two and two are, will you answer, Twenty ? So, it
						seems, you neither give as you are asked nor answer as you are
						questioned." Thus he scoffed at him as one who talked without
						end.

					<milestone unit ="section" n="27"/>
					<p>Being asked where in Greece he saw good men, he replied,
						"Good men nowhere, but good boys at Lacedaemon." When one day he was
						gravely discoursing and nobody attended to him, he began
						whistling, and as people clustered about him, he reproached them
						with coming in all seriousness to hear nonsense, but slowly and
						contemptuously when the theme was serious. He would say that men
						strive in digging<note n='b'>From Epictetus iii. 15. 4 it is evident
							that competition in digging trenches (<foreign lang='greek'>e)n tw=|
								a)gw=ni paroru/s sesqai</foreign> ) formed a part of the course of
							preparation which athletes underwent at Olympia.</note> and kicking
						to outdo one another, but no one strives to become a good man and
						true. And he would wonder that the grammarians should investigate
						the ills of Odysseus, while they were ignorant of their own. Or that
						the musicians should tune the strings of the lyre, while leaving the
						dispositions of their own souls discordant ;
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="28"/>
						
						that the mathematicians
						should gaze at the sun
					 <pb n='31'/> 
					and the moon, but
						overlook matters close at hand; that the orators should make a fuss
						about justice in their speeches, but never practise it ; or that the
						avaricious should cry out against money, while inordinately fond of
						it. He used also to condemn those who praised honest men for being
						superior to money, while themselves envying the very rich. He was
						moved to anger that men should sacrifice to the gods to ensure
						health and in the midst of the sacrifice should feast to the
						detriment of health. He was astonished that when slaves saw their
						masters were gluttons, they did not steal some of the viands. 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="29"/>
						
						He
						would praise those who were about to marry and refrained, those who
						intending to go a voyage never set sail, those who thinking to
						engage in politics do no such thing, those also who purposing to
						rear a family do not do so, and those who make ready to live with
						potentates, yet never come near them after all. He used to say,
						moreover, that we ought to stretch out our hands to our friends with
						the fingers open and not closed.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>

								H&uuml;bner, on the authority of Ambrosius, reads "Hermippus"; for among
								the works of Menippus enumerated by Laertius below (&sect; 101) there is no
								mention of a "Sale of Diogenes."</note> in his <hi rend='ital'>Sale
									of Diogenes</hi> tells how, when he was captured and put up for
						sale, he was asked what he could do. He replied, "Govern men." And
						he told the crier to give notice in case anybody wanted to purchase
						a master for himself. Having been forbidden to sit down, "It makes
						no difference," said he, "for in whatever position fishes lie, they
						still find purchasers." 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="30"/>
						
						And he said he marvelled that before we buy
						a jar or dish we try whether it rings true, but if it is a man are
						content merely to look
					 <pb n='33'/> 
					at him. To Xeniades who
						purchased him he said, "You must obey me, although I am a slave ;
						for, if a physician or a steersman were in slavery, he would be
						obeyed." Eubulus in his book entitled <hi rend='ital'>The Sale of
							Diogenes</hi> tells us that this was how he trained the sons of
						Xeniades. After their other studies he taught them to ride, to shoot
						with the bow, to sling stones and to hurl javelins. Later, when they
						reached the wrestling-school, he would not permit the master to give
						them full athletic training, but only so much as to heighten their
						colour and keep them in good condition.

						<milestone unit ="section" n="31"/>
						
						The boys used to get
						by heart many passages from poets, historians, and the writings of
						Diogenes himself ; and he would practise them in every short cut to
						a good memory. In the house too he taught them to wait upon
						themselves, and to be content with plain fare and water to drink. He
						used to make them crop their hair close and to wear it unadorned,
						and to go lightly clad, barefoot, silent, and not looking about them
						in the streets. He would also take them out hunting. They on their
						part had a great regard for Diogenes and made requests of their
						parents for him. The same Eubulus relates that he grew old in the
						house of Xeniades, and when he died was buried by his sons. There
						Xeniades once asked him how he wished to be buried. To which he
						replied, "On my face." 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="32"/>
						
						"Why ?" inquired the other. "Because," said
						he, "after a little time down will be converted into up." This
						because the Macedonians had now got the supremacy, that is, had
						risen high from a humble position. Some one took him into a
						magnificent house and warned him not to expectorate, whereupon
						having cleared his throat
					 <pb n='35'/> 
					he discharged the
						phlegm into the man's face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner
						receptacle. Others father this upon Aristippus. One day he shouted
						out for men, and when people collected, hit out at them with his
						stick, saying, "It was men I called for, not scoundrels." This is
						told by Hecato in the first book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Anecdotes.</hi> Alexander is reported to have said, "Had
						I not been Alexander, I should have liked to be Diogenes."
					</p>
					<milestone unit ="section" n="33"/>
					<p>The word "disabled" (<foreign lang='greek'> a)naph/ro
						us</foreign>), Diogenes held, ought to be applied not to the deaf or
						blind, but to those who have no wallet (<foreign lang='greek'>ph/ra</foreign>). One day he made his way with head half
						shaven into a party of young revellers, as Metrocles relates in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Anecdotes,</hi> and was roughly handled by them.
						Afterwards he entered on a tablet the names of those who had struck
						him and went about with the tablet hung round his neck, till he had
						covered them with ridicule and brought universal blame and discredit
						upon them. He described himself as a hound of the sort which all men
						praise, but no one, he added, of his admirers dared go out hunting
						along with him. When some one boasted that at the Pythian games he
						had vanquished men, Diogenes replied, "Nay, I defeat men, you defeat
						slaves."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit ="section" n="34"/>
					<p>To those who said to him, "You are an old man ; take
						a rest," "What ?" he replied, "if I were running in the stadium,
						ought I to slacken my pace when approaching the goal ? ought I not
						rather to put on speed ?" Having been invited to a dinner, he
						declared that he wouldn't go ; for, the last time he went, his host
						had not expressed a proper gratitude. He would walk upon snow
						barefoot and do the other things mentioned above. Not only so ;
						he
					 <pb n='37'/> 
					even attempted to eat meat raw, but could not
						manage to digest it. He once found Demosthenes the orator lunching
						at an inn, and, when he retired within, Diogenes said, "All the more
						you will be inside the tavern." When some strangers expressed a wish
						to see Demosthenes, he stretched out his middle finger and said,
						"There goes the demagogue of Athens." 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="35"/>
						
						Some one dropped a loaf of
						bread and was ashamed to pick it up ; whereupon Diogenes, wishing to
						read him a lesson, tied a rope to the neck of a wine-jar and
						proceeded to drag it across the Ceramicus.
					</p> 
					<p>He used to say
						that he followed the example of the trainers of choruses ; for they
						too set the note a little high, to ensure that the rest should hit
						the right note. Most people, he would say, are so nearly mad that a
						finger makes all the difference. For, if you go along with your
						middle finger stretched out, some one will think you mad, but, if
						it's the little finger, he will not think so. Very valuable things,
						said he, were bartered for things of no value, and <hi
							rend='ital'>vice versa.</hi> At all events a statue fetches three
						thousand drachmas, while a quart of barley-flour is sold for two
						copper coins.

					<milestone unit ="section" n="36"/>
					<p>To Xeniades, who purchased him, he said, "Come,
						see that you obey orders." When he quoted the line,

					<p><hi
						rend='center'>Backward the streams flow to their founts,<note

					</p>
					
					<p>Diogenes asked, "If you had been ill and had purchased a doctor,
						would you then, instead of obeying him, have said "`Backward the
						streams flow to their founts'" ? Some one wanted to study philosophy
						under him. Diogenes gave him a tunny to carry and told him to follow
						him. And when for shame the man threw it away and departed,
					</p> <pb
						n='39'/> 
					<p>some time after on meeting him he laughed and said, "The
						friendship between you and me was broken by a tunny." The version
						given by Diocles, however, is as follows. Some one having said to
						him, "Lay your commands upon us, Diogenes," he took him away and
						gave him a cheese to carry, which cost half an obol. The other
						declined ; whereupon he remarked, "The friendship between you and
						me is broken by a little cheese worth half an obol."

					<milestone unit ="section" n="37"/>
					<p>One day,
						observing a child drinking out of his hands, he cast away the cup
						from his wallet with the words, "A child has beaten me in plainness
						of living." He also threw away his bowl when in like manner he saw a
						child who had broken his plate taking up his lentils with the hollow
						part of a morsel of bread. He used also to reason thus: "All things
						belong to the gods. The wise are friends of the gods, and friends
						hold things in common. Therefore all things belong to the wise." One
						day he saw a woman kneeling before the gods in an ungraceful
						attitude, and wishing to free her of superstition, according to
						Zo&iuml;lus of Perga, he came forward and said, "Are you not afraid, my
						good woman, that a god may be standing behind you ?--for all things
						are full of his presence--and you may be put to shame ?" 
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="38"/>
						
						He
						dedicated to Asclepius a bruiser who, whenever people fell on their
						faces, used to run up to them and bruise them.
					</p> 
					<p>All the curses
						of tragedy, he used to say, had lighted upon him. At all events he
						was

					<p>But he claimed that to fortune he
						could oppose
					 <pb n='41'/> 
					courage, to convention nature, to

						Alexander came and stood over him and said, "Ask of me any boon you

						Some one had been reading aloud for a very long time, and when he
						was near the end of the roll pointed to a space with no writing on
						it. "Cheer up, my men," cried Diogenes ; "there's land in sight." To
						one who by argument had proved conclusively that he had horns, he
						said, touching his forehead, "Well, I for my part don't see any."
						
						<milestone unit ="section" n="39"/>
						
						In
						like manner, when somebody declared that there is no such thing as
						motion, he got up and walked about. When some one was discoursing on
						celestial phenomena, "How many days," asked Diogenes, "were you in
						coming from the sky ?" A eunuch of bad character had inscribed on
						his door the words, "Let nothing evil enter." "How then," he asked,
						"is the master of the house to get in ?" When he had anointed his
						feet with unguent, he declared that from his head the unguent passed
						into the air, but from his feet into his nostrils. The Athenians
						urged him to become initiated, and told him that in the other world
						those who have been initiated enjoy a special privilege. "It would
						be ludicrous," quoth he, "if Agesilaus and Epaminondas are to dwell
						in the mire, while certain folk of no account will live in the Isles
						of the Blest because they have been initiated."

					baths, somebody
						inquired if many men were bathing. He said, No. But to another who
						asked if there was a great crowd of bathers, he said, Yes. Plato had
						defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded.
						Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with
						the words, "Here is Plato's man." In consequence of which there was
						added to the definition, "having broad nails." To one who asked what

							Herod's pig than his son."</note> To one who had brandished a beam
						at him and then cried, "Look out," he replied, "What, are you
						intending to strike me again?" He used to call the demagogues the
						lackeys of the people and the crowns awarded to them the
						efflorescence of fame. He lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as
						he went about, "I am looking for a man." One day he got a thorough
						drenching where he stood, and, when the bystanders pitied him, Plato
						said, if they really pitied him, they should move away, alluding to
						his vanity. When some one hit him a blow with his fist, "Heracles,"
						said he, "how came I to forget to put on a helmet when I walked

						Further, when Meidias assaulted him and went on to say, "There
						are 3000 drachmas to your credit," the next day he took a pair of

					<p>When
						Lysias the druggist asked him if he believed in the gods, "How can I
						help believing in them," said he, "when I see a god-forsaken wretch
						like you?" Others give this retort to Theodorus. Seeing some one
						perform religious purification, he said, "Unhappy man, don't you
						know that you can no more get rid of errors of conduct by
						sprinklings than you can of mistakes in grammar?" He would rebuke
						men in general with regard to their prayers, declaring that they
						asked for those things which seemed to them to be good, not for such

						As for those who were excited over their dreams
						he would say that they cared nothing for what they did in their
						waking hours, but kept their curiosity for the visions called up in
						their sleep. At Olympia, when the herald proclaimed Dioxippus to be
						victor over the men, Diogenes protested, "Nay, he is victorious over
						slaves, I over men."
					</p> 
					<p>Still he was loved by the Athenians. At
						all events, when a youngster broke up his tub, they gave the boy a
						flogging and presented Diogenes with another. Dionysius the Stoic
						says that after Chaeronea he was seized and dragged off to Philip,
						and being asked who he was, replied, "A spy upon your insatiable

					<p>Perdiccas having threatened to put him to death unless he came to
						him, "That's nothing wonderful," quoth he, "for a beetle or a
						tarantula would
					 <pb n='47'/> 
					do the same." Instead of that he
						would have expected the threat to be that Perdiccas would be quite
						happy to do without his company. He would often insist loudly that
						the gods had given to men the means of living easily, but this had
						been put out of sight, because we require honeyed cakes, unguents
						and the like. Hence to a man whose shoes were being put on by his
						servant, he said, "You have not attained to full felicity, unless he
						wipes your nose as well; and that will come, when you have lost the
						use of your hands."

						"Well done," he said, "you will hit your mark."<note n='a'><hi

						When some boys clustered round him and said, "Take care he doesn't
						bite us," he answered, "Never fear, boys, a dog does not eat
						beetroot." To one who was proud of wearing a lion's skin his words
						were, "Leave off dishonouring the habiliments of courage." When
						some one was extolling the good fortune of Callisthenes and saying
						what splendour he shared in the suite of Alexander, "Not so," said

						him to his friends and bade them keep
					 <pb n='49'/> 
					strict
						watch over him. When a youth effeminately attired put a question to
						him, he declined to answer unless he pulled up his robe and showed
						whether he was man or woman. A youth was playing cottabos in the
						baths. Diogenes said to him, "The better you play, the worse it is
						for you." At a feast certain people kept throwing all the bones to
						him as they would have done to a dog.<note n='a'>"You would not see

					<p>Rhetoricians and all

						profligate, "To be sold," he said, "I knew well that after such
						surfeiting you would throw up the owner." To a young man who
						complained of the number of people who annoyed him by their
						attentions he said, "Cease to hang out a sign of invitation." Of a
						public bath which was dirty he said, "When people have bathed here,
						where are they to go to get clean?" There was a stout musician whom
						everybody depreciated and Diogenes alone praised. When asked why, he
						said, "Because being so big, he yet sings to his lute and does not
						turn brigand."

					<milestone unit ="section" n="48"/>
					<p>The musician who was always deserted by his
						audience he greeted with a "Hail chanticleer," and when asked why he
						so addressed him, replied, "Because your song makes every one get
						up." A young man was delivering a set speech, when Diogenes, having
						filled the front fold of his dress with lupins, began to eat them,
						standing right opposite to him. Having thus drawn off the
						attention of the assemblage, he said he was greatly surprised
					
					<pb n='51'/> 
					that they should desert the orator to look at
						himself. A very superstitious person addressed him thus, "With one
						blow I will break your head." "And I," said Diogenes, "by a sneeze
						from the left will make you tremble." Hegesias having asked him to
						lend him one of his writings, he said, "You are a simpleton,
						Hegesias; you do not choose painted figs, but real ones; and yet you
						pass over the true training and would apply yourself to written
						rules."

					<p>When some one reproached him with his exile, his

						the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, "And I them," said
						he, "to home-staying." Once he saw an Olympic victor tending sheep
						and thus accosted him: "Too quickly, my good friend, have you left
						Olympia for Nemea.<note n='a'>Shepherd's Bush.</note>" Being asked
						why athletes are so stupid, his answer was, "Because they are built
						up of pork and beef." He once begged alms of a statue, and, when
						asked why he did so, replied, "To get practice in being refused." In
						asking alms --as he did at first by reason of his poverty-- he used
						this form: "If you have already given to anyone else, give to me
						also; if not, begin with me."

					<p>On being asked by a tyrant what

						hangs them up, and, when they are empty, he throws them away." Some

					<p>The son of Zeus, victorious Heracles,
					</p> 
					<p>Dwells here; let

					<p>The question being asked why footmen are so called,

						for a mina. "Because," said Diogenes, "I expect to receive from

					<p>Seeing a bad archer, he sat down beside the

					<p>Being
						asked whether death was an evil thing, he replied, "How can it be
						evil, when in its presence we are not aware of it ?" When Alexander
						stood opposite him and asked, "Are you not afraid of me ?" "Why,
						what are you ?" said he, "a good thing or a bad ?" Upon Alexander
						replying "A good thing," "Who then," said Diogenes, "is afraid of
						the good ?" Education, according to him, is a controlling grace to
						the young, consolation to the
					 <pb n='71'/> 
					old, wealth to the
						poor, and ornament to the rich. When Didymon, who was a rake, was
						once treating a girl's eye, "Beware," says Diogenes, "lest the
						oculist instead of curing the eye should ruin the pupil." On
						somebody declaring that his own friends were plotting against him,
						Diogenes exclaimed, "What is to be done then, if you have to treat

					<p>Being asked what was the most

						entering a boys' school, he found there many statues of the Muses,
						but few pupils. "By the help of the gods," said he, "schoolmaster,
						you have plenty of pupils." It was his habit to do everything in
						public, the works of Demeter and of Aphrodite alike. He used to draw
						out the following arguments. "If to breakfast be not absurd, neither
						is it absurd in the market-place ; but to breakfast is not absurd,
						therefore it is not absurd to breakfast in the marketplace."
						Behaving indecently in public, he wished "it were as easy to banish
						hunger by rubbing the belly." Many other sayings are attributed to
						him, which it would take long to enumerate.<note n='a'>&sect;&sect; 70-73. As &sect; 74

					<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
					<p>He used to affirm that
						training was of two kinds, mental and bodily : the latter being that
						whereby, with constant exercise, perceptions are formed such as
						secure freedom of movement for virtuous deeds ; and the one half of
						this training is incomplete without the other, good health and
						strength being just as much included among the essential things,
						whether for body or soul. And he would adduce indisputable evidence
						to show how easily from
					 <pb n='73'/> 
					gymnastic training we
						arrive at virtue. For in the manual crafts and other arts it can be
						seen that the craftsmen develop extraordinary manual skill through
						practice. Again, take the case of flute-players and of athletes :
						what surpassing skill they acquire by their own incessant toil ;
						and, if they had transferred their efforts to the training of the
						mind, how certainly their labours would not have been unprofitable
						or ineffective.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
					<p>Nothing in life, however, he maintained, has
						any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice ; and this is
						capable of overcoming anything. Accordingly, instead of useless
						toils men should choose such as nature recommends, whereby they
						might have lived happily. Yet such is their madness that they choose
						to be miserable. For even the despising of pleasure is itself most
						pleasurable, when we are habituated to it ; and just as those
						accustomed to a life of pleasure feel disgust when they pass over to
						the opposite experience, so those whose training has been of the
						opposite kind derive more pleasure from despising pleasure than from
						the pleasures themselves. This was the gist of his conversation ;
						and it was plain that he acted accordingly, adulterating currency in
						very truth, allowing convention no such authority as he allowed to
						natural right, and asserting that the manner of life he lived was
						the same as that of Heracles when he preferred liberty to
						everything.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
					<p>He maintained that all things are the property of
						the wise, and employed such arguments as those cited above. All
						things belong to the gods. The gods are friends to the wise, and
						friends share all property in common ; therefore all things are the
						property of the wise. Again as to law : that it is
					 <pb n='75'/>
					
					impossible for society to exist without law ; for without a city
						no benefit can be derived from that which is civilized. But the city
						is civilized, and there is no advantage in law without a city ;
						therefore law is something civilized. He would ridicule good birth
						and fame and all such distinctions, calling them showy ornaments of
						vice. The only true commonwealth was, he said, that which is as wide
						as the universe. He advocated community of wives, recognizing no
						other marriage than a union of the man who persuades with the woman
						who consents. And for this reason he thought sons too should be held
						in common.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
					<p>And he saw no impropriety either in stealing anything from a temple or in eating the flesh of any animal ; nor even
						anything impious in touching human flesh, this, he said, being clear
						from the custom of some foreign nations. Moreover, according to
						right reason, as he put it, all elements are contained in all things
						and pervade everything : since not only is meat a constituent of
						bread, but bread of vegetables ; and all other bodies also, by means
						of certain invisible passages and particles, find their way in and
						unite with all substances in the form of vapour. This he makes plain
						in the <hi rend='ital'>Thyestes</hi>, if the tragedies are really
						his and not the work of his friend Philiscus of Aegina or of
						Pasiphon, the son of Lucian,<note n='a'>It has been conjectured that
							the Pasiphon meant was the philosopher of Eretria, to whom Persaeus
							attributed the composition of spurious Socratic Dialogues (<hi
								rend='ital'>v. supra</hi>, ii. 61). Modern scholars incline to
							regard him as the author of the <foreign lang='greek'>*pi/nac</foreign> attributed to Cebes by D. L. ii. 125 (v. Susemihl, <hi

					<p>He became very ready also at repartee in verbal debates, as is
						evident from what has been said above.
					</p> 
					<p>Further, when he was
						sold as a slave, he endured it most nobly. For on a voyage to Aegina
						he was captured by pirates under the command of Scirpalus,<note
							n='a'>"Harpalus" according to Cic. <hi rend='ital'>N.D.</hi> iii.
							34. 83.</note> conveyed to Crete and exposed for sale. When the
						auctioneer asked in what he was proficient, he replied, "In ruling
						men." Thereupon he pointed to a certain Corinthian with a fine
						purple border to his robe, the man named Xeniades above-mentioned,
						and said, "Sell me to this man ; he needs a master." Thus Xeniades
						came to buy him, and took him to Corinth and set him over his own
						children and entrusted his whole household to him. And he
						administered it in all respects in such a manner that Xeniades used
						to go about saying, "A good genius has entered my house."
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
					<p>Cleomenes in his work entitled <hi rend='ital'>Concerning Pedagogues</hi> says that the friends of Diogenes wanted to ransom him,
						whereupon he called them simpletons ; for, said he, lions are not
						the slaves of those who feed them, but rather those who feed them
						are at the mercy of the lions : for fear is the mark of the slave,
						whereas wild beasts make men afraid of them. The man had in fact a
						wonderful gift of persuasion, so that he could easily vanquish
						anyone he liked in argument. At all events a certain Onesicritus of
						Aegina is said to have sent to Athens the one of his two sons named
						Androsthenes, and he having become a pupil of Diogenes stayed there
						; the father then sent the other also, the aforesaid Philiscus, who
						was the elder, in search of him ; but Philiscus also was detained in
						the same way. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
						
						When, thirdly, the father himself arrived, he was just
						as much attracted to the
					 <pb n='79'/> 
					pursuit of philosophy
						as his sons and joined the circle--so magical was the spell which
						the discourses of Diogenes exerted. Amongst his hearers was Phocion
						surnamed the Honest, and Stilpo the Megarian, and many other men
						prominent in political life.
					</p> 
					<p>Diogenes is said to have been
						nearly ninety years old when he died. Regarding his death there are
						several different accounts. One is that he was seized with colic
						after eating an octopus raw and so met his end. Another is that he
						died voluntarily by holding his breath. This account was followed by
						Cercidas of Megalopolis (or of Crete), who in his meliambics writes
						thus :
					</p> 
					<p>Not so he who aforetime was a citizen of Sinope,
					</p>
					
					<p>That famous one who carried a staff, doubled his cloak, and lived
						in the open air.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
					<p>But he soared aloft with his lip tightly
						pressed against his teeth
					</p> 
					<p>And holding his breath withal. For
						in truth he was rightly named
					</p> 
					<p>Diogenes, a true-born son of
						Zeus, a hound of heaven.
					</p> 
					<p>Another version is that, while
						trying to divide an octopus amongst the dogs, he was so severely
						bitten on the sinew of the foot that it caused his death. His
						friends, however, according to Antisthenes in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>, conjectured that it
						was due to the retention of his breath. For he happened to be living
						in the Craneum, the gymnasium in front of Corinth. When his friends
						came according to custom and found him wrapped up in his cloak, they
						thought that he must be asleep, although he was by no means of a
						drowsy or somnolent habit. They therefore drew aside his cloak and
						found that
					 <pb n='81'/> 
					he was dead. This they supposed to
						have been his deliberate act in order to escape thenceforward from
						life.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
					<p>Hence, it is said, arose a quarrel among his disciples as to who should bury him : nay, they even came to blows ;
						but, when their fathers and men of influence arrived, under their
						direction he was buried beside the gate leading to the Isthmus. Over
						his grave they set up a pillar and a dog in Parian marble upon it.
						Subsequently his fellow-citizens honoured him with bronze statues,
						on which these verses were inscribed :
					</p> 
					<p>Time makes even bronze
						grow old : but thy glory, Diogenes, all eternity will never destroy.
						Since thou alone didst point out to mortals the lesson of

					<p>We too have

					</p> 
					<p>But some say that when dying he left instructions
						that they should throw him out unburied, that every wild beast might
						feed on him, or thrust him into a ditch and sprinkle a little dust
						over him. But according to others his instructions were that they
						should throw him into the Ilissus, in order that he might be useful
						to his brethren.
					</p> 
					<p>Demetrius in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Men

					<p>Monimus of Syracuse was a pupil of Diogenes
						; and, according to Sosicrates, he was in the service of a certain
						Corinthian banker, to whom Xeniades, the purchaser of Diogenes, made
						frequent visits, and by the account which he gave of his goodness in
						word and deed, excited in Monimus a passionate admiration of
						Diogenes. For he forthwith pretended to be mad and proceeded to
						fling away the small change and all the money on the banker's table,
						until at length his master dismissed him ; and he then straightway
						devoted himself to Diogenes. He often followed Crates the Cynic as
						well, and embraced the like pursuits ; whereupon his master, seeing
						him do this, was all the more persuaded that he was mad.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
					<p>He

					<p>Onesicritus some report to have been an Aeginetan, but Demetrius

					<p>He flourished in the 113th Olympiad.<note

					</p> 
					<p>According to Antisthenes in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Successions</hi>, the first impulse to the Cynic
						philosophy was given to him when he saw Telephus in a certain
						tragedy carrying a little basket and altogether in a wretched
						plight. So he turned his property into money,--for he belonged to a
						distinguished family,--and having thus collected about 200 talents,
						distributed that sum among his fellow-citizens. And (it is added) so
						sturdy a philosopher did he become that he is mentioned by the
						comic poet Philemon. At all events the latter says :
					</p> 
					<p>In
						summer-time a thick cloak he would wear
					</p> 
					<p>To be like Crates,
						and in winter rags.
					</p> 
					<p>Diocles relates how Diogenes persuaded
						Crates to give up his fields to sheep pasture, and throw into the
						sea any money he had.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
					<p>In the home of Crates Alexander is said
						to have lodged, as Philip once lived in Hipparchia's. Often, too,
						certain of his kinsmen would come to visit him and try to divert him
						from his purpose. These he would drive from him with his stick, and
						his resolution was unshaken. Demetrius of Magnesia tells a story
						that he entrusted a banker with a sum of money on condition that, if
						his sons proved ordinary men he was to pay it to them, but, if they
						became
					 <pb n='93'/> 
					philosophers, then to distribute it among
						the people : for his sons would need nothing, if they took to
						philosophy. Eratosthenes tells us that by Hipparchia, of whom we
						shall presently speak, he had a son born to him named Pasicles, and
						after he had ceased to be a cadet on service, Crates took him to a
						brothel and told him that was how his father had married. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
						
						The
						marriage of intrigue and adultery, he said, belonged to tragedy,
						having exile or assassination as its rewards ; while the weddings
						of those who take up with courtesans are material for comedy, for as
						a result of extravagance and drunkenness they bring about
						madness.
					</p> 
					<p>This man had a brother named Pasicles, who was a
						disciple of Euclides.
					</p> 
					<p>Favorinus, in the second book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, tells a pleasant story of Crates.
						For he relates how, when making some request of the master of the
						gymnasium, he laid hold on his hips ; and when he demurred, said,
						"What, are not these hip-joints yours as much as your knees ?" It
						was, he used to say, impossible to find anybody wholly free from
						flaws ; but, just as in a pomegranate, one of the seeds is always
						going bad. Having exasperated the musician Nicodromus, he was
						struck by him on the face. So he stuck a plaster on his forehead
						with these words on it, "Nicodromus's handiwork." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
						
						He carried on a
						regular campaign of invective against the courtesans, habituating
						himself to meet their abuse.
					</p> 
					<p>When Demetrius of Phalerum sent
						him loaves of bread and some wine, he reproached him, saying, "Oh
						that the springs yielded bread as well as water!" It is clear, then,
						that he was a water-drinker. When
					 <pb n='95'/> 
					the
						police-inspectors found fault with him for wearing muslin, his
						answer was, "I'll show you that Theophrastus also wears muslin."
						This they would not believe : so he led them to a barber's shop and
						showed them Theophrastus being shaved. At Thebes he was flogged by
						the master of the gymnasium--another version being that it was by
						Euthycrates and at Corinth ; and being dragged by the heels, he
						called out, as if it did not affect him<note n='a'>Hom. <hi

					</p> 
					<p>Seized by the foot and

					<p>Diocles, however, says
						that it was by Menedemus of Eretria that he was thus dragged. For he
						being handsome and being thought to be intimate with Asclepiades the
						Phliasian, Crates slapped him on the side with a brutal taunt;
						whereupon Menedemus, full of indignation, dragged him along, and he
						declaimed as above.
					</p> 
					<p>Zeno of Citium in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi> relates that in a fit of heedlessness he
						sewed a sheepskin to his cloak. He was ugly to look at, and when
						performing his gymnastic exercises used to be laughed at. He was
						accustomed to say, raising his hands, "Take heart, Crates, for it is
						for the good of your eyes and of the rest of your body. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
						
						You will see
						these men, who are laughing at you, tortured before long by disease,
						counting you happy, and reproaching themselves for their
						sluggishness." He used to say that we should study philosophy to the
						point of seeing in generals nothing but donkey-drivers. Those who
						live with flatterers he declared to be as defenceless as calves in
						the midst of wolves ; for neither these nor those have any to
						protect them, but only such as plot against them. Perceiving that he
						was
					 <pb n='97'/> 
					dying, he would chant over himself this
						charm, "You are going, dear hunchback, you are off to the house of
						Hades,--bent crooked by old age." For his years had bowed him
						down.

					<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
					<p>When Alexander inquired whether he would like his
						native city to be rebuilt, his answer was, "Why should it be ?
						Perhaps another Alexander will destroy it again." Ignominy and
						Poverty he declared to be his country, which Fortune could never
						take captive. He was, he said, a fellow-citizen of Diogenes, who
						defied all the plots of envy. Menander alludes to him in the <hi
							rend='ital'>Twin Sisters</hi> in the following lines :
					</p>
					
					<p>Wearing a cloak you'll go about with me,
					</p> 
					<p>As once with
						Cynic Crates went his wife :
					</p> 
					<p>His daughter too, as he himself
						declared,

					<p>He gave in marriage for a month on trial.

					<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
					<p>Metrocles of Maroneia was the brother of
						Hipparchia. He had been formerly a pupil of Theophrastus the
						Peripatetic, and had been so far corrupted by weakness that, when
						he made a breach of good manners in the course of rehearsing a
						speech, it drove him to despair, and he shut himself up at home,
						intending to starve himself to death. On learning this Crates came
						to visit him as he had been asked to do, and after advisedly making
						a meal of lupins, he tried to persuade him by argument as well that
						he had committed no crime, for a prodigy would have happened if he
						had not taken the natural means of relieving
					 <pb n='99'/>
					
					himself. At last by reproducing the action he succeeded in
						lifting him from his dejection, using for his consolation the
						likeness of the occurrences. From that time forward Metrocles was
						his pupil, and became proficient in philosophy.

					</p>
					
					<p><hi rend='center'>Come hither, Hephaestus, Thetis now needeth

					</p> 
					<p>He divided things into such as are procurable for
						money, like a house, and such as can be procured by time and
						trouble, like education. Wealth, he said, is harmful, unless we put
						it to a worthy use.
					</p> 
					<p>He died of old age, having choked
						himself.
					</p> 
					<p>His disciples were Theombrotus and Cleomenes :
						Theombrotus had for his pupil Demetrius of Alexandria, while
						Cleomenes instructed Timarchus of Alexandria and Echecles of

					<p>Hipparchia too, sister of Metrocles, was captured by

					<p>She fell

						pay attention to any of her
					 <pb n='101'/> 
					suitors, their
						wealth, their high birth or their beauty. But to her Crates was
						everything. She used even to threaten her parents she would make
						away with herself, unless she were given in marriage to him. Crates
						therefore was implored by her parents to dissuade the girl, and did
						all he could, and at last, failing to persuade her, got up, took off
						his clothes before her face and said, "This is the bridegroom, here
						are his possessions ; make your choice accordingly ; for you will
						be no helpmeet of mine, unless you share my pursuits."

					<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
					<p>The

						and lived with him in public and went out to dinners with him.
						Accordingly she appeared at the banquet given by Lysimachus, and
						there put down Theodorus, known as the atheist, by means of the
						following sophism. Any action which would not be called wrong if
						done by Theodorus, would not be called wrong if done by Hipparchia.
						Now Theodorus does no wrong when he strikes himself : therefore
						neither does Hipparchia do wrong when she strikes Theodorus. He had
						no reply wherewith to meet the argument, but tried to strip her of
						her cloak. But Hipparchia showed no sign of alarm or of the
						perturbation natural in a woman. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>

					<p>There is

				<div2 n="9" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 9. MENEDEMUS</head> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
					<p>Menedemus was a pupil of
						Colotes of Lampsacus. According to Hippobotus he had attained such
						a
					 <pb n='107'/> 
					degree of audacity in wonder-working that he
						went about in the guise of a Fury, saying that he had come from
						Hades to take cognisance of sins committed, and was going to
						return and report them to the powers down below. This was his attire
						: a grey tunic reaching to the feet, about it a crimson girdle ; an
						Arcadian hat on his head with the twelve signs of the zodiac
						inwrought in it ; buskins of tragedy ; and he wore a very long beard
						and carried an ashen staff in his hand.
					</p> 
					<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
					<p>Such are the lives of
						the several Cynics. But we will go on to append the doctrines which
						they held in common--if, that is, we decide that Cynicism is really
						a philosophy, and not, as some maintain, just a way of life. They
						are content then, like Ariston of Chios, to do away with the
						subjects of Logic and Physics and to devote their whole attention to
						Ethics. And what some assert of Socrates, Diocles records of
						Diogenes, representing him as saying : "We must inquire into
					</p>
					
					<p><hi rend='center'>Whate'er of good or ill within our halls is
						wrought."<note n='a'>Hom. <hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv.
							392.</note></hi>
					</p> 
					<p>They also dispense with the ordinary
						subjects of instruction. At least Antisthenes used to say that
						those who had attained discretion had better not study literature,
						lest they should be perverted by alien influences. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
						
						So they get rid
						of geometry and music and all such studies. Anyhow, when somebody
						showed Diogenes a clock, he pronounced it a serviceable instrument
						to save one from being late for dinner. Again, to a man who gave a
						musical recital before him he said<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Antiope,</hi> Frag. 205
							Dind.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>By men's minds states are ordered well, and
						households,
					</p> 
					<p>Not by the lyre's twanged strings or flute's
						trilled notes.
					</p> <pb n='109'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
					<p>They hold further that "Life
						according to Virtue" is the End to be sought, as Antisthenes says in
						his <hi rend='ital'>Heracles</hi> : exactly like the Stoics. For
						indeed there is a certain close relationship between the two
						schools. Hence it has been said that Cynicism is a short cut to
						virtue ; and after the same pattern did Zeno of Citium live his
						life.
					</p> 
					<p>They also hold that we should live frugally, eating
						food for nourishment only and wearing a single garment. Wealth and
						fame and high birth they despise. Some at all events are vegetarians
						and drink cold water only and are content with any kind of shelter
						or tubs, like Diogenes, who used to say that it was the privilege of
						the gods to need nothing and of god-like men to want but little.
					</p>
					
					<p>They hold, further, that virtue can be taught, as Antisthenes
						maintains in his <hi rend='ital'>Heracles</hi>, and when once
						acquired cannot be lost ; and that the wise man is worthy to be
						loved, impeccable, and a friend to his like ; and that we should
						entrust nothing to fortune. Whatever is intermediate between Virtue
						and Vice they, in agreement with Ariston of Chios, account
						indifferent.
					</p> 
					<p>So much, then, for the Cynics. We must now pass
						on to the Stoics, whose founder was Zeno, a disciple of
						Crates.

				<div2 n="1" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 1. ZENO (333-261 B.C.)</head> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					<p>Zeno, the son
						of Mnaseas (or Demeas), was a native of Citium in Cyprus, a Greek
						city which had received Phoenician settlers. He had a wry neck, says
						Timotheus of Athens in his book <hi rend='ital'>On Lives.</hi>
						Moreover, Apollonius of Tyre says he was lean, fairly tall, and
						swarthy--hence some one called him an Egyptian vine-branch,
						according to Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Proverbs.</hi> He had thick legs ; he was flabby and
						delicate. Hence Persaeus in his <hi rend='ital'>Convivial
							Reminiscences</hi> relates that he declined most invitations to
						dinner. They say he was fond of eating green figs and of basking in
						the sun.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					<p>He was a pupil of Crates, as stated above. Next they
						say he attended the lectures of Stilpo and Xenocrates for ten
						years--so Timocrates says in his <hi rend='ital'>Dion</hi>--and
						Polemo as well. It is stated by Hecato and by Apollonius of Tyre in
						his first book on Zeno that he consulted the oracle to know what he
						should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was
						that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon,
						perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors. Now the way
						he came
					 <pb n='113'/> 
					across Crates was this. He was
						shipwrecked on a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus with a cargo of
						purple. He went up into Athens and sat down in a bookseller's shop,
						being then a man of thirty. As he went on reading the second book of
						Xenophon's <hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, he was so pleased that
						he inquired where men like Socrates were to be found. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
						
						Crates passed
						by in the nick of time, so the bookseller pointed to him and said,
						"Follow yonder man." From that day he became Crates's pupil, showing
						in other respects a strong bent for philosophy, though with too much
						native modesty to assimilate Cynic shamelessness. Hence Crates,
						desirous of curing this defect in him, gave him a potful of
						lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus ; and when he saw that
						he was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, with a blow of his
						staff he broke the pot. As Zeno took to flight with the lentil-soup
						flowing down his legs, "Why run away, my little Phoenician ?" quoth
						Crates, "nothing terrible has befallen you."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<p>For a certain
						space, then, he was instructed by Crates, and when at this time he
						had written his <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, some said in jest
						that he had written it on Cynosura, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> on the
						dog's tail.<note n='a'>Cynosura, Dog's Tail, like Dog's Head,
							Cynoscephalus, was the name of several promontories, notably one in
							Athens and one in Salamis. Relatively to Cynicism, "holding on by
							the dog's tail" would seem a more appropriate interpretation.</note> Besides the <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he wrote
						the following works :
					</p> 
					<p>Of Life according to Nature.
					</p> 
					<p>Of
						Impulse, or Human Nature.
					</p> 
					<p>Of Emotions.
					</p> 
					<p>Of Duty.
					</p>
					<pb n='115'/> 
					<p>Of Law.
					</p> 
					<p>Of Greek Education.
					</p> 
					<p>Of
						Vision.
					</p> 
					<p>Of the Whole World.
					</p> 
					<p>Of Signs.
					</p>
					
					<p>Pythagorean Questions.
					</p> 
					<p>Universals.
					</p> 
					<p>Of Varieties of
						Style.
					</p> 
					<p>Homeric Problems, in five books.
					</p> 
					<p>Of the Reading
						of Poetry.
					</p> 
					<p>There are also by him :
					</p> 
					<p>A Handbook of
						Rhetoric.
					</p> 
					<p>Solutions.
					</p> 
					<p>Two books of Refutations.
					</p>
					
					<p>Recollections of Crates.
					</p> 
					<p>Ethics.
					</p> 
					<p>This is a list of
						his writings. But at last he left Crates, and the men above
						mentioned were his masters for twenty years. Hence he is reported to
						have said, "I made a prosperous voyage when I suffered shipwreck."
						But others attribute this saying of his to the time when he was
						under Crates. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
						
						A different version of the story is that he was
						staying at Athens when he heard his ship was wrecked and said, "It
						is well done of thee, Fortune, thus to drive me to philosophy." But
						some say that he disposed of his cargo in Athens, before he turned
						his attention to philosophy.
					</p> 
					<p>He used then to discourse,
						pacing up and down in the painted colonnade, which is also called
						the colonnade or Portico<note n='a'>Our word "colonnade" better
							describes a roofed building, supported at least on one side by
							pillars and thus affording a public thoroughfare like an arcade or
							cloister, but open to the sun and air. Owing, however, to the Latin
							"porticus" Zeno's school has received in English literature the
							appellation of "the Porch." The frescoes or pictures, with which the
							Stoa was adorned, made it in some sense the National Gallery of
							Athens. For further information see by all means Frazer's note on
							Pausanias i. 15 (vol. ii. pp. 132-137).</note> of Pisianax, but
						which received its name
					 <pb n='117'/> 
					from the painting of
						Polygnotus ; his object being to keep the spot clear of a concourse
						of idlers. It was the spot where in the time of the Thirty 1400
						Athenian citizens had been put to death.<note n='a'>Probably the
							Thirty met in the Stoa and passed sentence of death there. It is not
							likely that this was the place of execution.</note> Hither, then,
						people came henceforth to hear Zeno, and this is why they were known
						as men of the Stoa, or Stoics ; and the same name was given to his
						followers, who had formerly been known as Zenonians. So it is stated
						by Epicurus in his letters. According to Eratosthenes in his eighth
						book <hi rend='ital'>On the Old Comedy,</hi> the name of Stoic had
						formerly been applied to the poets who passed their time there, and
						they had made the name of Stoic still more famous.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<p>The people
						of Athens held Zeno in high honour, as is proved by their depositing
						with him the keys of the city walls, and their honouring him with a
						golden crown and a bronze statue. This last mark of respect was also
						shown to him by citizens of his native town, who deemed his statue
						an ornament to their city,<note n='b'>Pliny, <hi
							rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xxxiv. 92.</note> and the men of Citium living
						in Sidon were also proud to claim him for their own. Antigonus
						(Gonatas) also favoured him, and whenever he came to Athens would
						hear him lecture and often invited him to come to his court. This
						offer he declined but dispatched thither one of his friends,
						Persaeus, the son of Demetrius and a native of Citium, who
						flourished in the 130th Olympiad (260-256 b.c.), at which time Zeno
						was already an old man. According to Apollonius of Tyre in his work
						upon Zeno, the letter of Antigonus was couched in the following
						terms :
					</p> <pb n='119'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					<p>"King Antigonus to Zeno the
						philosopher, greeting.
					</p> 
					<p>"While in fortune and fame I deem
						myself your superior, in reason and education I own myself inferior,
						as well as in the perfect happiness which you have attained.
						Wherefore I have decided to ask you to pay me a visit, being
						persuaded that you will not refuse the request. By all means, then,
						do your best to hold conference with me, understanding clearly that
						you will not be the instructor of myself alone but of all the
						Macedonians taken together. For it is obvious that whoever instructs
						the ruler of Macedonia and guides him in the paths of virtue will
						also be training his subjects to be good men. As is the ruler, such
						for the most part it may be expected that his subjects will
						become."
					</p> 
					<p>And Zeno's reply is as follows :
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					<p>"Zeno to
						King Antigonus, greeting.
					</p> 
					<p>"I welcome your love of learning in
						so far as you cleave to that true education which tends to advantage and not to that popular counterfeit of it which serves only
						to corrupt morals. But if anyone has yearned for philosophy, turning
						away from much-vaunted pleasure which renders effeminate the souls
						of some of the young, it is evident that not by nature only, but
						also by the bent of his will he is inclined to nobility of
						character. But if a noble nature be aided by moderate exercise and
						further receive ungrudging instruction, it easily comes to acquire
						virtue in perfection. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
						
						But I am constrained by bodily weakness, due
						to old age, for I am eighty years old ; and for that reason I am
						unable to join you. But I send you certain companions of my studies
						whose mental powers are not inferior to mine, while their
					</p> <pb
						n='121'/> 
					<p>bodily strength is far greater, and if you associate
						with these you will in no way fall short of the conditions necessary
						to perfect happiness."
					</p> 
					<p>So he sent Persaeus and Philonides the
						Theban ; and Epicurus in his letter to his brother Aristobulus
						mentions them both as living with Antigonus. I have thought it well
						to append the decree also which the Athenians passed concerning him.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
						It reads as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Tarn, <hi

							considers the decree, as we have it, a fusion of two genuine

					</p> 
					<p>"In the
						archonship of Arrhenides, in the fifth prytany of the tribe
						Acamantis on the twenty-first day of Maemacterion, at the
						twenty-third plenary assembly of the prytany, one of the presidents,
						Hippo, the son of Cratistoteles, of the deme Xypetaeon, and his
						co-presidents put the question to the vote ; Thraso, the son of
						Thraso of the deme Anacaea, moved :
					</p> 
					<p>"Whereas Zeno of Citium,

						it has seemed good to the people-- and may it

						Mnaseas, and to crown him with a golden crown according to the law,
						for his goodness and temperance, and to build him a tomb in the
						Ceramicus at the public cost. And that for the making of the crown
						and the building of the tomb, the people shall now elect five

						Anacaea, Philocles of Peiraeus, Phaedrus of Anaphlystus, Medon of
						Acharnae, Micythus of Sypalettus, and Dion of Paeania have been
						elected commissioners for the making of the crown and the
						building."
					</p> 
					<p>These are the terms of the decree.
					</p>
					
					<p>Antigonus of Carystus tells us that he never denied that he was a
						citizen of Citium. For when he was one of those who contributed to
						the restoration of the baths and his name was inscribed upon the
						pillar as "Zeno the philosopher," he requested that the words "of
						Citium" should be added. He made a hollow lid for a flask and used
						to carry about money in it, in order that there might be provision
						at hand for the necessities of his master Crates. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
						
						It is said that he
						had more than a thousand talents when he came to Greece, and that he
						lent this money on bottomry.<note n='a'>The security for the loan
							was either the cargo shipped or the vessel itself. As the risk was
							great, the interest was proportionately high. Demosth. <hi
								rend='ital'>Or.</hi> xxxiv. 23, l. 17, lvi. 17.</note> He used to
						eat little loaves and honey and to drink a little wine of good
						bouquet. He rarely employed men-servants; once or twice indeed he
						might have a young girl to wait on him in order not to seem a
						misogynist. He shared the same house with Persaeus, and when the
						latter brought in a little flute-player he lost no time in leading
						her straight to Persaeus. They tell us he readily adapted himself to
						circum-
					 <pb n='125'/> 
					stances, so much so that King Antigonus
						often broke in on him with a noisy party, and once took him along
						with other revellers to Aristocles the musician ; Zeno, however, in
						a little while gave them the slip. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
						
						He disliked, they say, to be
						brought too near to people, so that he would take the end seat of a
						couch, thus saving himself at any rate from one half of such
						inconvenience. Nor indeed would he walk about with more than two or
						three. He would occasionally ask the bystanders for coppers, in
						order that, for fear of being asked to give, people might desist
						from mobbing him, as Cleanthes says in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
							Bronze.</hi> When several persons stood about him in the Colonnade
						he pointed to the wooden railing at the top round the altar and
						said, "This was once open to all, but because it was found to be a
						hindrance it was railed off. If you then will take yourselves off
						out of the way you will be the less annoyance to us."
					</p> 
					<p>When
						Demochares, the son of Laches, greeted him and told him he had only
						to speak or write for anything he wanted to Antigonus, who would
						be sure to grant all his requests, Zeno after hearing this would
						have nothing more to do with him.<note n='a'>Zeno must have foreseen
							that this compliment would be followed by a request to use his
							undoubted influence with the king on behalf of Demochares. who, as
							an Athenian patriot and the nephew of Demosthenes, was out of favour
							at the Macedonian court. Indeed the fact of his making such advances
							at all is so strange that Ferguson (p. 172) and Tarn (p. 94, note
						11) feel constrained to offer hypothetical explanations.</note>
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
						After Zeno's death Antigonus is reported to have said, "What an
						audience I have lost."<note n='b'>Tarn, <hi rend='ital'>Antig.

						employed Thraso as his agent to request the Athenians to bury Zeno
						in the Ceramicus. And when asked why he admired him, "Because,"
						said
					 <pb n='127'/> 
					he, "the many ample gifts I offered him
						never made him conceited nor yet appear poor-spirited."
					</p> 
					<p>His
						bent was towards inquiry, and he was an exact reasoner on all
						subjects. Hence the words of Timon in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Silli</hi><note n='a'>Frag. 38 D.</note>:
					</p> 
					<p>A

					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
					<p>He
						used to dispute very carefully with Philo the logician and study
						along with him. Hence Zeno, who was the junior, had as great an
						admiration for Philo as his master Diodorus. And he had about him
						certain ragged dirty fellows, as Timon says<note n='c'>Frag. 39
							D.</note> in these lines :
					</p> 
					<p>The while he got together a crowd
						of ignorant serfs, who surpassed all men in beggary and were the

					</p> 
					<p>Zeno himself was sour and of a
						frowning countenance. He was very niggardly too, clinging to
						meanness unworthy of a Greek, on the plea of economy, If he pitched
						into anyone he would do it concisely, and not effusively, keeping
						him rather at arm's length. I mean, for example, his remark upon the
						fop showing himself off. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="`7"/>
						
						When he was slowly picking his way across a
						watercourse, "With good reason," quoth Zeno, "he looks askance at
						the mud, for he can't see his face in it." When a certain Cynic
						declared he had no oil in his flask and begged some of him, Zeno
						refused to give him any. However, as the man went away, Zeno bade
						him consider which of
					 <pb n='129'/> 
					the two was the more
						impudent. Being enamoured of Chremonides, as he and Cleanthes were
						sitting beside the youth, he got up, and upon Cleanthes expressing
						surprise, "Good physicians tell us," said he, "that the best cure
						for inflammation is repose." When of two reclining next to each
						other over the wine, the one who was neighbour to Zeno kicked the
						guest below him, Zeno himself nudged the man with his knee, and upon
						the man turning round, inquired, "How do you think your neighbour
						liked what you did to him?" 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
						
						To a lover of boys he remarked, "Just as
						schoolmasters lose their common-sense by spending all their time
						with boys, so it is with people like you." He used to say that the
						very exact expressions used by those who avoided solecisms were like
						the coins struck by Alexander : they were beautiful in appearance
						and well-rounded like the coins, but none the better on that
						account. Words of the opposite kind he would compare to the Attic
						tetradrachms, which, though struck carelessly and inartistically,
						nevertheless outweighed the ornate phrases. When his pupil Ariston
						discoursed at length in an uninspired manner, sometimes in a
						headstrong and over - confident way. "Your father," said he, "must
						have been drunk when he begat you." Hence he would call him a
						chatterbox, being himself concise in speech.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
					<p>There was a
						gourmand so greedy that he left nothing for his table companions. A
						large fish having been served, Zeno took it up as if he were about
						to eat the whole. When the other looked at him, "What do you
						suppose," said he, "those who live with you feel every day, if you
						cannot put up with my gourmandise in this single instance?" A
					
					<pb n='131'/> 
					youth was putting a question with more curiosity
						than became his years, whereupon Zeno led him to a mirror, and bade
						him look in it; after which he inquired if he thought it became
						anyone who looked like that to ask such questions. Some one said
						that he did not in general agree with Antisthenes, whereupon Zeno
						produced that author's essay on Sophocles, and asked him if he
						thought it had any excellence ; to which the reply was that he did
						not know. "Then are you not ashamed," quoth he, "to pick out and
						mention anything wrong said by Antisthenes, while you suppress his
						good things without giving them a thought?"
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
					<p>Some one having
						said that he thought the chainarguments of the philosophers seemed
						brief and curt, Zeno replied, "You are quite right ; indeed, the
						very syllables ought, if possible, to be clipped." Some one remarked
						to him about Polemo, that his discourse was different from the
						subject he announced. He replied with a frown, "Well, what value
						would you have set upon what was given out?" He said that when
						conversing we ought to be earnest and, like actors, we should have a
						loud voice and great strength ; but we ought not to open the mouth
						too wide, which is what your senseless chatterbox does. "Telling
						periods," he said, "unlike the works of good craftsmen, should need
						no pause for the contemplation of their excellences ; on the
						contrary, the hearer should be so absorbed in the discourse itself
						as to have no leisure even to take notes."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
					<p>Once when a young
						man was talking a good deal, he said, "Your ears have slid down and
						merged in your tongue." To the fair youth, who gave it as his
						opinion that the wise man would not fall in love,
					 <pb n='133'/>
					
					his reply was: "Then who can be more hapless than you fair
						youths?" He used to say that even of philosophers the greater number
						were in most things unwise, while about small and casual things they
						were quite ignorant. And he used to cite the saying of Caphisius,
						who, when one of his pupils was endeavouring to blow the flute
						lustily, gave him a slap and told him that to play well does not
						depend on loudness, though playing loudly may follow upon playing
						well.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Athen. xiv. p. 629
							b.</note> And to a youth who was talking somewhat saucily his
						rejoinder was, "I would rather not tell you what I am thinking, my
						lad."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
					<p>A Rhodian, who was handsome and rich, but nothing more,
						insisted on joining his class; but so unwelcome was this pupil, that
						first of all Zeno made him sit on the benches that were dusty, that
						he might soil his cloak, and then he consigned him to the place
						where the beggars sat, that he might rub shoulders with their rags ;
						so at last the young man went away. Nothing, he declared, was more
						unbecoming than arrogance, especially in the young. He used also to
						say that it was not the words and expressions that we ought to
						remember, but we should exercise our mind in disposing to advantage
						of what we hear, instead of, as it were, tasting a well-cooked dish
						or well-dressed meal. The young, he thought, should behave with
						perfect propriety in walk, gait and dress, and he used continually
						to quote the lines of Euripides about Capaneus :
					</p> 
					<p>Large means
						had he, yet not the haughtiness
					</p> 
					<p>That springs from wealth, nor
						cherished prouder thoughts

					<p>Again he would say that if we want to master the sciences there
						is nothing so fatal as conceit, and
					 <pb n='135'/> 
					again there
						is nothing we stand so much in need of as time. To the question "Who
						is a friend?" his answer was, "A second self (<hi rend='ital'>alter
							ego</hi>)." We are told that he was once chastising a slave for
						stealing, and when the latter pleaded that it was his fate to steal,
						"Yes, and to be beaten too," said Zeno. Beauty he called the flower
						of chastity, while according to others it was chastity which he
						called the flower of beauty.<note n='a'>The change of <foreign lang='greek'>fwnh=s fwnh/n</foreign> to <foreign lang='greek'> swfros1

							retain<foreign lang='greek'>fwnh/n,</foreign> which would give the
							meaning, "Beauty he called the flower of strength, while according
							to others it was the voice which he called the flower of
							beauty."</note> Once when he saw the slave of one of his
						acquaintance marked with weals, "I see," said he, "the imprints of
						your anger." To one who had been drenched with unguent, "Who is
						this," quoth he, "who smells of woman?" When Dionysius the Renegade
						asked, "Why am I the only pupil you do not correct?" the reply was,
						"Because I mistrust you." To a stripling who was talking nonsense
						his words were, "The reason why we have two ears and only one mouth
						is that we may listen the more and talk the less." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
						
						One day at a
						banquet he was reclining in silence and was asked the reason :
						whereupon he bade his critic carry word to the king that there was
						one present who knew how to hold his tongue. Now those who inquired
						of him were ambassadors from King Ptolemy, and they wanted to know
						what message they should take back from him to the king. On being
						asked how he felt about abuse, he replied, "As an envoy feels who is
						dismissed without an answer." Apollonius of Tyre tells us how,
						when Crates laid hold on him by the cloak to drag him from Stilpo,
						Zeno said, "The right way to seize a philosopher, Crates, is by the
						ears :
					 <pb n='137'/> 
					persuade me then and drag me off by them
						; but, if you use violence, my body will be with you, but my mind
						with Stilpo."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
					<p>According to Hippobotus he forgathered with
						Diodorus, with whom he worked hard at dialectic. And when he was
						already making progress, he would enter Polemo's school : so far
						from all selfconceit was he. In consequence Polemo is said to have
						addressed him thus : "You slip in, Zeno, by the garden door--I'm
						quite aware of it--you filch my doctrines and give them a Phoenician
						make-up." A dialectician once showed him seven logical forms
						concerned with the sophism known as "The Reaper," and Zeno asked him
						how much he wanted for them. Being told a hundred drachmas, he
						promptly paid two hundred : to such lengths would he go in his love
						of learning. They say too that he first introduced the word Duty and
						wrote a treatise on the subject. It is said, moreover, that he
						corrected Hesiod's lines thus:
					</p> 
					<p>He is best of all men who
						follows good advice: good too is he who finds out all things for
						himself.<note n='a'>
							<p>Hesiod's lines as they stand (<hi
								rend='ital'>Works and Days</hi>, 293 f.) run thus :
							</p> 
							<p>"He is
								best of all, who finds out everything for himself; that man too is
								good who follows good advice."
							</p></note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
					<p>The reason he gave
						for this was that the man capable of giving a proper hearing to what
						is said and profiting by it was superior to him who discovers
						everything himself. For the one had merely a right apprehension, the
						other in obeying good counsel superadded conduct.
					</p> 
					<p>When he was
						asked why he, though so austere, relaxed at a drinking-party, he
						said, "Lupins too are bitter, but when they are soaked become
						sweet." Hecato too in the second book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi> says that he indulged freely at such
						gatherings. And he would say, "Better to trip with the feet than
						with
					 <pb n='139'/> 
					the tongue." "Well-being is attained by
						little and little, and nevertheless it is no little thing itself."
						[Others attribute this<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> ii.
							32.</note> to Socrates.]
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
					<p>He showed the utmost endurance, and
						the greatest frugality ; the food he used required no fire to dress,
						and the cloak he wore was thin. Hence it was said of him :
					</p>
					
					<p>The cold of winter and the ceaseless rain
					</p> 
					<p>Come powerless
						against him : weak the dart
					</p> 
					<p>Of the fierce summer sun or

					<p>To bend that iron frame. He stands apart

					<p>Unspoiled by public feast and jollity :
					</p> 
					<p>Patient, unwearied
						night and day doth he
					</p> 
					<p>Cling to his studies of philosophy.
					</p>
					
					<p>Nay more : the comic poets by their very jests at his expense
						praised him without intending it. Thus Philemon says in a play, <hi
							rend='ital'>Philosophers</hi> :
					</p> 
					<p>This man adopts a new
						philosophy.
					</p> 
					<p>He teaches to go hungry : yet he gets
					</p>
					
					<p>Disciples. One sole loaf of bread his food ;
					</p> 
					<p>His best
						dessert dried figs ; water his drink.
					</p> 
					<p>Others attribute these
						lines to Poseidippus.
					</p> 
					<p>By this time he had almost become a
						proverb. At all events, "More temperate than Zeno the philosopher"
						was a current saying about him. Poseidippus also writes in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Men Transported</hi> :
					</p> 
					<p>So that for ten whole
						days
					</p> 
					<p>More temperate than Zeno's self he seemed.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
					<p>And in
						very truth in this species of virtue and in dignity he surpassed all
						mankind, ay, and in happiness ; for he was ninety-eight when he
						died and had enjoyed good health without an ailment to the
					</p> <pb
						n='141'/> 
					<p>last. Persaeus, however, in his ethical lectures makes
						him die at the age of seventy-two, having come to Athens at the age
						of twenty-two. But Apollonius says that he presided over the school
						for fifty-eight years. The manner of his death was as follows. As he
						was leaving the school he tripped and fell, breaking a toe. Striking
						the ground with his fist, he quoted the line from the <hi
							rend='ital'>Niobe</hi><note n='a'>Of Timotheus. See Nauck, <hi
								rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi> p. 51.</note>:
					</p> 
					<p>I come, I come, why
						dost thou call for me?
					</p> 
					<p>and died on the spot through holding
						his breath.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
					<p>The Athenians buried him in the Ceramicus and
						honoured him in the decrees already cited above, adding their
						testimony of his goodness. Here is the epitaph composed for him by

					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
					<p>We have ourselves mentioned
						the manner of Zeno's death in the <hi rend='ital'>Pammetros</hi> (a
						collection of poems in various metres) :
					</p> 
					<p>The story goes that
						Zeno of Citium after enduring many hardships by reason of old age
						was set free, some say by ceasing to take food; others say that once
						when he had tripped he beat with his hand upon the earth and cried,
						"I come of my own accord; why then call me?"<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 118.</note>
					</p> 
					<p>For there are
						some who hold this to have been the manner of his death.
					</p> 
					<p>So
						much then concerning his death.
					</p> 
					<p>Demetrius the Magnesian, in
						his work on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi>, says of him :
						his father, Mnaseas, being a merchant often went to Athens and
						brought away many books about Socrates for Zeno while still a boy.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
						Hence he had been well trained even before he left his native place.
						And thus it came about that on his arrival at Athens he attached
						himself to Crates. And it seems, he adds, that, when the rest were
						at a loss how to express their views, Zeno framed a definition of
						the end. They say that he was in the habit of swearing by "capers"
						just as Socrates used to swear by "the dog." Some there are, and
						among them Cassius the Sceptic and his disciples, who accuse Zeno at
						length. Their first count is that in the beginning of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he
					 <pb n='145'/> 
					pronounced the
						ordinary education useless : the next is that he applies to all men
						who are not virtuous the opprobrious epithets of foemen, enemies,
						slaves, and aliens to one another, parents to children, brothers to
						brothers, friends to friends.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
					<p>Again, in the <hi
						rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, making an invidious contrast, he
						declares the good alone to be true citizens or friends or kindred or
						free men ; and accordingly in the view of the Stoics parents and
						children are enemies, not being wise. Again, it is objected, in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he lays down community of wives, and
						at line 200 prohibits the building of temples, lawcourts and
						gymnasia in cities ; while as regards a currency he writes that we
						should not think it need be introduced either for purposes of
						exchange or for travelling abroad. Further, he bids men and women
						wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
						That the <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> is the work of Zeno is
						attested by Chrysippus in his <hi rend='ital'>De Republica.</hi> And
						he discussed amatory subjects in the beginning of that book of his
						which is entitled "The Art of Love." Moreover, he writes much the
						same in his <hi rend='ital'>Interludes.</hi> So much for the
						criticisms to be found not only in Cassius but in Isidorus of
						Pergamum, the rhetorician. Isidorus likewise affirms that the
						passages disapproved by the school were expunged from his works by
						Athenodorus the Stoic, who was in charge of the Pergamene library ;
						and that afterwards, when Athenodorus was detected and compromised,
						they were replaced. So much concerning the passages in his writings
						which are regarded as spurious.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
					<p>There have been eight persons
						of the name of Zeno. First the Eleatic, of whom more hereafter ; the
						second our present subject ; the third a Rhodian
					 <pb n='147'/>
					
					who wrote a local history in one volume ; the fourth a historian
						who wrote about the expedition of Pyrrhus into Italy and Sicily, and
						besides that an epitome of the political history of Rome and
						Carthage ; the fifth a pupil of Chrysippus, who left few writings
						but many disciples ; the sixth a physician of the school of
						Herophilus, a competent practitioner, though a poor writer; the
						seventh a grammarian, who besides other writings has left behind him
						epigrams; the eighth a Sidonian by birth and an Epicurean
						philosopher, lucid both in thinking and in style.

					<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
					<p>Of the many
						disciples of Zeno the following are the most famous : Persaeus, son
						of Demetrius, of Citium, whom some call a pupil and others one of
						the household, one of those sent him by Antigonus to act as
						secretary ; he had been tutor to Antigonus's son Halcyoneus. And
						Antigonus once, wishing to make trial of him, caused some false news
						to be brought to him that his estate had been ravaged by the enemy,
						and as his countenance fell, "Do you see," said he, "that wealth is
						not a matter of indifference ?"

					<p>I have decided to give a general account of

						writings, in which he has spoken as has no other of the Stoics. And
						his tenets in general are as follows. In accordance with my usual
						practice a summary statement must suffice.<note n='b'>Laertius

							Physics, &sect;&sect; 132-160.</note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
					<p>Philosophic doctrine, say the
						Stoics, falls into three parts : one physical, another ethical, and
						the third logical. Zeno of Citium was the first to make this
						division in his <hi rend='ital'>Exposition of Doctrine</hi>, and
						Chrysippus too did so in the first book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Exposition of Doctrine</hi> and the first book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>; and so
					 <pb n='151'/> 
					too
						Apollodorus and Syllus in the first part of their <hi
							rend='ital'>Introductions to Stoic Doctrine</hi>, as also Eudromus
						in his <hi rend='ital'>Elementary Treatise on Ethics</hi>, Diogenes
						the Babylonian, and Posidonius.
					</p> 
					<p>These parts are called by
						Apollodorus "Heads of Commonplace"; by Chrysippus and Eudromus
						specific divisions ; by others generic divisions. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
						
						Philosophy, they
						say, is like an animal, Logic corresponding to the bones and
						sinews, Ethics to the fleshy parts, Physics to the soul. Another
						simile they use is that of an egg : the shell is Logic, next comes
						the white, Ethics, and the yolk in the centre is Physics. Or, again,
						they liken Philosophy to a fertile field : Logic being the
						encircling fence, Ethics the crop, Physics the soil or the trees.
						Or, again, to a city strongly walled and governed by reason.
					</p>
					
					<p>No single part, some Stoics declare, is independent of any other
						part, but all blend together. Nor was it usual to teach them
						separately. Others, however, start their course with Logic, go on to
						Physics, and finish with Ethics ; and among those who so do are Zeno
						in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Exposition</hi>, Chrysippus,
						Archedemus and Eudromus.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
					<p>Diogenes of Ptolema&iuml;s, it is true,
						begins with Ethics ; but Apollodorus puts Ethics second, while
						Panaetius and Posidonius begin with Physics, as stated by Phanias,
						the pupil of Posidonius, in the first book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Lectures of Posidonius.</hi> Cleanthes makes not three,
						but six parts, Dialectic, Rhetoric, Ethics, Politics, Physics,
						Theology. But others say that these are divisions not of philosophic
						exposition, but of philosophy itself : so, for instance, Zeno of
						Tarsus. Some divide the logical part of the system into the two
						sciences of rhetoric and dialectic ; while
					 <pb n='153'/> 
					some
						would add that which deals with definitions and another part
						concerning canons or criteria : some, however, dispense with the
						part about definitions.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
					<p>Now the part which deals with canons
						or criteria they admit as a means for the discovery of truth, since
						in the course of it they explain the different kinds of perceptions
						that we have. And similarly the part about definitions is accepted
						as a means of recognizing truth, inasmuch as things are apprehended by means of general notions. Further, by rhetoric they
						understand the science of speaking well on matters set forth by
						plain narrative, and by dialectic that of correctly discussing
						subjects by question and answer ; hence their alternative definition of it as the science of statements true, false, and neither
						true nor false.
					</p> 
					<p>Rhetoric itself, they say, has three
						divisions : deliberative, forensic, and panegyric.
					</p> 
					<p>Rhetoric
						according to them may be divided into invention of arguments, their
						expression in words, their arrangement, and delivery ; and a
						rhetorical speech into introduction, narrative, replies to opponents, and peroration.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
					<p>Dialectic (they hold) falls under
						two heads : subjects of discourse and language. And the subjects
						fall under the following headings : presentations<note n='a'>The
							word <foreign lang='greek'> fantas i/a</foreign> (=appearance or
							appearing) is a technical term in Stoic logic for which no one
							English equivalent is as yet unanimously adopted. It denotes the
							immediate datum of consciousness or experience, whether presented to
							sense or in certain cases to the mind. Hence "presentation" is
							nearer than "perception" or "impression." It might be thought to
							correspond to Locke's "simple ideas," for which Hume substituted
							"impressions and ideas" ; but this is hardly so ; for <foreign lang='greek'> fantas i/ai</foreign> are "given" as it were from
							without, and then with them as materials the mind itself constructs
							general notions and concepts.</note> and the various products to
						which they give rise, propositions enunciated and their constituent
						subjects and predicates, and similar terms whether direct or
						reversed, genera and species, arguments
					 <pb n='155'/> 
					too,
						moods, syllogisms and fallacies whether due to the subject matter or
						to the language ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
						
						these including both false and true and negative
						arguments, sorites and the like, whether defective, insoluble, or
						conclusive, and the fallacies known as the Veiled, or Horned, No
						man, and The Mowers.
					</p> 
					<p>The second main head mentioned above as
						belonging to Dialectic is that of language, wherein are included
						written language and the parts of speech, with a discussion of
						errors in syntax and in single words, poetical diction, verbal
						ambiguities, euphony and music, and according to some writers
						chapters on terms, divisions, and style.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
					<p>The study of
						syllogisms they declare to be of the greatest service, as showing us
						what is capable of yielding demonstration ; and this contributes
						much to the formation of correct judgements, and their arrangement
						and retention in memory give a scientific character to our
						conception of things.
					</p> 
					<p>An argument is in itself a whole
						containing premisses and conclusion, and an inference (or syllogism)
						is an inferential argument composed of these. Demonstration is an
						argument inferring by means of what is better apprehended something
						less clearly apprehended.
					</p> 
					<p>A presentation (or mental
						impression) is an imprint on the soul : the name having been
						appropriately borrowed from the imprint made by the seal upon the
						wax. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
						
						There are two species of presentation, the one apprehending a
						real object, the other not. The former, which they take to be the
						test of reality, is defined as that which proceeds from a real
						object, agrees with that object itself, and has been imprinted
						seal-fashion and stamped upon the mind :
					 <pb n='157'/> 
					the
						latter, or non-apprehending, that which does not proceed from any
						real object, or, if it does, fails to agree with the reality itself,
						not being clear or distinct.
					</p> 
					<p>Dialectic, they said, is
						indispensable and is itself a virtue, embracing other particular
						virtues under it.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>Plut.<hi
							rend='ital'>Mor.</hi>874 e, and <hi rend='ital'>inf.</hi> &sect;&sect; 62,
							83.</note> Freedom from precipitancy is a knowledge when to give or
						withhold the mind's assent to impressions. By wariness they mean a
						strong presumption against what at the moment seems probable, so as
						not to be taken in by it. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>
						
						Irrefutability is strength in argument so
						as not to be brought over by it to the opposite side. Earnestness
						(or absence of frivolity) is a habit of referring presentations to
						right reason. Knowledge itself they define either as unerring
						apprehension or as a habit or state which in reception of
						presentations cannot be shaken by argument. Without the study of
						dialectic, they say, the wise man cannot guard himself in argument
						so as never to fall ; for it enables him to distinguish between
						truth and falsehood, and to discriminate what is merely plausible
						and what is ambiguously expressed, and without it he cannot
						methodically put questions and give answers.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
					<p>Overhastiness in
						assertion affects the actual course of events, so that, unless we
						have our perceptions well trained, we are liable to fall into
						unseemly conduct and heedlessness ; and in no other way will the
						wise man approve himself acute, nimblewitted, and generally
						skilful in argument ; for it belongs to the same person to converse
						well and to argue well, to put questions to the purpose and to
						respond to the questions put ; and all these qualifications are
						qualifications belonging to the skilled dialectician.
					</p> <pb
						n='159'/> 
					<p>Such is, summarily stated, the substance of their
						logical teaching. And in order to give it also in detail, <note
							n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra</hi>,&sect; 38 note. This distinction
							between the general and particular treatment is also frequent in
							Sextus Empiricus : <hi rend='ital'>e.g. Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> i. 5
							<foreign lang='greek'>o( kaqo/lo u lo/gos</foreign> as opposed to
							<foreign lang='greek'>o( ei)diko\ s lo/gos.</foreign></note> let me now
						cite as much of it as comes within the scope of their introductory
						handbook. I will quote verbatim what Diocles the Magnesian says in
						his <hi rend='ital'>Synopsis of Philosophers.</hi> These are his
						words :
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
					<p>"The Stoics agree to put in the forefront the
						doctrine of presentation and sensation, inasmuch as the standard by
						which the truth of things is tested is generically a presentation,
						and again the theory of assent and that of apprehension and thought,
						which precedes all the rest, cannot be stated apart from
						presentation. For presentation comes first ; then thought, which is
						capable of expressing itself, puts into the form of a proposition
						that which the subject receives from a presentation."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
					<p>There
						is a difference between the process and the outcome of presentation.
						The latter is a semblance in the mind such as may occur in sleep,
						while the former is the act of imprinting something on the soul,
						that is a process of change, as is set forth by Chrysippus in the
						second book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>Of the Soul (De
							anima).</hi> For, says he, we must not take "impression" in the
						literal sense of the stamp of a seal, because it is impossible to
						suppose that a number of such impressions should be in one and the
						same spot at one and the same time. The presentation meant is that
						which comes from a real object, agrees with that object, and has
						been stamped, imprinted and pressed seal-fashion on the soul, as
						would not be the case if it came from an unreal object.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
					<p>According to them some presentations are data of
					</p> <pb
						n='161'/> 
					<p>sense and others are not : the former are the impressions conveyed through one or more sense-organs ; while the
						latter, which are not data of sense, are those received through the
						mind itself, as is the case with incorporeal things and all the
						other presentations which are received by reason. Of sensuous
						impressions some are from real objects and are accompanied by
						yielding and assent on our part. But there are also presentations
						that are appearances and no more, purporting, as it were, to come
						from real objects.
					</p> 
					
					<p>Another division of presentations is into
						rational and irrational, the former being those of rational
						creatures, the latter those of the irrational. Those which are
						rational are processes of thought, while those which are irrational
						have no name. Again, some of our impressions are scientific, others
						unscientific : at all events a statue is viewed in a totally
						different way by the trained eye of a sculptor and by an ordinary
						man.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
					<p>The Stoics apply the term sense or sensation (<foreign lang='greek'> ai)/sqhs is</foreign>) to three things: (1) the current
						passing from the principal part of the soul to the senses, (2)
						apprehension by means of the senses, (3) the apparatus of the
						sense-organs, in which some persons are deficient. Moreover, the
						activity of the sense-organs is itself also called sensation.
						According to them it is by sense that we apprehend black and white,
						rough and smooth, whereas it is by reason that we apprehend the
						conclusions of demonstration, for instance the existence of gods
						and their providence. General notions, indeed, are gained in the
						following ways : some by direct contact, some by resemblance, some
						by analogy, some by transposition, some by composition, and some by
						contrariety.
					</p> <pb n='163'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
					<p>By incidence or direct contact
						have come our notions of sensible things ; by resemblance notions
						whose origin is something before us, as the notion of Socrates which
						we get from his bust ; while under notions derived from analogy come
						those which we get (1) by way of enlargement, like that of Tityos or
						the Cyclops, or (2) by way of diminution, like that of the Pygmy.
						And thus, too, the centre of the earth was originally conceived on
						the analogy of smaller spheres. Of notions obtained by transposition creatures with eyes on the chest would be an instance, while
						the centaur exemplifies those reached by composition, and death
						those due to contrariety. Furthermore, there are notions which imply
						a sort of transition to the realm of the imperceptible : such are
						those of space and of the meaning of terms. The notions of justice
						and goodness come by nature. Again, privation originates notions ;
						for instance, that of the man without hands. Such are their tenets
						concerning presentation, sensation, and thought.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
					
					<p>The standard
						of truth they declare to be the apprehending presentation, <hi
							rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> that which comes from a real object--according
						to Chrysippus in the twelfth book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Physics</hi> and to Antipater and Apollodorus. Bo&euml;thus,
						on the other hand, admits a plurality of standards, namely
						intelligence, senseperception, appetency, and knowledge ; while
						Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Exposition of
							Doctrine</hi> contradicts himself and declares that sensation and
						preconception are the only standards, preconception being a general
						notion which comes by the gift of nature (an innate conception of
						universals or general concepts). Again, certain others of the older
						Stoics make Right Reason the
					 <pb n='165'/> 
					standard ; so also
						does Posidonius in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the
							Standard.</hi>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
					<p>In their theory of dialectic most of them see
						fit to take as their starting-point the topic of voice. Now voice is
						a percussion of the air or the proper object of the sense of
						hearing, as Diogenes the Babylonian says in his handbook <hi
							rend='ital'>On Voice.</hi> While the voice or cry of an animal is
						just a percussion of air brought about by natural impulse, man's
						voice is articulate and, as Diogenes puts it, an utterance of
						reason, having the quality of coming to maturity at the age of
						fourteen. Furthermore, voice according to the Stoics is something
						corporeal : I may cite for this Archedemus in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On Voice</hi>, Diogenes, Antipater and Chrysippus in the
						second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
						
						For whatever
						produces an effect is body ; and voice, as it proceeds from those
						who utter it to those who hear it, does produce an effect. Reduced
						to writing, what was voice becomes a verbal expression, as "day";
						so says Diogenes. A statement or proposition is speech that issues
						from the mind and signifies something, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It
						is day." Dialect (<foreign lang='greek'>dia/- lektos</foreign> )
						means a variety of speech which is stamped on one part of the Greek
						world as distinct from another, or on the Greeks as distinct from
						other races ; or, again, it means a form peculiar to some particular
						region, that is to say, it has a certain linguistic quality ; <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> in Attic the word for "sea" is not <foreign lang='greek'> qa/lass a</foreign> but <foreign lang='greek'> qa/latt
								a,</foreign> and in Ionic "day" is not <foreign lang='greek'>h(me/ra</foreign> but <foreign lang='greek'>h(me/rh.</foreign>
					</p> 
					<p>Elements
						of language are the four-and-twenty letters. "Letter," however, has
						three meanings : (1) the particular sound or element of speech ; (2)
						its written symbol or character ; (3) its name, as
					 <pb n='167'/>
					
					Alpha is the name of the sound A. 
					
						<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
					
					Seven of the letters are
						vowels, <hi rend='ital'>a, e, &emacr; i, o, u, &omacr;,</hi> and six
						are mutes, <hi rend='ital'>b, g, d, k, p, t.</hi> There is a
						difference between voice and speech ; because, while voice may
						include mere noise, speech is always articulate. Speech again
						differs from a sentence or statement, because the latter always
						signifies something, whereas a spoken word, as for example <foreign lang='greek'> bli/tur i,</foreign> may be unintelligible-- which a
						sentence never is. And to frame a sentence is more than mere
						utterance, for while vocal sounds are uttered, things are meant,
						that is, are matters of discourse.
					</p> 
					<p>There are, as stated by
						Diogenes<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the Babylonian.</note>
						in his treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Language</hi> and by Chrysippus,
						five parts of speech : proper name, common noun, verb, conjunction,
						article. To these Antipater in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Words and
							their Meaning</hi> adds another part, the "mean."<note
								n='b'>Probably "adverb."</note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
					<p>A common noun or appellative
						is defined by Diogenes as part of a sentence signifying a common
						quality, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> man, horse ; whereas a name is a
						part of speech expressing a quality peculiar to an individual, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Diogenes, Socrates. A verb is, according to
						Diogenes, a part of speech signifying an isolated predicate, or, as
						others<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Sc.</hi> Apollodorus and his
							school; <hi rend='ital'>cf. inf.</hi> &sect; 64.</note>define it, an
						un-declined part of a sentence, signifying something that can be
						attached to one or more subjects, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "I
						write," "I speak." A conjunction is an indeclinable part of speech,
						binding the various parts of a statement together ; and an article
						is a declinable part of speech, distinguishing the genders and
						numbers of nouns, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> <foreign lang='greek'>o(,
							h(, to/, oi(, ai(, ta/.</foreign><note n='d'>= "the," masc., fem. and
								neut., singular and plural.</note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
					<p>There are five excellences
						of speech--pure Greek, lucidity, conciseness, appropriateness,
						distinction. By good Greek is meant language faultless in point
					
					<pb n='169'/> 
					of grammar and free from careless vulgarity.
						Lucidity is a style which presents the thought in a way easily
						understood ; conciseness a style that employs no more words than are
						necessary for setting forth the subject in hand ; appropriateness
						lies in a style akin to the subject ; distinction in the avoidance
						of colloquialism. Among vices of style barbarism is violation of the
						usage of Greeks of good standing ; while there is solecism when the
						sentence has an incongruous construction.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
					<p>Posidonius in his
						treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Style</hi> defines a poetical phrase as
						one that is metrical or rhythmical, thus mechanically avoiding the
						character of prose ; an example of such rhythmical phrase is :
					</p>
					
					<p><hi rend='center'>O mightiest earth, O sky, God's canopy.<note
						n='a'>Nauck, <hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>, <hi
							rend='ital'>Eur.</hi> 839.</note></hi>
					</p> 
					<p>And if such poetical
						phraseology is significant and includes a portrayal or
						representation of things human and divine, it is poetry.
					</p> 
					<p>A
						term is, as stated by Antipater in his first book <hi rend='ital'>On
							Terms</hi>, a word which, when a sentence is analysed, is uttered
						with complete meaning ; or, according to Chrysippus in his book <hi
							rend='ital'>On Definitions</hi>, is a rendering back one's
						own.<note n='b'>The author seems to have confused "term," which
							Antipater defines, with "definition," which, as Chrysippus says, is
							simply "giving back" the meaning in other words. Zeller's correction
							<foreign lang='greek'>i)di/ou a)po/dosi s</foreign> for <foreign lang='greek'>kai\ h( a)po/dosi s</foreign> comes from a scholion on
							Dionysius Thrax.</note> Delineation is a statement which brings one
						to a knowledge of the subject in outline, or it may be called a
						definition which embodies the force of the definition proper in a
						simpler form. Genus (in logic) is the comprehension in one of a
						number of inseparable objects of thought : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
						Animal ; for this includes all particular animals.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
					<p>A notion
						or object of thought is a presentation to the intellect, which
						though not really substance nor
					 <pb n='171'/> 
					attribute is
						quasi-substance or quasi-attribute.<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Stob. <hi rend='ital'>Ecl.</hi> i. 136. 21
							W.</note> Thus an image of a horse may rise before the mind,
						although there is no horse present.
					</p> 
					<p>Species is that which is
						comprehended under genus : thus Man is included under Animal. The
						highest or most universal genus is that which, being itself a genus,
						has no genus above : namely, reality or the real ; and the lowest
						and most particular species is that which, being itself a species,
						has no species below it, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Socrates.
					</p>
					
					<p>Division of a genus means dissection of it into its proximate
						species, thus : Animals are either rational or irrational
						(dichotomy). Contrary division dissects the genus into species by
						contrary qualities : for example, by means of negation, as when all
						things that are are divided into good and not good. Subdivision is
						division applied to a previous division : for instance, after
						saying, "Of things that are some are good, some are not good," we
						proceed, "and of the not good some are bad, some are neither good
						nor bad (morally indifferent)."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
					<p>Partition in logic is
						(according to Crinis) classification or distribution of a genus
						under heads : for instance, Of goods some are mental, others
						bodily.
					</p> 
					<p>Verbal ambiguity arises when a word properly, rightfully, and in accordance with fixed usage denotes two or more
						different things, so that at one and the same time we may take it in
						several distinct senses : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> in Greek, where
						by the same verbal expression may be meant in the one case that "A
						house has three times" fallen, in the other that "a dancing-girl"
						has fallen.
					</p> 
					<p>Posidonius defines Dialectic as the science
						dealing with truth, falsehood, and that which is neither true
					
					<pb n='173'/> 
					nor false ; whereas Chrysippus takes its subject to
						be signs and things signified. Such then is the gist of what the
						Stoics say in their theory of language.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
					<p>To the department
						dealing with things as such and things signified is assigned the
						doctrine of expressions, including those which are complete in
						themselves, as well as judgements and syllogisms and that of
						defective expressions comprising predicates both direct and
						reversed.<note n='a'>"Direct Predicate" answers to our Active Verb,
							"Predicate reversed" to our Passive ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.
								supra</hi>, 43.</note>
					</p> 
					<p>By verbal expression they mean that of
						which the content corresponds to some rational presentation. Of such
						expressions the Stoics say that some are complete in themselves and
						others defective. Those are defective the enunciation of which is
						unfinished, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "writes," for we inquire
						"Who ?" Whereas in those that are complete in themselves the
						enunciation is finished, as "Socrates writes." And so under the
						head of defective expressions are ranged all predicates, while
						under those complete in themselves fall judgements, syllogisms,
						questions, and inquiries.
					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
					<p>A predicate is, according to the
						followers of Apollodorus, what is said of something ; in other
						words, a thing associated with one or more subjects ; or, again, it
						may be defined as a defective expression which has to be joined on
						to a nominative case in order to yield a judgement. Of predicates
						some are adjectival [and so have personal subjects], as <hi

					<p>A judgement is that which is either
						true or false, or a thing complete in itself, capable of being
						denied in and by itself, as Chrysippus says in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Dialectical Definitions</hi> : "A judgement is that
						which in and by itself can be denied or affirmed, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> `It is day,' `Dion is walking.'" The Greek
						word for judgement (<foreign lang='greek'> a)ci/wma</foreign> ) is
						derived from the verb <foreign lang='greek'> a)ciou=n,</foreign> as
						signifying acceptance or rejection ; for when you say "It is day,"
						you seem to accept the fact that it is day. Now, if it really is
						day, the judgement before us is true, but if not, it is false. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
						
						There
						is a difference between judgement, interrogation, and inquiry, as
						also between imperative, adjurative, optative, hypothetical,
						vocative, whether that to which these terms are applied be a thing
						or a judgement. For a judgement is that which, when we set it
						forth in speech, becomes an assertion, and is either false or true :
						an interrogation is a thing complete in itself like a judgement but
						demanding an answer, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Is it day ?" and
						this is so far neither true nor false. Thus "It is day" is a
						judgement ; "Is it day ?" an interrogation. An inquiry is
						something to which we cannot reply by signs, as you can nod Yes to
						an interroga-
					 <pb n='177'/> 
					tion ; but you must express the
						answer in words, "He lives in this or that place."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
					<p>An
						imperative is something which conveys a command : <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
					</p> 
					<p><hi rend='center'>Go thou to the waters
						of Inachus.<note n='a'>Nauck, <hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi
							rend='super'>2</hi>, <hi rend='ital'>Adesp.</hi> 177 ; <hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Galen, xiii. p. 363 K.</note></hi>
					</p> 
					<p>An
						adjurative utterance is something ... A vocative utterance is
						something the use of which implies that you are addressing some one
						; for instance :
					</p> 
					<p><hi rend='center'>Most glorious son of
						Atreus, Agamemnon, lord of men.<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Iliad</hi> ix. 96.</note></hi>
					</p> 
					<p>A
						quasi-proposition is that which, having the enunciation of a
						judgement, yet in consequence of the intensified tone or emotion of
						one of its parts falls outside the class of judgements proper, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>Yea, fair indeed the Parthenon !
					</p>
					
					<p>How like to Priam's sons the cowherd is!<note n='c'>Nauck, <hi

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
					<p>There is also, differing
						from a proposition or judgement, what may be called a timid
						suggestion, the expression of which leaves one at a loss, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>Can it be that pain and life are in
						some sort akin ?
					</p> 
					<p>Interrogations, inquiries and the like are
						neither true nor false, whereas judgements (or propositions) are
						always either true or false.
					</p> 
					<p>The followers of Chrysippus,
						Archedemus, Athenodorus, Antipater and Crinis divide propositions
						into simple and not simple. Simple are those that consist of one or
						more propositions which are not ambiguous, as "It is day." Not
						simple are those that consist of one or more ambiguous propositions.
						<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
						They
					 <pb n='179'/> 
					may, that is, consist either of a single
						ambiguous proposition, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it
						is day," or of more than one proposition, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
						"If it is day, it is light."
					</p> 
					<p>With simple propositions are
						classed those of negation, denial, privation, affirmation, the
						definitive and the indefinitive ; with those that are not simple the
						hypothetical, the inferential, the coupled or complex, the
						disjunctive, the causal, and that which indicates more or less. An
						example of a negative proposition is "It is not day." Of the
						negative proposition one species is the double negative. By double
						negative is meant the negation of a negation, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is not not-day." Now this presupposes that
						it is day.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
					<p>A denial contains a negative part or particle and
						a predication : such as this, "No one is walking." A privative
						proposition is one that contains a privative particle reversing the
						effect of a judgement, as, for example, "This man is unkind." An
						affirmative or assertory proposition is one that consists of a noun
						in the nominative case and a predicate, as "Dion is walking." A
						definitive proposition is one that consists of a demonstrative in
						the nominative case and a predicate, as "This man is walking." An
						indefinitive proposition is one that consists of an indefinite
						word or words and a predicate, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Some one
						is walking," or "There's some one walking"; "He is in motion."
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
					<p>Of propositions that are not simple the hypothetical, according
						to Chrysippus in his <hi rend='ital'>Dialectics</hi> and Diogenes in
						his <hi rend='ital'>Art of Dialectic</hi>, is one that is formed by
						means of the conditional conjunction "If." Now this conjunction
						promises that the second of two things follows consequentially upon
						the first, as, for instance,
					 <pb n='181'/> 
					"If it is day, it
						is light." An inferential proposition according to Crinis in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Art of Dialectic</hi> is one which is introduced by the
						conjunction "Since" and consists of an initial proposition and a
						conclusion ; for example, "Since it is day-time, it is light." This
						conjunction guarantees both that the second thing follows from the
						first and that the first is really a fact. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
						
						A coupled proposition is
						one which is put together by certain coupling conjunctions, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is day-time and it is light." A
						disjunctive proposition is one which is constituted such by the
						disjunctive conjunction "Either," as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
						"Either it is day or it is night." This conjunction guarantees that
						one or other of the alternatives is false. A causal proposition is
						constructed by means of the conjunction "Because," <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Because it is day, it is light." For the
						first clause is, as it were, the cause of the second. A proposition
						which indicates more or less is one that is formed by the word
						signifying "rather" and the word "than" in between the clauses, as,
						for example, "It is rather day-time than night." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
						
						Opposite in
						character to the foregoing is a proposition which declares what is
						less the fact, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is less or not so
						much night as day." Further, among propositions there are some which
						in respect of truth and falsehood stand opposed to one another, of
						which the one is the negative of the other, as <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the propositions "It is day" and "It is not
						day." A hypothetical proposition is therefore true, if the
						contradictory of its conclusion is incompatible with its premiss,
						<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it is light." This is true.
						For the statement "It is not light," contradicting the conclusion,
						is incompatible with the premiss "It is day." On the other hand, a
						hypo-
					 <pb n='183'/> 
					thetical proposition is false, if the
						contradictory of its conclusion does not conflict with the premiss,
						<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, Dion is walking." For the
						statement "Dion is not walking" does not conflict with the premiss
						"It is day."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
					<p>An inferential proposition is true if starting
						from a true premiss it also has a consequent conclusion, as <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Since it is day, the sun is above the
						horizon." But it is false if it starts from a false premiss or has
						an inconsequent conclusion, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Since it
						is night, Dion is walking," if this be said in day-time. A causal
						proposition is true if its conclusion really follows from a premiss
						itself true, though the premiss does not follow conversely from the
						conclusion, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Because it is day, it is
						light," where from the "it is day" the "it is light" duly follows,
						though from the statement "it is light" it would not follow that "it
						is day." But a causal proposition is false if it either starts from
						a false premiss or has an inconsequent conclusion or has a premiss
						that does not correspond with the conclusion, as <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Because it is night, Dion is walking." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
						
						A
						probable judgement is one which induces to assent, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Whoever gave birth to anything, is that
						thing's mother." This, however, is not necessarily true ; for the
						hen is not mother of an egg.
					</p> 
					<p>Again, some things are possible,
						others impossible ; and some things are necessary, others are not
						necessary. A proposition is possible which admits of being true,
						there being nothing in external circumstances to prevent it being
						true, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Diocles is alive." Impossible is
						one which does not admit of being true, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
						"The earth flies." That is necessary which besides being true does
						not admit of being
					 <pb n='185'/> 
					false or, while it may admit
						of being false, is prevented from being false by circumstances
						external to itself, as "Virtue is beneficial." Not necessary is that
						which, while true, yet is capable of being false if there are no
						external conditions to prevent, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Dion is
						walking." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
						
						A reasonable proposition is one which has to start with
						more chances of being true than not, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "I
						shall be alive to-morrow."
					</p> 
					<p>And there are other shades of
						difference in propositions and grades of transition from true to
						false-- and conversions of their terms--which we now go on to
						describe broadly.
					</p> 
					<p>An argument, according to the followers of
						Crinis, consists of a major premiss, a minor premiss, and a
						conclusion, such as for example this : "If it is day, it is light ;
						but it is day, therefore it is light." Here the sentence "If it is
						day, it is light" is the major premiss, the clause "it is day" is
						the minor premiss, and "therefore it is light" is the conclusion. A
						mood is a sort of outline of an argument, like the following : "If
						the first, then the second ; but the first is, therefore the second
						is."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
					<p>Symbolical argument is a combination of full argument
						and mood ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If Plato is alive, he breathes
						; but the first is true, therefore the second is true." This mode of
						argument was introduced in order that when dealing with long complex
						arguments we should not have to repeat the minor premiss, if it be
						long, and then state the conclusion, but may arrive at the
						conclusion as concisely as possible : if A, then B.
					</p> 
					<p>Of
						arguments some are conclusive, others inconclusive. Inconclusive
						are such that the contradictory of the conclusion is not
						incompatible with combina-
					 <pb n='187'/> 
					tion of the
						premisses, as in the following : "If it is day, it is light ; but it
						is day, therefore Dion walks."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
							Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi> viii. 429.</note>
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
					<p>Of conclusive some are denoted by the common name of the whole
						class, "conclusive proper," others are called syllogistic. The
						syllogistic are such as either do not admit of, or are reducible to
						such as do not admit of, immediate proof in respect of one or more
						of the premisses ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If Dion walks, then
						Dion is in motion ; but Dion is walking, therefore Dion is in
						motion." Conclusive specifically are those which draw conclusions,
						but not by syllogism ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the statement "It
						is both day and night" is false : "now it is day ; therefore it is
						not night." Arguments not syllogistic are those which plausibly
						resemble syllogistic arguments, but are not cogent proof ; <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If Dion is a horse, he is an animal ; but
						Dion is not a horse, therefore he is not an animal."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
					<p>Further,
						arguments may be divided into true and false. The former draw their
						conclusions by means of true premisses ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
						"If virtue does good, vice does harm ; but virtue does good,
						therefore vice does harm."<note n='b'>The example is badly chosen,
							confusing contrary with contradictory.</note> Those are false which
						have error in the premisses or are inconclusive ; <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it is light ; but it is day,
						therefore Dion is alive." Arguments may also be divided into
						possible and impossible, necessary and not necessary. Further, there
						are statements which are indemonstrable because they do not need
						demonstration ; they are employed in the construction of every
						argument. As to the number of these, authorities differ ; Chrysippus
						makes them five. These are assumed alike in reason-
					</p> <pb
						n='189'/> 
					<p>ing specifically conclusive and in syllogisms both
						categorical and hypothetical. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
						
						The first kind of indemonstrable
						statement is that in which the whole argument is constructed of a
						hypothetical proposition and the clause with which the
						hypothetical proposition begins, while the final clause is the conclusion ; as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If the first, then the
						second ; but the first is, therefore the second is."<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> ii.
							157 <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> The second is that which employs
						a hypothetical proposition and the contradictory of the consequent,
						while the conclusion is the contradictory of the antecedent ; <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it is light ; but it is night,
						therefore it is not day." Here the minor premiss is the contradictory of the consequent ; the conclusion the contradictory of
						the antecedent. The third kind of indemonstrable employs a
						conjunction of negative propositions for major premiss and one of
						the conjoined propositions for minor premiss, concluding thence
						the contradictory of the remaining proposition ; <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is not the case that Plato is both dead
						and alive ; but he is dead, therefore Plato is not alive." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
						
						The
						fourth kind employs a disjunctive proposition and one of the two
						alternatives in the disjunction as premisses, and its conclusion is
						the contradictory of the other alternative ; <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Either A or B ; but A is, therefore B is
						not." The fifth kind is that in which the argument as a whole is
						constructed of a disjunctive proposition and the contradictory of
						one of the alternatives in the disjunction, its conclusion being
						the other alternative ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Either it is day
						or it is night ; but it is not night, therefore it is day."
					</p>
					
					<p>From a truth a truth follows, according to the Stoics, as <hi
						rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is light" from "It is day" ; and
					</p> <pb
						n='191'/> 
					<p>from a falsehood a falsehood, as "It is dark" from "It
						is night," if this latter be untrue. Also a truth may follow from a
						falsehood ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> from "The earth flies" will
						follow "The earth exists" ; whereas from a truth no falsehood will
						follow, for from the existence of the earth it does not follow
						that the earth flies aloft.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
					<p>There are also certain insoluble
						arguments<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> &sect; 44.</note>: the
						Veiled Men, the Concealed, Sorites, Horned Folk, the Nobodies. The
						Veiled is as follows<note n='b'>Here Laertius, as the text stands,
							gives examples of the Sorites and the Nobody, but none of the other
							three fallacies, the Veiled, Concealed, Horned.</note> : . . . "It
						cannot be that if two is few, three is not so likewise, nor that if
						two or three are few, four is not so ; and so on up to ten. But two
						is few, therefore so also is ten." . . . The Nobody argument is an
						argument whose major premiss consists of an indefinite and a
						definite clause, followed by a minor premiss and conclusion ; for
						example, "If anyone is here, he is not in Rhodes ; but there is some
						one here, therefore there is not anyone in Rhodes." . . .
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
					<p>Such, then, is the logic of the Stoics, by which they seek to
						establish their point that the wise man is the true dialectician.
						For all things, they say, are discerned by means of logical study,
						including whatever falls within the province of Physics, and again
						whatever belongs to that of Ethics. For else, say they, as regards
						statement and reasoning Physics and Ethics could not tell how to
						express themselves, or again concerning the proper use of terms, how
						the laws have defined various actions.<note n='c'>
							<p>The vulgate, in
								which I have made no change, has been regarded with suspicion. Von
								Arnim conjectures :
							</p> 
							<p>"For if the logician ought to have
								something to say about the correct use of terms, how could he fail
								to lay down the proper names for actions?"
							</p></note> Moreover, of
						the two kinds of common-sense inquiry included under Virtue one
						considers the nature of each
					 <pb n='193'/> 
					particular thing,
						the other asks what it is called. Thus much for their logic.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
					<p>The ethical branch of philosophy they divide as follows : (1) the
						topic of impulse ; (2) the topic of things good and evil ; (3) that
						of the passions ; (4) that of virtue ; (5) that of the end ; (6)
						that of primary value and of actions ; (7) that of duties or the
						befitting ; and (8) of inducements to act or refrain from acting.
						The foregoing is the subdivision adopted by Chrysippus, Archedemus,
						Zeno of Tarsus, Apollodorus, Diogenes, Antipater, and Posidonius,
						and their disciples. Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes treated the
						subject somewhat less elaborately, as might be expected in an older
						generation. They, however, did subdivide Logic and Physics as well
						as Ethics.
					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
					<p>An animal's first impulse, say the Stoics, is to
						selfpreservation, because nature from the outset endears it to
						itself, as Chrysippus affirms in the first book of his work <hi
							rend='ital'>On Ends</hi> : his words are, "The dearest thing to
						every animal is its own constitution and its consciousness thereof"
						; for it was not likely that nature should estrange the living thing
						from itself or that she should leave the creature she has made
						without either estrangement from or affection for its own
						constitution. We are forced then to conclude that nature in
						constituting the animal made it near and dear to itself ; for so it
						comes to repel all that is injurious and give free access to all
						that is serviceable or akin to it.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
					<p>As for the assertion made
						by some people that pleasure is the object to which the first
						impulse of animals is directed, it is shown by the Stoics to be
						false. For pleasure, if it is really felt, they declare
					</p> <pb
						n='195'/> 
					<p>to be a by-product, which never comes until nature by
						itself has sought and found the means suitable to the animal's
						existence or constitution ; it is an aftermath comparable to the
						condition of animals thriving and plants in full bloom. And nature,
						they say, made no difference originally between plants and animals,
						for she regulates the life of plants too, in their case without
						impulse and sensation, just as also certain processes go on of a
						vegetative kind in us. But when in the case of animals impulse has
						been superadded, whereby they are enabled to go in quest of their
						proper aliment, for them, say the Stoics, Nature's rule is to follow
						the direction of impulse. But when reason by way of a more perfect
						leadership has been bestowed on the beings we call rational, for
						them life according to reason rightly becomes the natural life. For
						reason supervenes to shape impulse scientifically.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
					<p>This is
						why Zeno was the first (in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the
							Nature of Man</hi>) to designate as the end "life in agreement with
						nature" (or living agreeably to nature), which is the same as a
						virtuous life, virtue being the goal towards which nature guides us.
						So too Cleanthes in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Pleasure,</hi>
						as also Posidonius, and Hecato in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
							Ends.</hi> Again, living virtuously is equivalent to living in
						accordance with experience of the actual course of nature, as
						Chrysippus says in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>De
							finibus</hi> ; for our individual natures are parts of the nature of
						the whole universe. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
						
						And this is why the end may be defined as life
						in accordance with nature, or, in other words, in accordance with
						our own human nature as well as that of the universe, a life in
						which we refrain from every action forbidden
					 <pb n='197'/> 
					by
						the law common to all things, that is to say, the right reason which
						pervades all things, and is identical with this Zeus, lord and ruler
						of all that is. And this very thing constitutes the virtue of the
						happy man and the smooth current of life, when all actions promote
						the harmony of the spirit dwelling in the individual man with the
						will of him who orders the universe. Diogenes then expressly declares the end to be to act with good reason in the selection of
						what is natural. Archedemus says the end is to live in the
						performance of all befitting actions.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
					<p>By the nature with
						which our life ought to be in accord, Chrysippus understands both
						universal nature and more particularly the nature of man, whereas
						Cleanthes takes the nature of the universe alone as that which
						should be followed, without adding the nature of the individual.
					</p>
					
					<p>And virtue, he holds, is a harmonious disposition, choice-worthy
						for its own sake and not from hope or fear or any external motive.
						Moreover, it is in virtue that happiness consists ; for virtue is
						the state of mind which tends to make the whole of life harmonious. When a rational being is perverted, this is due to the
						deceptiveness of external pursuits or sometimes to the influence of
						associates. For the starting-points of nature are never
						perverse.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
					<p>Virtue, in the first place, is in one sense the
						perfection of anything in general, say of a statue ; again, it may
						be non-intellectual, like health, or intellectual, like prudence.
						For Hecato says in his first book <hi rend='ital'>On the
							Virtues</hi> that some are scientific and based upon theory, namely,
						those which have a structure of theoretical principles, such as
						prudence
					 <pb n='199'/> 
					and justice ; others are
						non-intellectual, those that are regarded as co-extensive and
						parallel with the former, like health and strength. For health is
						found to attend upon and be co-extensive with the intellectual
						virtue of temperance, just as strength is a result of the building
						of an arch. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
						
						These are called non-intellectual, because they do not
						require the mind's assent ; they supervene and they occur even in
						bad men : for instance, health, courage. The proof, says Posidonius
						in the first book of his treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Ethics,</hi>
						that virtue really exists is the fact that Socrates, Diogenes, and
						Antisthenes and their followers made moral progress. And for the
						existence of vice as a fundamental fact the proof is that it is the
						opposite of virtue. That it, virtue, can be taught is laid down by
						Chrysippus in the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the
							End,</hi> by Cleanthes, by Posidonius in his <hi
								rend='ital'>Protreptica,</hi> and by Hecato ; that it can be taught
						is clear from the case of bad men becoming good.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
					<p>Panaetius,
						however, divides virtue into two kinds, theoretical and practical ;
						others make a threefold division of it into logical, physical, and
						ethical ; while by the school of Posidonius four types are
						recognized, and more than four by Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Antipater,
						and their followers. Apollophanes<note n='a'>One of the older
							Stoics ; <hi rend='ital'>cf. Frag. Vet. Stoic.</hi> i. 90.</note>
						for his part counts but one, namely, practical wisdom.
					</p>
					
					<p>Amongst the virtues some are primary, some are subordinate to
						these. The following are the primary : wisdom, courage, justice,
						temperance. Particular virtues are magnanimity, continence,
						endurance, presence of mind, good counsel. And wisdom they define as
						the knowledge of things good and evil and
					 <pb n='201'/> 
					of
						what is neither good nor evil ; courage<note n='a'>It is obviously
							not courage which is here defined, but apparently wisdom over again.
							Hence I have marked a lacuna.</note> as knowledge of what we ought
						to choose, what we ought to beware of, and what is indifferent ;
						
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
						justice . . . ; magnanimity as the knowledge or habit of mind which
						makes one superior to anything that happens, whether good or evil
						equally ; continence as a disposition never overcome in that which
						concerns right reason, or a habit which no pleasures can get the
						better of ; endurance as a knowledge or habit which suggests what we
						are to hold fast to, what not, and what is indifferent ; presence
						of mind as a habit prompt to find out what is meet to be done at any
						moment ; good counsel as knowledge by which we see what to do and
						how to do it if we would consult our own interests.
					</p>
					
					<p>Similarly, of vices some are primary, others subordinate : <hi
						rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> folly, cowardice, injustice, profligacy are
						accounted primary ; but incontinence, stupidity, ill-advisedness
						subordinate. Further, they hold that the vices are forms of
						ignorance of those things whereof the corresponding virtues are the
						knowledge.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
					<p>Good in general is that from which some advantage comes, and more particularly what is either identical with
						or not distinct from benefit. Whence it follows that virtue itself
						and whatever partakes of virtue is called good in these three
						senses--viz. as being (1) the source from which benefit results ; or
						(2) that in respect of which benefit results, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the virtuous act ; or (3) that by the agency
						of which benefit results, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the good man who
						partakes in virtue.
					</p> 
					<p>Another particular definition of good
						which they give is "the natural perfection of a rational being <hi
							rend='ital'>qua</hi> rational." To this answers virtue and, as
						being
					 <pb n='203'/> 
					partakers in virtue, virtuous acts and
						good men ; as also its supervening accessories, joy and gladness and
						the like. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
						
						So with evils : either they are vices, folly, cowardice,
						injustice, and the like ; or things which partake of vice, including
						vicious acts and wicked persons as well as their accompaniments,
						despair, moroseness, and the like.
					</p> 
					<p>Again, some goods are
						goods of the mind and others external, while some are neither mental
						nor external. The former include the virtues and virtuous acts ;
						external goods are such as having a good country or a good friend,
						and the prosperity of such. Whereas to be good and happy oneself is
						of the class of goods neither mental nor external. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
						
						Similarly of
						things evil some are mental evils, namely, vices and vicious actions
						; others are outward evils, as to have a foolish country or a
						foolish friend and the unhappiness of such ; other evils again are
						neither mental nor outward, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be yourself
						bad and unhappy.
					</p> 
					<p>Again, goods are either of the nature of
						ends or they are the means to these ends, or they are at the same
						time end and means. A friend and the advantages derived from him are
						means to good, whereas confidence, high - spirit, liberty, delight,
						gladness, freedom from pain, and every virtuous act are of the
						nature of ends.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
					<p>The virtues (they say) are goods of the
						nature at once of ends and of means. On the one hand, in so far as
						they cause happiness they are means, and on the other hand, in so
						far as they make it complete, and so are themselves part of it, they
						are ends. Similarly of evils some are of the nature of ends and some
						of means, while others are at once both means and ends. Your enemy
						and the harm he
					 <pb n='205'/> 
					does you are means ;
						consternation, abasement, slavery, gloom, despair, excess of grief,
						and every vicious action are of the nature of ends. Vices are evils
						both as ends and as means, since in so far as they cause misery they
						are means, but in so far as they make it complete, so that they
						become part of it, they are ends.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
					<p>Of mental goods some are
						habits, others are dispositions, while others again are neither
						the one nor the other. The virtues are dispositions, while accomplishments or avocations are matters of habit, and activities as
						such or exercise of faculty neither the one nor the other. And in
						general there are some mixed goods : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be
						happy in one's children or in one's old age. But knowledge is a pure
						good. Again, some goods are permanent like the virtues, others
						transitory like joy and walking-exercise.
					</p> 
					<p>All good (they say)
						is expedient, binding, profitable, useful, serviceable, beautiful,
						beneficial, desirable, and just or right. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
						
						It is expedient, because
						it brings about things of such a kind that by their occurrence we
						are benefited. It is binding, because it causes unity where unity is
						needed ; profitable, because it defrays what is expended on it, so
						that the return yields a balance of benefit on the transaction. It
						is useful, because it secures the use of benefit ; it is
						serviceable, because the utility it affords is worthy of all praise.
						It is beautiful, because the good is proportionate to the use made
						of it ; beneficial, because by its inherent nature it benefits ;
						choiceworthy, because it is such that to choose it is reasonable. It
						is also just or right, inasmuch as it is in harmony with law and
						tends to draw men together.
					</p> <pb n='207'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
					<p>The reason why they
						characterize the perfect good as beautiful is that it has in full
						all the "factors" required by nature or has perfect proportion. Of
						the beautiful there are (say they) four species, namely, what is
						just, courageous, orderly and wise ; for it is under these forms
						that fair deeds are accomplished. Similarly there are four species
						of the base or ugly, namely, what is unjust, cowardly, disorderly,
						and unwise. By the beautiful is meant properly and in an unique
						sense that good which renders its possessors praiseworthy, or
						briefly, good which is worthy of praise ; though in another sense it
						signifies a good aptitude for one's proper function ; while in yet
						another sense the beautiful is that which lends new grace to
						anything, as when we say of the wise man that he alone is good and
						beautiful.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
					<p>And they say that only the morally beautiful is
						good. So Hecato in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Goods</hi>, book
						iii., and Chrysippus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Morally
							Beautiful.</hi> They hold, that is, that virtue and whatever
						partakes of virtue consists in this : which is equivalent to saying
						that all that is good is beautiful, or that the term "good" has
						equal force with the term "beautiful," which comes to the same
						thing. "Since a thing is good, it is beautiful ; now it is
						beautiful, therefore it is good." They hold that all goods are equal
						and that all good is desirable in the highest degree and admits of
						no lowering or heightening of intensity. Of things that are, some,
						they say, are good, some are evil, and some neither good nor evil
						(that is, morally indifferent).
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
					<p>Goods comprise the virtues of
						prudence, justice, courage, temperance, and the rest ; while the
						opposites of these are evils, namely, folly, injustice, and
					
					<pb n='209'/> 
					the rest. Neutral (neither good nor evil, that is)
						are all those things which neither benefit nor harm a man : such as
						life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, fair fame and
						noble birth, and their opposites, death, disease, pain, ugliness,
						weakness, poverty, ignominy, low birth, and the like. This Hecato
						affirms in his <hi rend='ital'>De fine</hi>, book vii., and also
						Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics.</hi> and Chrysippus. For,
						say they, such things (as life, health, and pleasure) are not in
						themselves goods, but are morally indifferent, though falling under
						the species or subdivision "things preferred." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
						
						For as the property
						of hot is to warm, not to cool, so the property of good is to
						benefit, not to injure ; but wealth and health do no more benefit
						than injury, therefore neither wealth nor health is good. Further,
						they say that that is not good of which both good and bad use can be
						made ; but of wealth and health both good and bad use can be made ;
						therefore wealth and health are not goods. On the other hand,
						Posidonius maintains that these things too are among goods. Hecato
						in the ninth book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Goods</hi>, and
						Chrysippus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Pleasure</hi>, deny that
						pleasure is a good either ; for some pleasures are disgraceful,
						and nothing disgraceful is good. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
						
						To benefit is to set in motion or
						sustain in accordance with virtue ; whereas to harm is to set in
						motion or sustain in accordance with vice.
					</p> 
					<p>The term
						"indifferent" has two meanings : in the first it denotes the things
						which do not contribute either to happiness or to misery, as wealth,
						fame, health, strength, and the like ; for it is possible to be
						happy without having these, although, if they are used in a certain
						way, such use of them tends to
					 <pb n='211'/> 
					happiness or
						misery. In quite another sense those things are said to be
						indifferent which are without the power of stirring inclination or
						aversion ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the fact that the number of
						hairs on one's head is odd or even or whether you hold out your
						finger straight or bent. But it was not in this sense that the
						things mentioned above were termed indifferent, they being quite
						capable of exciting inclination or aversion. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
						
						Hence of these latter
						some are taken by preference, others are rejected, whereas
						indifference in the other sense affords no ground for either
						choosing or avoiding.
					</p> 
					<p>Of things indifferent, as they express
						it, some are "preferred," others "rejected." Such as have value,
						they say, are "preferred," while such as have negative, instead of
						positive, value are "rejected." Value they define as, first, any
						contribution to harmonious living, such as attaches to every good ;
						secondly, some faculty or use which indirectly<note
							n='a'>"Indirectly" : more literally "contributing, as intermediary
							(<foreign lang='greek'>me/shn</foreign>), to."</note> contributes
						to the life according to nature : which is as much as to say "any
						assistance brought by wealth or health towards living a natural
						life" ; thirdly, value is the full equivalent of an appraiser, as
						fixed by an expert acquainted with the facts--as when it is said
						that wheat exchanges for so much barley with a mule thrown in.<note
							n='b'>With Arnim's correction, wheat would exchange for 1 1/2 times
							the quantity of barley. The three meanings of <foreign lang='greek'>a)ci/a</foreign> are also given, but in a different
							order, by Stobaeus, <hi rend='ital'>Ecl.</hi> ii. 83. 10, who
							explains this as <foreign lang='greek'> a)moibh\ n tou= dokima
								stou=.</foreign></note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
					<p>Thus things of the preferred class are
						those which have positive value, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> amongst
						mental qualities, natural ability, skill, moral improvement, and the
						like ; among bodily qualities, life, health, strength, good
						condition, soundness of organs, beauty, and so forth ; and in the
						sphere of external things, wealth,
					 <pb n='213'/> 
					fame, noble
						birth, and the like. To the class of things "rejected" belong, of
						mental qualities, lack of ability, want of skill, and the like ;
						among bodily qualities, death, disease, weakness, being out of
						condition, mutilation, ugliness, and the like ; in the sphere of
						external things, poverty, ignominy, low birth, and so forth. But
						again there are things belonging to neither class ; such are not
						preferred, neither are they rejected.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
					<p>Again, of things
						preferred some are preferred for their own sake, some for the sake
						of something else, and others again both for their own sake and for
						the sake of something else. To the first of these classes belong
						natural ability, moral improvement, and the like ; to the second
						wealth, noble birth, and the like ; to the last strength, perfect
						faculties, soundness of bodily organs. Things are preferred for
						their own sake because they accord with nature ; not for their own
						sake, but for the sake of something else, because they secure not a
						few utilities. And similarly with the class of things rejected under
						the contrary heads.
					</p> 
					<p>Furthermore, the term Duty is applied to
						that for which, when done,<note n='a'>The reading <foreign lang='greek'> praxqe/n</foreign> is now accepted in place of
							<foreign lang='greek'> proaxqe/ n.</foreign> "Duty," it should be
							noted, is a very inadequate rendering of <foreign lang='greek'>
								kaqh=ko n,</foreign> which in the present passage applies to the
							proper behaviour of plants and animals no less than to that of human
							beings. <hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Stob. <hi rend='ital'>Ecl.</hi> ii.
							85. 13 <foreign lang='greek'>o)\ praxqe\n eu)/logo n a)pologi/ an e)/xei
								;</foreign> Sext. Emp. vii. 158.</note> a reasonable defence can be
						adduced, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> harmony in the tenor of life's
						process, which indeed pervades the growth of plants and animals. For
						even in plants and animals, they hold, you may discern fitness of
						behaviour.
					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
					<p>Zeno was the first to use this term <foreign lang='greek'> kaqh=ko n</foreign> of conduct. Etymologically it is
						derived from <foreign lang='greek'>kata/ tinas h(/kein,</foreign> <hi
							rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> reaching as far as, being up to, or incumbent
						on so and so.<note n='b'>The ordinary meaning of the verb <foreign lang='greek'> kaqh/ke in</foreign> is well seen in Hdt. vii. 22
							<foreign lang='greek'>o( ga\r *)/aqws e)sti\ o)/ros me/ga te kai\ o)nomas1 to\n e)s
								qa/lass1 an kath=ko n</foreign> ("for Athos is a great and famous
							mountain, reaching down to the sea"). The term seems to have passed
							from this meaning to signify figuratively that which extends to,
							affects, or is incumbent on us : as near an approach, perhaps, to
							the idea of duty as can be expected in any ancient system of Ethics,
							which regards human conduct not as obedience to law, but as
							determination and pursuit of good.</note> And it is an action in
						itself adapted
					 <pb n='215'/> 
					to nature's arrangements. For of
						the acts done at the prompting of impulse some, they observe, are
						fit and meet, others the reverse, while there is a third class which
						is neither the one nor the other.
					</p> 
					<p>Befitting acts are all
						those which reason prevails with us to do ; and this is the case
						with honouring one's parents, brothers and country, and intercourse
						with friends. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>
						
						Unbefitting, or contrary to duty, are all acts that
						reason deprecates, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to neglect one's
						parents, to be indifferent to one's brothers, not to agree with
						friends, to disregard the interests of one's country, and so forth.
						Acts which fall under neither of the foregoing classes are those
						which reason neither urges us to do nor forbids, such as picking up
						a twig, holding a style or a scraper, and the like.
					</p> 
					<p>Again,
						some duties are incumbent unconditionally, others in certain
						circumstances. Unconditional duties are the following : to take
						proper care of health and one's organs of sense, and things of that
						sort. Duties imposed by circumstances are such as maiming oneself
						and sacrifice of property. And so likewise with acts which are
						violations of duty. Another division is into duties which are always
						incumbent and those which are not. To live in accordance with virtue
						is always a duty, whereas dialectic by question and answer or
						walking-exercise and the like are not at all times incumbent. The
						same may be said of the violations of duty. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
						
						And in things
						intermediate also there are duties ; as that boys should obey the
						attendants who have charge of them.
					</p> 
					<p>According to the Stoics
						there is an eight-fold
					 <pb n='217'/> 
					division of the soul :
						the five senses, the faculty of speech, the intellectual faculty,
						which is the mind itself, and the generative faculty, being all
						parts of the soul. Now from falsehood there results perversion,
						which extends to the mind ; and from this perversion arise many
						passions or emotions, which are causes of instability. Passion, or
						emotion, is defined by Zeno as an irrational and unnatural movement
						in the soul, or again as impulse in excess.
					</p> 
					<p>The main, or most
						universal, emotions, according to Hecato in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On the Passions</hi>, book ii., and Zeno in his treatise
						with the same title, constitute four great classes, grief, fear,
						desire or craving, pleasure. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
						
						They hold the emotions to be
						judgements, as is stated by Chrysippus in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On the Passions</hi> : avarice being a supposition that
						money is a good, while the case is similar with drunkenness and
						profligacy and all the other emotions.
					</p> 
					<p>And grief or pain they
						hold to be an irrational mental contraction. Its species are pity,
						envy, jealousy, rivalry, heaviness, annoyance, distress, anguish,
						distraction. Pity is grief felt at undeserved suffering ; envy,
						grief at others' prosperity ; jealousy, grief at the possession by
						another of that which one desires for oneself ; rivalry, pain at the
						possession by another of what one has oneself. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>
						
						Heaviness or vexation
						is grief which weighs us down, annoyance that which coops us up and
						straitens us for want of room, distress a pain brought on by anxious
						thought that lasts and increases, anguish painful grief, distraction
						irrational grief, rasping and hindering us from viewing the
						situation as a whole.
					</p> <pb n='219'/> 
					<p>Fear is an expectation of
						evil. Under fear are ranged the following emotions : terror, nervous
						shrinking, shame, consternation, panic, mental agony. Terror is a
						fear which produces fright ; shame is fear of disgrace ; nervous
						shrinking is a fear that one will have to act ; consternation is
						fear due to a presentation of some unusual occurrence ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>
						
						panic is
						fear with pressure exercised by sound ; mental agony is fear felt
						when some issue is still in suspense.
					</p> 
					<p>Desire or craving is
						irrational appetency, and under it are ranged the following states :
						want, hatred, contentiousness, anger, love, wrath, resentment.
						Want, then, is a craving when it is baulked and, as it were, cut off
						from its object, but kept at full stretch and attracted towards it
						in vain. Hatred is a growing and lasting desire or craving that it
						should go ill with somebody. Contentiousness is a craving or desire
						connected with partisanship ; anger a craving or desire to punish
						one who is thought to have done you an undeserved injury. The
						passion of love is a craving from which good men are free ; for it
						is an effort to win affection due to the visible presence of beauty.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
						Wrath is anger which has long rankled and has become malicious,
						waiting for its opportunity, as is illustrated by the lines<note
							n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> i. 81, 82.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Even
						though for the one day he swallow his anger, yet doth he still keep
						his displeasure thereafter in his heart, till he accomplish it.
					</p>
					
					<p>Resentment is anger in an early stage.
					</p> 
					<p>Pleasure is an
						irrational elation at the accruing of what seems to be choiceworthy
						; and under it are ranged ravishment, malevolent joy, delight,
						transport. Ravishment is pleasure which charms the ear. Malevolent
						joy is pleasure at another's ills. Delight
					 <pb n='221'/> 
					is
					the mind's propulsion to weakness, its name in Greek (<foreign lang='greek'> te/ryis</foreign> ) being akin to <foreign lang='greek'> tre/yis</foreign> or turning. To be in transports of
						delight is the melting away of virtue.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
					<p>And as there are said
						to be certain infirmities in the body, as for instance gout and
						arthritic disorders, so too there is in the soul love of fame,
						love of pleasure, and the like. By infirmity is meant disease
						accompanied by weakness ; and by disease is meant a fond imagining
						of something that seems desirable. And as in the body there are
						tendencies to certain maladies such as colds and diarrhoea, so it is
						with the soul, there are tendencies like enviousness, pitifulness,
						quarrelsomeness, and the like.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="116"/>
					<p>Also they say that there are
						three emotional states which are good, namely, joy, caution, and
						wishing. Joy, the counterpart of pleasure, is rational elation ;
						caution, the counterpart of fear, rational avoidance ; for though
						the wise man will never feel fear, he will yet use caution. And they
						make wishing the counterpart of desire (or craving), inasmuch as it
						is rational appetency. And accordingly, as under the primary
						passions are classed certain others subordinate to them, so too is
						it with the primary eupathies or good emotional states. Thus under
						wishing they bring well-wishing or benevolence, friendliness,
						respect, affection ; under caution, reverence and modesty ; under
						joy, delight, mirth, cheerfulness.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="117"/>
					<p>Now they say that the wise
						man is passionless, because he is not prone to fall into such
						infirmity. But they add that in another sense the term apathy is
						applied to the bad man, when, that is, it means that he is callous
						and relentless. Further, the wise
					 <pb n='223'/> 
					man is said
						to be free from vanity ; for he is indifferent to good or evil
						report. However, he is not alone in this, there being another who is
						also free from vanity, he who is ranged among the rash, and that is
						the bad man. Again, they tell us that all good men are austere or
						harsh, because they neither have dealings with pleasure themselves
						nor tolerate those who have. The term harsh is applied, however, to
						others as well, and in much the same sense as a wine is said to be
						harsh when it is employed medicinally and not for drinking at
						all.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
					<p>Again, the good are genuinely in earnest and vigilant
						for their own improvement, using a manner of life which banishes
						evil out of sight and makes what good there is in things appear. At
						the same time they are free from pretence; for they have stripped
						off all pretence or "make-up" whether in voice or in look. Free too
						are they from all business cares, declining to do anything which
						conflicts with duty. They will take wine, but not get drunk. Nay
						more, they will not be liable to madness either; not but what
						there will at times occur to the good man strange impressions due to
						melancholy or delirium, ideas not determined by the principle of
						what is choiceworthy but contrary to nature. Nor indeed will the
						wise man ever feel grief; seeing that grief is irrational
						contraction of the soul, as Apollodorus says in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Ethics</hi>.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
					<p>They are also, it is declared,
						godlike; for they have a something divine within them ; whereas the
						bad man is godless. And yet of this word--godless or ungodly--there
						are two senses, one in which it is the opposite of the term "godly,"
						the other denoting the man who ignores the divine altogether : in
						this
					 <pb n='225'/> 
					latter sense, as they note, the term does
						not apply to every bad man. The good, it is added, are also
						worshippers of God ; for they have acquaintance with the rites of
						the gods, and piety is the knowledge of how to serve the gods.
						Further, they will sacrifice to the gods and they keep themselves
						pure ; for they avoid all acts that are offences against the gods,
						and the gods think highly of them : for they are holy and just in
						what concerns the gods. The wise too are the only priests; for they
						have made sacrifices their study, as also the building of temples,
						purifications, and all the other matters appertaining to the
						gods.
					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="120"/>
					<p>The Stoics approve also of honouring parents and
						brothers in the second place next after the gods. They further
						maintain that parental affection for children is natural to the
						good, but not to the bad. It is one of their tenets that sins are
						all equal : so Chrysippus in the fourth book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Ethical Questions,</hi> as well as Persaeus and Zeno.
						For if one truth is not more true than another, neither is one
						falsehood more false than another, and in the same way one deceit
						is not more so than another, nor sin than sin. For he who is a
						hundred furlongs from Canopus and he who is only one furlong away
						are equally not in Canopus, and so too he who commits the greater
						sin and he who commits the less are equally not in the path of right
						conduct. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="121"/>
						
						But Heraclides of Tarsus, who was the disciple of Antipater
						of Tarsus, and Athenodorus both assert that sins are not equal.
					</p>
					
					<p>Again, the Stoics say that the wise man will take part in
						politics, if nothing hinders him--so, for instance, Chrysippus in
						the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Various Types of
							Life</hi>--since thus he will restrain vice and promote virtue. Also
						(they maintain) he
					 <pb n='227'/> 
					will marry, as Zeno says in
						his <hi rend='ital'>Republic,</hi> and beget children. Moreover,
						they say that the wise man will never form mere opinions, that is to
						say, he will never give assent to anything that is false ; that he
						will also play the Cynic, Cynicism being a short cut to virtue, as
						Apollodorus calls it in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics</hi> ; that he
						will even turn cannibal under stress of circumstances. They
						declare that he alone is free and bad men are slaves, freedom being
						power of independent action, whereas slavery is privation of the
						same; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="122"/>
						
						though indeed there is also a second form of slavery
						consisting in subordination, and a third which implies possession of
						the slave as well as his subordination; the correlative of such
						servitude being lordship ; and this too is evil. Moreover, according
						to them not only are the wise free, they are also kings ; kingship
						being irresponsible rule, which none but the wise can maintain: so
						Chrysippus in his treatise vindicating Zeno's use of terminology.
						For he holds that knowledge of good and evil is a necessary
						attribute of the ruler, and that no bad man is acquainted with this
						science. Similarly the wise and good alone are fit to be
						magistrates, judges, or orators, whereas among the bad there is not
						one so qualified. Furthermore, the wise are infallible, not being
						liable to error. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="123"/>
						
						They are also without offence; for they do no hurt
						to others or to themselves. At the same time they are not pitiful
						and make no allowance for anyone; they never relax the penalties
						fixed by the laws, since indulgence and pity and even equitable
						consideration are marks of a weak mind, which affects kindness in
						place of chastizing. Nor do they deem punishments too severe. Again,
						they say that the wise man never wonders at any of the
					</p> <pb
						n='229'/> 
					<p>things which appear extraordinary, such as Charon's
						mephitic caverns,<note n='a'>Regarded as passages down to the
							underworld; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Virg. <hi rend='ital'>Aen.</hi>
							vi. 240 <hi rend='ital'>seq.,</hi> 299.</note> ebbings of the tide,
						hot springs or fiery eruptions. Nor yet, they go on to say, will the
						wise man live in solitude ; for he is naturally made for society and
						action. He will, however, submit to training to augment his powers
						of bodily endurance.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="124"/>
					<p>And the wise man, they say, will offer
						prayers, and ask for good things from the gods : so Posidonius in
						the first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Duties,</hi> and
						Hecato in his third book <hi rend='ital'>On Paradoxes.</hi>
						Friendship, they declare, exists only between the wise and good, by
						reason of their likeness to one another. And by friendship they mean
						a common use of all that has to do with life, wherein we treat our
						friends as we should ourselves. They argue that a friend is worth
						having for his own sake and that it is a good thing to have many
						friends. But among the bad there is, they hold, no such thing as
						friendship, and thus no bad man has a friend. Another of their
						tenets is that the unwise are all mad, inasmuch as they are not wise
						but do what they do from that madness which is the equivalent of
						their folly.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="125"/>
					<p>Furthermore, the wise man does all things well,
						just as we say that Ismenias plays all airs on the flute well. Also
						everything belongs to the wise. For the law, they say, has conferred
						upon them a perfect right to all things. It is true that certain
						things are said to belong to the bad, just as what has been
						dishonestly acquired may be said, in one sense, to belong to the
						state, in another sense to those who are enjoying it.
					</p> 
					<p>They
						hold that the virtues involve one another, and that the possessor of
						one is the possessor of all,
					 <pb n='231'/> 
					inasmuch as they
						have common principles, as Chrysippus says in the first book of his
						work <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues,</hi> Apollodorus in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Physics according to the Early School,</hi> and Hecato
						in the third book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues.</hi>
						<milestone unit="section" n="126"/>
						
						For if a man be possessed of virtue, he is at once able to discover
						and to put into practice what he ought to do. Now such rules of
						conduct comprise rules for choosing, enduring, staying, and
						distributing ; so that if a man does some things by intelligent
						choice, some things with fortitude, some things by way of just
						distribution, and some steadily, he is at once wise, courageous,
						just, and temperate. And each of the virtues has a particular
						subject with which it deals, as, for instance, courage is concerned
						with things that must be endured, practical wisdom with acts to be
						done, acts from which one must abstain, and those which fall under
						neither head. Similarly each of the other virtues is concerned with
						its own proper sphere. To wisdom are subordinate good counsel and
						understanding ; to temperance, good discipline and orderliness ; to
						justice, equality and fair-mindedness ; to courage, constancy and
						vigour.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>
					<p>It is a tenet of theirs that between virtue and vice
						there is nothing intermediate, whereas according to the Peripatetics
						there is, namely, the state of moral improvement. For, say the
						Stoics, just as a stick must be either straight or crooked, so a man
						must be either just or unjust. Nor again are there degrees of
						justice and injustice ; and the same rule applies to the other
						virtues. Further, while Chrysippus holds that virtue can be lost,
						Cleanthes maintains that it cannot. According to the former it may
						be lost in consequence of drunkenness or melancholy ;
					</p> <pb
						n='233'/> 
					<p>the latter takes it to be inalienable owing to the
						certainty of our mental apprehension. And virtue in itself they hold
						to be worthy of choice for its own sake. At all events we are
						ashamed of bad conduct as if we knew that nothing is really good but
						the morally beautiful. Moreover, they hold that it is in itself
						sufficient to ensure well-being : thus Zeno, and Chrysippus in the
						first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues,</hi> and
						Hecato in the second book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On
						Goods:</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>
						
						"For if magnanimity by itself alone can raise us far
						above everything, and if magnanimity is but a part of virtue, then
						too virtue as a whole will be sufficient in itself for well-being
						--despising all things that seem troublesome." Panaetius, however,
						and Posidonius deny that virtue is self-sufficing : on the contrary,
						health is necessary, and some means of living and strength.
					</p>
					
					<p>Another tenet of theirs is the perpetual exercise of virtue, as
						held by Cleanthes and his followers. For virtue can never be lost,
						and the good man is always exercising his mind, which is perfect.
						Again, they say that justice, as well as law and right reason,
						exists by nature and not by convention : so Chrysippus in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On the Morally Beautiful.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="129"/>
						
						Neither do they think
						that the divergence of opinion between philosophers is any reason
						for abandoning the study of philosophy, since at that rate we should
						have to give up life altogether : so Posidonius in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Exhortations.</hi> Chrysippus allows that the ordinary
						Greek education is serviceable.
					</p> 
					<p>It is their doctrine that
						there can be no question of right as between man and the lower
						animals, because of their unlikeness. Thus Chrysippus in the first
						book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Justice,</hi> and Posi-
					
					<pb n='235'/> 
					donius in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>De
						officio.</hi> Further, they say that the wise man will feel
						affection for the youths who by their countenance show a natural
						endowment for virtue. So Zeno in his <hi rend='ital'>Republic,</hi>
						Chrysippus in book i. of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Modes of
							Life,</hi> and Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics.</hi>
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="130"/>
					<p>Their definition of love is an effort toward friendliness due
						to visible beauty appearing, its sole end being friendship, not
						bodily enjoyment. At all events, they allege that Thrasonides,
						although he had his mistress in his power, abstained from her
						because she hated him. By which it is shown, they think, that love
						depends upon regard, as Chrysippus says in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>Of Love,</hi> and is not sent by the gods. And beauty
						they describe as the bloom or flower of virtue.
					</p> 
					<p>Of the three
						kinds of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the rational,
						they declare that we ought to choose the last, for that a rational
						being is expressly produced by nature for contemplation and for
						action. They tell us that the wise man will for reasonable cause
						make his own exit from life, on his country's behalf or for the sake
						of his friends, or if he suffer intolerable pain, mutilation, or
						incurable disease.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="131"/>
					<p>It is also their doctrine that amongst the
						wise there should be a community of wives with free choice of
						partners, as Zeno says in his <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> and
						Chrysippus in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Government</hi> [and
						not only they, but also Diogenes the Cynic and Plato].<note
							n='a'>The words in brackets read like a marginal note, afterwards
							inserted in the text.</note> Under such circumstances we shall feel
						paternal affection for all the children alike, and there will be an
						end of the jealousies arising from adultery. The best form of
						government they hold to be a mixture
					 <pb n='237'/> 
					of
						democracy, kingship, and aristocracy (or the rule of the best).
					</p>
					
					<p>Such, then, are the statements they make in their ethical
						doctrines, with much more besides, together with their proper proofs
						: let this, however, suffice for a statement of them in a summary
						and elementary form.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="132"/>
					<p>Their physical doctrine they divide into
						sections (1) about bodies; (2) about principles; (3) about elements;
						(4) about the gods; (5) about bounding surfaces and space whether
						filled or empty. This is a division into species; but the generic
						division is into three parts, dealing with (i.) the universe; (ii.)
						the elements; (iii.) the subject of causation.
					</p> 
					<p>The part
						dealing with the universe admits, they say, of division into two :
						for with one aspect of it the mathematicians also are concerned, in
						so far as they treat questions relating to the fixed stars and the
						planets, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> whether the sun is or is not just
						so large as it appears to be, and the same about the moon, the
						question of their revolutions, and other inquiries of the same sort.
						But there is another aspect or field of cosmological<note
							n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>au)tou== tou= ko/smou.</foreign></note>
						inquiry, which belongs to the physicists alone : 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="133"/>
						
						this includes such
						questions as what the substance of the universe is, whether the sun
						and the stars are made up of form and matter, whether the world has
						had a beginning in time or not, whether it is animate or inanimate,
						whether it is destructible or indestructible, whether it is governed
						by providence, and all the rest. The part concerned with causation,
						again, is itself subdivided into two. And in one of its aspects
						medical inquiries have a share in it, in so far as it involves
						investigation of the ruling principle of the soul and the phenomena
						of
					 <pb n='239'/> 
					soul, seeds, and the like. Whereas the other
						part is claimed by the mathematicians also, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> how vision is to be explained, what causes the
						image on the mirror, what is the origin of clouds, thunder,
						rainbows, halos, comets, and the like.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>
					<p>They hold that there
						are two principles in the universe, the active principle and the
						passive. The passive principle, then, is a substance without
						quality, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> matter, whereas the active is the
						reason inherent in this substance, that is God. For he is
						everlasting and is the artificer of each several thing throughout
						the whole extent of matter. This doctrine is laid down by Zeno of
						Citium in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Existence,</hi> Cleanthes
						in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Atoms,</hi> Chrysippus in the first
						book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> towards the end, Archedemus
						in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Elements,</hi> and Posidonius in
						the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Exposition.</hi>
						There is a difference, according to them, between principles and
						elements ; the former being without generation or destruction,
						whereas the elements are destroyed when all things are resolved into
						fire. Moreover, the principles are incorporeal and destitute of
						form, while the elements have been endowed with form.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="135"/>
					<p>Body is
						defined by Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> as that
						which is extended in three dimensions, length, breadth, and depth.
						This is also called solid body. But surface is the extremity of a
						solid body, or that which has length and breadth only without depth.
						That surface exists not only in our thought but also in reality is
						maintained by Posidonius in the third book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena.</hi> A line is the extremity of a
						surface or length without breadth, or that which has length alone. A
						point is the extremity of a line, the smallest possible mark or
						dot.
					</p> <pb n='241'/> 
					<p>God is one and the same with Reason, Fate,
						and Zeus ; he is also called by many other names. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>
						
						In the beginning
						he was by himself ; he transformed the whole of substance through
						air into water, and just as in animal generation the seed has a
						moist vehicle, so in cosmic moisture God, who is the seminal reason
						of the universe, remains behind in the moisture as such an agent,
						adapting matter to himself with a view to the next stage of
						creation. Thereupon he created first of all the four elements, fire,
						water, air, earth. They are discussed by Zeno in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus in the first book of
						his <hi rend='ital'>Physics,</hi> and by Archedemus in a work <hi
							rend='ital'>On Elements.</hi> An element is defined as that from
						which particular things first come to be at their birth and into
						which they are finally resolved. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>
						
						The four elements together
						constitute unqualified substance or matter. Fire is the hot element,
						water the moist, air the cold, earth the dry. Not but what the
						quality of dryness is also found in the air.<note n='a'>"The same
							part" <foreign lang='greek'>(to\ au)to\ me/ros)</foreign> may refer to
							the quality of dryness last mentioned.</note> Fire has the uppermost
						place ; it is also called aether, and in it the sphere of the fixed
						stars is first created ; then comes the sphere of the planets, next
						to that the air, then the water, and lowest of all the earth, which
						is at the centre of all things.
					</p> 
					<p>The term universe or cosmos
						is used by them in three senses : (1) of God himself, the individual
						being whose quality is derived from the whole of substance ; he is
						indestructible and ingenerable, being the artificer of this orderly
						arrangement, who at stated periods of time absorbs into himself the
						whole of substance and again creates it from himself.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="138"/>
						
						(2) Again,
						they give the name of cosmos to the orderly
					 <pb n='243'/>
					
					arrangement of the heavenly bodies in itself as such ; and (3) in
						the third place to that whole of which these two are parts. Again,
						the cosmos is defined as the individual being qualifying the whole
						of substance, or, in the words of Posidonius in his elementary
						treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena</hi>, a system made
						up of heaven and earth and the natures in them, or, again, as a
						system constituted by gods and men and all things created for their
						sake. By heaven is meant the extreme circumference or ring in which
						the deity has his seat.
					</p> 
					<p>The world,<note n='a'>"World" is
						normally the best rendering of <foreign lang='greek'>
							ko/smos.</foreign> "Universe," which some prefer, better suits
						<foreign lang='greek'>to\ o(/lon.</foreign></note> in their view, is
						ordered by reason and providence : so says Chrysippus in the fifth
						book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Providence</hi> and
						Posidonius in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Gods</hi>, book
						iii.--inasmuch as reason pervades every part of it, just as does the
						soul in us. Only there is a difference of degree ; in some parts
						there is more of it, in others less. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="139"/>
						
						For through some parts it
						passes as a "hold" or containing force, as is the case with our
						bones and sinews ; while through others it passes as intelligence,
						as in the ruling part of the soul. Thus, then, the whole world is a
						living being, endowed with soul and reason, and having aether for
						its ruling principle : so says Antipater of Tyre in the eighth book
						of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the Cosmos.</hi> Chrysippus in
						the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Providence</hi> and
						Posidonius in his book <hi rend='ital'>On the Gods</hi> say that the
						heaven, but Cleanthes that the sun, is the ruling power of the
						world. Chrysippus, however, in the course of the same work gives a
						somewhat different account, namely, that it is the purer part of the
						aether ; the same which they declare to be preeminently God and
						always to have, as it were in sensible fashion, pervaded all that is
						in the air, all
					 <pb n='245'/> 
					animals and plants, and also
						the earth itself, as a principle of cohesion.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="140"/>
					<p>The world, they
						say, is one and finite, having a spherical shape, such a shape being
						the most suitable for motion, as Posidonius says in the fifth book
						of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse</hi> and the disciples of
						Antipater in their works on the Cosmos. Outside of the world is
						diffused the infinite void, which is incorporeal. By incorporeal is
						meant that which, though capable of being occupied by body, is not
						so occupied. The world has no empty space within it, but forms one
						united whole. This is a necessary result of the sympathy and tension
						which binds together things in heaven and earth. Chrysippus
						discusses the void in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Void</hi> and in
						the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Sciences</hi> ; so
						too Apollophanes in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, Apollodorus,
						and Posidonius in his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse</hi>, book
						ii. But these, it is added [<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> sympathy and
						tension], are likewise bodies.<note n='a'>The reading <foreign lang='greek'> a)sw/mat a</foreign> can be retained if we alter
							<foreign lang='greek'>tau=ta</foreign> to <foreign lang='greek'>lekta/,</foreign>the sense thus being "the meanings of

							required in &sect; 134. Professor Pearson suggests<foreign lang='greek'>ei)=nai de\ kai\ ta\ a)sw/mat a o(moi/ws,</foreign>introducing

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="141"/>
					<p>Time too is incorporeal, being the measure of the
						world's motion. And time past and time future are infinite, but time
						present is finite. They hold that the world must come to an end,
						inasmuch as it had a beginning, on the analogy of those things which
						are understood by the senses. And that of which the parts are
						perishable is perishable as a whole. Now the parts of the world are
						perishable, seeing that they are transformed one into the other.
						Therefore the world itself is doomed to perish. Moreover, anything
						is destructible if it admits of deterioration ; therefore the world
						is so, for it is first evaporated and again dissolved into
						water.
					</p> <pb n='247'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>
					<p>The world, they hold, comes into being
						when its substance has first been converted from fire through air
						into moisture and then the coarser part of the moisture has
						condensed as earth, while that whose particles are fine has been
						turned into air, and this process of rarefaction goes on increasing
						till it generates fire. Thereupon out of these elements animals and
						plants and all other natural kinds are formed by their mixture. The
						generation and the destruction of the world are discussed by Zeno in
						his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus in the
						first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, by Posidonius in the
						first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Cosmos</hi>, by
						Cleanthes, and by Antipater in his tenth book <hi rend='ital'>On the
							Cosmos.</hi> Panaetius, however, maintained that the world is
						indestructible.
					</p> 
					<p>The doctrine that the world is a living
						being, rational, animate and intelligent, is laid down by Chrysippus
						in the first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On
							Providence</hi>, by Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>,
						and by Posidonius. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="143"/>
						
						It is a living thing in the sense of an animate
						substance endowed with sensation ; for animal is better than
						non-animal, and nothing is better than the world, <hi
							rend='ital'>ergo</hi> the world is a living being. And it is endowed
						with soul, as is clear from our several souls being each a fragment
						of it. Bo&euml;thus, however, denies that the world is a living thing. The
						unity of the world is maintained by Zeno in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus, by Apollodorus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, and by Posidonius in the first book of
						his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> By the totality of
						things, the All, is meant, according to Apollodorus, (1) the world,
						and in another sense (2) the system composed of the world and the
						void outside it. The world then is finite, the void infinite.

					<p>Of the stars some are fixed, and are carried round
						with the whole heaven ; others, the wandering stars or planets, have
						their special motions. The sun travels in an oblique path through
						the zodiac. Similarly the moon travels in a spiral path. The sun is
						pure fire : so Posidonius in the seventh book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena.</hi> And it is larger than the
						earth, as the same author says in the sixth book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> Moreover it is spherical in
						shape like the world itself according to this same author and his
						school. That it is fire is proved by its producing all the effects
						of fire ; that it is larger than the earth by the fact that all the
						earth is illuminated by it ; nay more, the heaven beside. The fact
						too that the earth casts a conical shadow proves that the sun is
						greater than it. And it is because of its great size that it is seen
						from every part of the earth.
					</p> 
					<p>The moon, however, is of a more
						earthy composition, since it is nearer to the earth. These fiery
						bodies and the stars generally derive their nutriment, the sun from
						the wide ocean, being a fiery kindling, though intelligent ; the
						moon from fresh waters, with an admixture of air, close to the earth
						as it is : thus Posidonius in the sixth book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Physics</hi> ; the other heavenly bodies being nourished
						from the earth. They hold that the stars are spherical in shape and
						that the earth too is so and is at rest ; and that the moon does not
						shine by her own light, but by the borrowed light of the sun when he
						shines upon her.
					</p> 
					<p>An eclipse of the sun takes place when the
						moon passes in front of it on the side towards us, as shown by Zeno
						with a diagram in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the Whole.</hi>
						<milestone unit="section" n="146"/>
						
						For the moon is seen approaching at conjunctions and
					</p> <pb
						n='251'/> 
					<p>occulting it and then again receding from it. This can
						best be observed when they are mirrored in a basin of water. The
						moon is eclipsed when she falls into the earth's shadow : for which
						reason it is only at the full moon that an eclipse happens [and not
						always then], although she is in opposition to the sun every month ;
						because the moon moves in an oblique orbit, diverging in latitude
						relatively to the orbit of the sun, and she accordingly goes farther
						to the north or to the south. When, however, the moon's motion in
						latitude has brought her into the sun's path through the zodiac, and
						she thus comes diametrically opposite to the sun, there is an
						eclipse. Now the moon is in latitude right on the zodiac,<note
							n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the moon's latitude relatively to
							the zodiac is nil.</note> when she is in the constellations of
						Cancer, Scorpio, Aries and Taurus : so Posidonius and his followers
						tell us.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="147"/>
					<p>The deity, say they, is a living being, immortal,
						rational, perfect or intelligent in happiness, admitting nothing
						evil [into him], taking providential care of the world and all that
						therein is, but he is not of human shape. He is, however, the
						artificer of the universe and, as it were, the father of all, both
						in general and in that particular part of him which is
						all-pervading, and which is called many names according to its
						various powers. They give the name Dia (<foreign lang='greek'>*di/a</foreign>) because all things are due to (<foreign lang='greek'>dia/</foreign>) him ; Zeus (<foreign lang='greek'>*zh=na</foreign>) in so far as he is the cause of life
						(<foreign lang='greek'>zh=n</foreign>) or pervades all life ; the
						name Athena is given, because the ruling part of the divinity
						extends to the aether ; the name Hera marks its extension to the air
						; he is called Hephaestus since it spreads to the creative fire ;
						Poseidon, since it stretches to the sea ; Demeter, since it reaches
						to the earth. Similarly men have
					 <pb n='253'/> 
					given the
						deity his other titles, fastening, as best they can, on some one or
						other of his peculiar attributes.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="148"/>
					<p>The substance of God is
						declared by Zeno to be the whole world and the heaven, as well as by
						Chrysippus in his first book <hi rend='ital'>Of the Gods</hi>, and
						by Posidonius in his first book with the same title. Again,
						Antipater in the seventh book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the
							Cosmos</hi> says that the substance of God is akin to air, while
						Bo&euml;thus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> speaks of the
						sphere of the fixed stars as the substance of God. Now the term
						Nature is used by them to mean sometimes that which holds the world
						together, sometimes that which causes terrestrial things to spring
						up. Nature is defined as a force moving of itself, producing and
						preserving in being its offspring in accordance with seminal principles<note n='a'>Or perhaps "seminal proportions." This obscure expression would seem intended to assimilate all development and
							evolution to the growth, whether of plants or animals, from
							seed.</note> within definite periods, and effecting results
						homogeneous with their sources. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="149"/>
						
						Nature, they hold, aims both at
						utility and at pleasure, as is clear from the analogy of human
						craftsmanship. That all things happen by fate or destiny is maintained by Chrysippus in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>De fato</hi>,
						by Posidonius in his <hi rend='ital'>De fato</hi>, book ii., by Zeno
						and by Bo&euml;thus in his <hi rend='ital'>De fato</hi>, book i. Fate is
						defined as an endless chain of causation, whereby things are, or as
						the reason or formula by which the world goes on. What is more, they
						say that divination in all its forms is a real and substantial
						fact, if there is really Providence. And they prove it to be
						actually a science on the evidence of certain results : so Zeno,
						Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>De
							divinatione</hi>, Athenodorus, and Posidonius in the second book of
						his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse</hi> and the fifth book of

					<p>The
						primary matter they make the substratum of all things : so
						Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>,
						and Zeno. By matter is meant that out of which anything whatsoever
						is produced. Both substance and matter are terms used in a twofold
						sense according as they signify (1) universal or (2) particular
						substance or matter. The former neither increases nor diminishes,
						while the matter of particular things both increases and diminishes.
						Body according to them is substance which is finite : so Antipater
						in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Substance</hi>, and
						Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics.</hi> Matter can also be
						acted upon, as the same author says, for if it were immutable, the
						things which are produced would never have been produced out of it.
						Hence the further doctrine that matter is divisible <hi
							rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> Chrysippus says that the division is
						not <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, but itself infinite ; for
						there is nothing infinitely small to which the division can extend.
						But nevertheless the division goes on without ceasing.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="151"/>
					<p>Hence,
						again, their explanation of the mixture of two substances is,
						according to Chrysippus in the third book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, that they permeate each other through and
						through, and that the particles of the one do not merely surround
						those of the other or lie beside them. Thus, if a little drop of
						wine be thrown into the sea, it will be equally diffused over the
						whole sea for a while and then will be blended<note n='a'>For the

					<p>Also they hold that there are daemons (<foreign lang='greek'>

						human affairs. They believe too in heroes, that is, the souls of the

						the changes which go on in the air, they describe winter as the
						cooling of the air above the earth due to the sun's departure to a
						distance from the earth ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="152"/>
						
						spring as the right temperature of the air
						consequent upon his approach to us ; summer as the heating of the
						air above the earth when he travels to the north ; while autumn they
						attribute to the receding of the sun from us. As for the winds, they
						are streams of air, differently named<note n='a'>The lacuna of the
							mss. can be filled from the parallel passage of Aetius, Diels, <hi
								rend='ital'>Doxographi Graeci</hi>, p. 374 a 23.</note> according to
						the localities from which they blow. And the cause of their
						production is the sun through the evaporation of the clouds. The
						rainbow is explained as the reflection of the sun's rays from watery
						clouds or, as Posidonius says in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Meteorology</hi>, an image of a segment of the sun or
						moon in a cloud suffused with dew, which is hollow and visible
						without intermission, the image showing itself as if in a mirror in
						the form of a circular arch. Comets, bearded stars, and meteors are
						fires which arise when dense air is carried up to the region of
						aether. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="153"/>
						
						A shooting star is the sudden kindling of a mass of fire in
						rapid motion through the air, which leaves a trail behind it
						presenting an appearance of length. Rain is the transformation of
						cloud into water, when moisture drawn up by the sun from land or sea
						has been only partially evaporated. If this is cooled down, it is
						called hoar-frost. Hail is frozen cloud, crumbled by a wind ; while
						snow is moist matter from a cloud which has congealed : so
						Posidonius in the eighth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> Lightning is a kindling of clouds from being rubbed
						together or being rent by wind, as Zeno says in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi> ; thunder the noise these clouds make
						when they rub against each other or burst. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="154"/>
						
						Thunderbolt is the term
						used when the fire is
					 <pb n='259'/> 
					violently kindled and
						hurled to the ground with great force as the clouds grind against
						each other or are torn by the wind. Others say that it is a
						compression of fiery air descending with great force. A typhoon is a
						great and violent thunderstorm whirlwind-like, or a whirlwind of
						smoke from a cloud that has burst. A "prester" is a cloud rent all
						round by the force of fire and wind. Earthquakes, say they, happen
						when the wind finds its way into, or is imprisoned in, the hollow
						parts of the earth : so Posidonius in his eighth book ; and some of
						them are tremblings, others openings of the earth, others again
						lateral displacements,<note n='a'>For <foreign lang='greek'>

					<p>They maintain that the parts of the world are
						arranged thus. The earth is in the middle answering to a centre ;
						next comes the water, which is shaped like a sphere all round it,
						concentric with the earth, so that the earth is in water. After the
						water comes a spherical layer of air. There are five celestial
						circles : first, the arctic circle, which is always visible ;
						second, the summer tropic ; third, the circle of the equinox ;
						fourth, the winter tropic ; and fifth, the antarctic, which is
						invisible to us. They are called parallel, because they do not
						incline towards one another ; yet they are described round the same
						centre.<note n='b'>The <foreign lang='greek'> ke/ntro n</foreign> is
							rather an axis (namely, a diameter of the celestial sphere) than a
							point.</note> The zodiac is an oblique circle, as it crosses the
						parallel circles. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="156"/>
						
						And there are five terrestrial zones : first, the
						northern zone which is beyond the arctic circle, uninhabitable
						because of the cold ; second, a temperate zone ; a third, uninhabitable because of great heats, called the torrid zone ; fourth,
						a counter-temperate zone ; fifth, the southern zone, uninhabitable
						because of its cold.
					</p> <pb n='261'/> 
					<p>Nature in their view is an
						artistically working fire, going on its way to create ; which is
						equivalent to a fiery, creative, or fashioning breath. And the soul
						is a nature capable of perception. And they regard it as the breath
						of life, congenital with us ; from which they infer first that it is
						a body and secondly that it survives death. Yet it is perishable,
						though the soul of the universe, of which the individual souls of
						animals are parts, is indestructible. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="157"/>
						
						Zeno of Citium and
						Antipater, in their treatises <hi rend='ital'>De anima</hi>, and
						Posidonius define the soul as a warm breath ; for by this we become
						animate and this enables us to move. Cleanthes indeed holds that all
						souls continue to exist until the general conflagration ; but
						Chrysippus says that only the souls of the wise do so.<note

					</p> 
					<p>They count eight parts of
						the soul : the five senses, the generative power in us, our power of
						speech, and that of reasoning. They hold that we see when the light
						between the visual organ and the object stretches in the form of a
						cone : so Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Physics</hi> and Apollodorus. The apex of the cone in
						the air is at the eye, the base at the object seen. Thus the thing
						seen is reported to us by the medium of the air stretching out
						towards it, as if by a stick.
					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="158"/>
					<p>We hear when the air between
						the sonant body and the organ of hearing suffers concussion, a
						vibration which spreads spherically and then forms waves and strikes
						upon the ears, just as the water in a reservoir forms wavy circles
						when a stone is thrown into it. Sleep is caused, they say, by the
						slackening of the tension in our senses, which affects the ruling
						part of
					 <pb n='263'/> 
					the soul. They consider that the
						passions are caused by the variations of the vital breath.
					</p>
					
					<p>Semen is by them defined as that which is capable of generating
						offspring like the parent. And the human semen which is emitted by a
						human parent in a moist vehicle is mingled with parts of the soul,
						blended in the same ratio in which they are present in the parent.
						<milestone unit="section" n="159"/>
						
						Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>
						declares it to be in substance identical with vital breath or
						spirit. This, he thinks, can be seen from the seeds cast into the
						earth, which, if kept till they are old, do not germinate, plainly
						because their fertility has evaporated. Sphaerus and his followers
						also maintain that semen derives its origin from the whole of the
						body ; at all events every part of the body can be reproduced from
						it. That of the female is according to them sterile, being, as
						Sphaerus says, without tension, scanty, and watery. By ruling part
						of the soul is meant that which is most truly soul proper, in which
						arise presentations and impulses and from which issues rational
						speech. And it has its seat in the heart.

						indifference to everything which is neither virtue nor vice ;

					in things
						indifferent, but treating them all alike. The wise man he compared
						to a good actor, who, if called upon to take the part of a Thersites

						wished to discard both Logic and Physics, saying that Physics was
						beyond our reach and Logic did not concern us : all that did concern

					<milestone unit="section" n="161"/>
					<p>Dialectical reasonings, he said, are like
						spiders' webs, which, though they seem to display some artistic
						workmanship, are yet of no use. He would not admit a plurality of
						virtues with Zeno, nor again with the Megarians one single virtue
						called by many names ; but he treated virtue in accordance with the
						category of relative modes. Teaching this sort of philosophy, and
						lecturing in the Cynosarges, he acquired such influence as to be
						called the founder of a sect. At any rate Miltiades and Diphilus
						were denominated Aristoneans. He was a plausible speaker and suited
						the taste of the general public. Hence Timon's verse about him<note

					<p>After meeting Polemo, says Diocles of Magnesia, while Zeno was
						suffering from a protracted illness, he recanted his views. The
						Stoic doctrine to which he attached most importance was the wise
						man's refusal to hold mere opinions. And against this doctrine
						Persaeus was contending when he induced one of a pair of twins to
						deposit a certain sum with Ariston and afterwards got the other to
						reclaim it. Ariston being thus reduced to perplexity was refuted. He
						was at variance with Arcesilaus ; and one day when he saw an
						abortion in the shape of a bull with
					 <pb n='267'/> 
					a uterus,
						he said, "Alas, here Arcesilaus has had given into his hand an
						argument against the evidence of the senses."

					<p>Herillus of Carthage declared the end of action to be Knowledge,

						standard in all things and not to be misled by ignorance. Knowledge
						he defined as a habit of mind, not to be upset by argument, in the
						acceptance of presentations. Sometimes he used to say there was no
						single end of action, but it shifted according to varying
						circumstances and objects, as the same bronze might become a statue
						either of Alexander or of Socrates. He made a distinction between
						end-in-chief and subordinate end : even the unwise may aim at the
						latter, but only the wise seek the true end of life. Everything that
						lies between virtue and vice he pronounced indifferent. His
						writings, though they do not occupy much space, are full of vigour
						and contain some controversial passages in reply to Zeno.

					<p>He was the son of Theophantus and a native of

					<p>At the outset of his career he was fond of

				(331-232 b.c.)</head> 
					<p>Cleanthes, son of Phanias, was a native of
						Assos. This man, says Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions
							of Philosophers</hi>, was at first a pugilist. He arrived in Athens,
						as some people say, with four drachmas only, and meeting with Zeno
						he studied philosophy right nobly and adhered to the same doctrines
						throughout. He was renowned for his industry, being indeed driven by
						extreme poverty to work for a living. Thus, while by night he used
						to draw water in gardens, by day he exercised himself in arguments :
						hence the nickname Phreantles or Welllifter was given him. He is
						said to have been brought into court to answer the inquiry how so
						sturdy a fellow as he made his living, and then to have been
						acquitted on producing as his witnesses the gardener in whose garden
						he drew water 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="169"/>
						
						and the woman who sold the meal which he used to
						crush. The Areopagites were satisfied and voted him a
					</p> <pb
						n='275'/> 
					<p>donation of ten minas, which Zeno forbade him to
						accept. We are also told that Antigonus made him a present of three
						thousand drachmas. Once, as he was conducting some youths to a
						public spectacle, the wind blew his cloak aside and disclosed the
						fact that he wore no shirt, whereupon he was applauded by the
						Athenians, as is stated by Demetrius of Magnesia in his work on <hi
							rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name.</hi> This then also increased the
						admiration felt for him. There is another story that Antigonus when
						attending his lectures inquired of him why he drew water and
						received the reply, "Is drawing water all I do ? What ? Do I not dig
						? What ? Do I not water the garden ? or undertake any other labour
						for the love of philosophy ?" For Zeno used to discipline him to
						this and bid him return him an obol from his wages.<note n='a'>A
							slave allowed by his master to hire himself out to another master

						And one day he
						produced a handful of small coin before his acquaintance and said,
						"Cleanthes could even maintain a second Cleanthes, if he liked,
						whereas those who possess the means to keep themselves yet seek to
						live at the expense of others, and that too though they have plenty
						of time to spare from their studies." Hence Cleanthes was called a
						second Heracles. He had industry, but no natural aptitude for
						physics, and was extraordinarily slow. On which account Timon
						describes him thus<note n='b'>Frag. 41 D.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Who is
						this that like a bell-wether ranges over the ranks of men, a

						alone was strong enough to carry the load of Zeno.

						Once when he was
						reproached with cowardice, he replied, "That is why I so seldom go
						wrong." Again, when extolling his own manner of life above that of
						the wealthy, he used to say that, while they were playing at ball,
						he was at work digging hard and barren ground. He would often find
						fault with himself too, and one day when Ariston heard him doing
						this and asked, "Who is it you are scolding so ?" he, laughing,
						said, "An old man with grey hairs and no wits." To some one who
						declared that Arcesilaus did not do what he ought, his reply was,
						"No more of this ; do not censure him. For if by his words he does
						away with duty, he maintains it at all events by his deeds." And
						Arcesilaus rejoined, "I am not to be won by flattery." Whereupon
						Cleanthes said, "True, but my flattery consists in alleging that
						your theory is incompatible with your practice."

					<milestone unit="section" n="172"/>
					<p>When some

						attitude. At which the audience were so astonished that they
						applauded him and drove Sositheus off the stage. Afterwards when the
						poet apologized for the insult, he accepted the apology, saying
						that, when Dionysus and Heracles were ridiculed by the poets without
						getting angry, it would be absurd for him to be annoyed at casual
						abuse. He used to say that the Peripatetics were in the same case as
						lyres which, although they give forth sweet sounds, never hear
						themselves. It is said that when he laid it down as Zeno's opinion
						that a man's character could be known from his looks, certain witty
						young men brought before him a rake with hands horny from toil in
						the country and requested him to state what the man's character was.
						Cleanthes was perplexed and ordered the man to go away ; but when,

						that I can still write and read, I am content to wait." We are told
						that he wrote down Zeno's lectures on oyster-shells and the

						with a neat answer. "I assented not to the proposition that they are
						pomegranates, but to another, that there are good grounds for
						thinking them to be pomegranates. Certainty of presentation and

				CHRYSIPPUS (c. 282-206 B.C.)</head> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="179"/>
					<p>Chrysippus, the son of
						Apollonius, came either from Soli or from Tarsus, as Alexander
						relates in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions.</hi> He was a pupil of
						Cleanthes. Before this he used to practise as a long-distance runner
						;
					 <pb n='289'/> 
					but afterwards he came to hear Zeno, or, as
						Diocles and most people say, Cleanthes ; and then, while Cleanthes
						was still living, withdrew from his school and attained exceptional
						eminence as a philosopher. He had good natural parts and showed the
						greatest acuteness in every branch of the subject ; so much so that
						he differed on most points from Zeno, and from Cleanthes as well, to
						whom he often used to say that all he wanted was to be told what the
						doctrines were ; he would find out the proofs for himself.
						Nevertheless, whenever he had contended against Cleanthes, he would
						afterwards feel remorse, so that he constantly came out with the
						lines<note n='a'>Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Or.</hi> 540-1.</note> :
					</p>
					
					<p>Blest in all else am I, save only where
					</p> 
					<p>I touch Cleanthes
						: there I am ill-fortuned.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="180"/>
					<p>So renowned was he for dialectic
						that most people thought, if the gods took to dialectic, they would
						adopt no other system than that of Chrysippus. He had abundance of
						matter, but in style he was not successful. In industry he surpassed
						every one, as the list of his writings shows ; for there are more
						than 705 of them. He increased their number by arguing repeatedly on
						the same subject, setting down anything that occurred to him, making
						many corrections and citing numerous authorities. So much so that in
						one of his treatises he copied out nearly the whole of Euripides'
						<hi rend='ital'>Medea</hi>, and some one who had taken up the
						volume, being asked what he was reading, replied, "The <hi
							rend='ital'>Medea</hi> of Chrysippus."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="181"/>
					<p>Apollodorus of Athens
						in his <hi rend='ital'>Collection of Doctrines</hi>, wishing to show
						that what Epicurus wrote with force and originality unaided by
						quotations was far greater in amount than the books of Chrysippus,
						says, to
					 <pb n='291'/> 
					quote his exact words, "If one were to
						strip the books of Chrysippus of all extraneous quotations, his
						pages would be left bare." So much for Apollodorus. Of Chrysippus
						the old woman who sat beside him used to say, according to Diocles,
						that he wrote 500 lines a day. Hecato says that he came to the study
						of philosophy, because the property which he had inherited from
						his father had been confiscated to the king's treasury.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="182"/>
					<p>In
						person he was insignificant, as is shown by the statue in the
						Ceramicus, which is almost hidden by an equestrian statue hard by ;
						and this is why Carneades called him Crypsippus or Horse-hidden.
						Once when somebody reproached him for not going with the multitude
						to hear Ariston, he rejoined, "If I had followed the multitude, I
						should not have studied philosophy." When some dialectician got up
						and attacked Cleanthes, proposing sophistical fallacies to him,
						Chrysippus called to him, "Cease to distract your elder from matters
						of importance ; propound such quibbles to us juniors." Again, when
						somebody who had a question to ask was steadily conversing with him
						in private, and then upon seeing a crowd approaching began to be
						more contentious, he said :
					</p> 
					<p>Ah! brother mine, thine eye is
						growing wild :
					</p> 
					<p>To madness fast thou'rt changing, sane but
						now.<note n='a'>Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Or.</hi> 253.</note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="183"/>
					<p>At
						wine-parties he used to behave quietly, though he was unsteady on
						his legs ; which caused the woman-slave to say, "As for Chrysippus,
						only his legs get tipsy." His opinion of himself was so high that
						when some one inquired, "To whom shall I entrust my son ?" he
						replied, "To me : for, if I had dreamt of there being anyone better
						than
					 <pb n='293'/> 
					myself, I should myself be studying with
						him." Hence, it is said, the application to him of the line<note
							n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> x. 495.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>He alone has
						understanding ; the others flit shadow-like around ;
					</p> 
					<p>and
					</p>
					
					<p><hi rend='center'>But for Chrysippus, there had been no
						Porch.</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>At last, however,--so we are told by Sotion in
						his eighth book,--he joined Arcesilaus and Lacydes and studied
						philosophy under them in the Academy. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="184"/>
						
						And this explains his arguing
						at one time against, and at another in support of, ordinary
						experience, and his use of the method of the Academy when treating
						of magnitudes and numbers.
					</p> 
					<p>On one occasion, as Hermippus
						relates, when he had his school in the Odeum, he was invited by his
						pupils to a sacrificial feast. There after he had taken a draught of
						sweet wine unmixed with water, he was seized with dizziness and
						departed this life five days afterwards, having reached the age of
						seventy-three years, in the 143rd Olympiad.<note n='b'>208-204
							b.c.</note> This is the date given by Apollodorus in his <hi
								rend='ital'>Chronology.</hi> I have toyed with the subject in the
						following verses<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
							706.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Chrysippus turned giddy after gulping down a
						draught of Bacchus ; he spared not the Porch nor his country nor his
						own life, but fared straight to the house of Hades.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="185"/>
					<p>Another
						account is that his death was caused by a violent fit of laughter ;
						for after an ass had eaten up his figs, he cried out to the old
						woman, "Now give the ass a drink of pure wine to wash down the
						figs." And thereupon he laughed so heartily that he died.
					</p> <pb
						n='295'/> 
					<p>He appears to have been a very arrogant man.<note
						n='a'>In &sect;&sect; 185-189; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Wilamowitz,<hi
							rend='ital'>Antig. von K.</hi>pp. 104<hi
								rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note>At any rate, of all his many writings he
						dedicated none to any of the kings. And he was satisfied with one
						old woman's judgement, says Demetrius in his work called <hi
							rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name.</hi> When Ptolemy wrote to
						Cleanthes requesting him to come himself or else to send some one to
						his court, Sphaerus undertook the journey, while Chrysippus declined
						to go. On the other hand, he sent for his sister's sons, Aristocreon
						and Philocrates, and educated them. Demetrius above mentioned is
						also our authority for the statement that Chrysippus was the first
						who ventured to hold a lecture-class in the open air in the
						Lyceum.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="186"/>
					<p>There was another Chrysippus, a native of Cnidus, a
						physician,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> viii. 89-90, and note
							<hi rend='ital'>ad loc.</hi> ; also Pliny, <hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi>
							xxix. 5.</note> to whom Erasistratus says that he was under great
						obligation. And another besides, a son<note n='c'>Or perhaps a
							grandson, as Wilamowitz suggests, <hi rend='ital'>Antig. von
								Kar.</hi> p. 326.</note> of the former, court-physician to Ptolemy,
						who on a false charge was dragged about and castigated with the
						lash. And yet another was a pupil of Erasistratus, and another the
						author of a work on <hi rend='ital'>Agriculture.</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>To
						return to the philosopher. He used to propound arguments such as
						the following : "He who divulges the mysteries to the uninitiated is
						guilty of impiety. Now the hierophant certainly does reveal the
						mysteries to the uninitiated, <hi rend='ital'>ergo</hi> he is guilty
						of impiety."<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supr.</hi> ii.
							101.</note> Or again : "What is not in the city is not in the house
						either : now there is no well in the city, <hi rend='ital'>ergo</hi>
						there is none in the house either." Yet another : "There is a
						certain head, and that head you have not. Now this being so, there
						is a head which you have not, therefore you are without a head."
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="187"/>
						Again : "If anyone is in Megara, he is not in Athens : now there is
						a man in Megara,
					 <pb n='297'/> 
					therefore there is not a man
						in Athens." Again : "If you say something, it passes through your
						lips : now you say wagon, consequently a wagon passes through your
						lips." And further : "If you never lost something, you have it still
						; but you never lost horns, <hi rend='ital'>ergo</hi> you have
						horns." Others attribute this to Eubulides.
					</p> 
					<p>There are people
						who run Chrysippus down as having written much in a tone that is
						gross and indecent. For in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the ancient
							Natural Philosophers</hi> at line 600 or thereabouts he interprets
						the story of Hera and Zeus coarsely, with details which no one would
						soil his lips by repeating. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="188"/>
						
						Indeed, his interpretation of the story
						is condemned as most indecent. He may be commending physical doctrine ; but the language used is more appropriate to street-walkers
						than to deities ; and it is moreover not even mentioned by
						bibliographers, who wrote on the titles of books. What Chrysippus
						makes of it is not to be found in Polemo nor Hypsicrates, no, nor
						even in Antigonus. It is his own invention. Again, in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he permits marriage with mothers and
						daughters and sons. He says the same in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
							Things for their own Sake not Desirable</hi>, right at the outset.
						In the third book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Justice</hi>,
						at about line 1000, he permits eating of the corpses of the dead.
						And in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>On the Means of
							Livelihood</hi>, where he professes to be considering <hi
								rend='ital'>a priori</hi> how the wise man is to get his living,
						occur the words : 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="189"/>
						
						"And yet what reason is there that he should
						provide a living ? For if it be to support life, life itself is
						after all a thing indifferent. If it be for pleasure, pleasure too
						is a thing indifferent. While if it be for virtue, virtue in itself
						is sufficient
					 <pb n='299'/> 
					to constitute happiness. The
						modes of getting a livelihood are also ludicrous, as <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> maintenance by a king ; for he will have to be
						humoured : or by friends ; for friendship will then be purchasable
						for money : or living by wisdom ; for so wisdom will become
						mercenary." These are the objections urged against him.

							enjoyed the instruction of Pherecydes of Syros and of Hermodainas of
							Samos.</note> son of the gem-engraver Mnesarchus, and according to
						Hermippus, a Samian, or, according to Aristoxenus, a Tyrrhenian from
						one of those islands which the Athenians held after clearing them of
						their Tyrrhenian inhabitants. Some indeed say that he was descended
						through Euthyphro, Hippasus and Marmacus from Cleonymus, who was
						exiled from Phlius, and that, as Marmacus lived in Samos, so
						Pythagoras was called a Samian. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
						
						From Samos he went, it is said, to
						Lesbos with an introduction to Pherecydes from his uncle Zo&iuml;lus. He
						had three silver flagons made and took them as presents to each of
						the priests of Egypt. He had brothers, of whom Eunomus was the elder
						and Tyrrhenus the second ; he also had a slave, Zamolxis, who is
						worshipped, so says Herodotus,<note n='b'>iv. 93 <hi
							rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> by the Getans,
					 <pb n='323'/> 
					as
						Cronos. He was a pupil, as already stated, of Pherecydes of Syros,
						after whose death he went to Samos to be the pupil of Hermodamas,
						Creophylus's descendant, a man already advanced in years. While
						still young, so eager was he for knowledge, he left his own country
						and had himself initiated into all the mysteries and rites not only
						of Greece but also of foreign countries. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
						
						Now he was in Egypt when
						Polycrates sent him a letter of introduction to Amasis ; he learnt
						the Egyptian language, so we learn from Antiphon in his book <hi
							rend='ital'>On Men of Outstanding Merit</hi>, and he also
						journeyed among the Chaldaeans and Magi. Then while in Crete he went
						down into the cave of Ida with Epimenides ; he also entered the
						Egyptian sanctuaries,<note n='a'>Compare Clement Alex. <hi

						was told their secret lore concerning the gods. After that he
						returned to Samos to find his country under the tyranny of
						Polycrates ; so he sailed away to Croton in Italy, and there he laid
						down a constitution for the Italian Greeks, and he and his followers
						were held in great estimation ; for, being nearly three hundred in
						number, so well did they govern the state that its constitution was
						in effect a true aristocracy (government by the best).
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<p>This
						is what Heraclides of Pontus tells us he used to say about himself :
						that he had once been Aethalides and was accounted to be Hermes'
						son, and Hermes told him he might choose any gift he liked except
						immortality ; so he asked to retain through life and through death a
						memory of his experiences. Hence in life he could recall everything,
						and when he died he still kept the
					 <pb n='325'/> 
					same
						memories. Afterwards in course of time his soul entered into
						Euphorbus and he was wounded by Menelaus. Now Euphorbus used to say
						that he had once been Aethalides and obtained this gift from Hermes,
						and then he told of the wanderings of his soul, how it migrated
						hither and thither, into how many plants and animals it had come,
						and all that it underwent in Hades, and all that the other souls
						there have to endure. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
						
						When Euphorbus died, his soul passed into
						Hermotimus, and he also, wishing to authenticate the story, went up
						to the temple of Apollo at Branchidae, where he identified the
						shield which Menelaus, on his voyage home from Troy, had dedicated
						to Apollo, so he said : the shield being now so rotten through and
						through that the ivory facing only was left. When Hermotimus died,
						he became Pyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos, and again he remembered
						everything, how he was first Aethalides, then Euphorbus, then
						Hermotimus, and then Pyrrhus. But when Pyrrhus died, he became
						Pythagoras, and still remembered all the facts mentioned.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<p>There are some who insist, absurdly enough, that Pythagoras left
						no writings whatever. At all events Heraclitus, the physicist,<note
							n='a'>Fr. 129 D., 17 B.</note> almost shouts in our ear,
						"Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised inquiry beyond all other
						men, and in this selection of his writings made himself a wisdom of
						his own, showing much learning but poor workmanship." The occasion
						of this remark was the opening words of Pythagoras's treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On Nature</hi>, namely, "Nay, I swear by the air I
						breathe, I swear by the water I drink, I will never suffer censure
						on account of this
					 <pb n='327'/> 
					work." Pythagoras in fact
						wrote three books. <hi rend='ital'>On Education, On
						Statesmanship</hi>, and <hi rend='ital'>On Nature.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
						
						But the book
						which passes as the work of Pythagoras is by Lysis of Tarentum, a
						Pythagorean, who fled to Thebes and taught Epaminondas.<note
							n='a'>&sect;&sect; 6-7 <foreign lang='greek'>e)/nioi me\n kaqhgh same/no u.</foreign>
							Hesychius in Suidas (<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi>), an authority older
							than Schol. Plat. 600 B, proves that this passage is a coherent
							whole. The fragment of Heraclitus (B 129 Diels, 17 Byw.) is
							certainly genuine. There may be, in <foreign lang='greek'> i(stori/
								hn,</foreign> an allusion to the study of mensuration in Egypt. The
							pretended explanation, "he spoke thus because . . ." introduces an
							extract from a work which, like all those attributed to Pythagoras,
							must have been a late forgery.</note> Heraclides, the son of
						Serapion, in his <hi rend='ital'>Epitome of Sotion</hi>, says that
						he also wrote a poem <hi rend='ital'>On the Universe</hi>, and
						secondly the <hi rend='ital'>Sacred Poem</hi> which begins :
					</p>
					
					<p>Young men, come reverence in quietude
					</p> 
					<p>All these my words
						;

					<p>thirdly <hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi>, fourthly <hi

						says that the poem <hi rend='ital'>On the Mysteries</hi> was written
						by Hippasus to defame Pythagoras, and that many others written by
						Aston of Croton were ascribed to Pythagoras. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
						
						Aristoxenus says that
						Pythagoras got most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic
						priestess Themistoclea. According to Ion of Chios in his <hi

						Orpheus.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>F.H.G.</hi> Fr. 12, ii. p. 49.

					</p> 
					<p>Sosicrates in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
						Philosophers</hi> says that, when Leon the tyrant of Phlius asked
						him who he was, he said, "A philosopher,"<note n='c'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> i. 12, whence it would seem that Sosicrates
							used Heraclides of Pontus as his authority for this anecdote.</note>
						and that he compared life to the Great Games, where some went
						to
					 <pb n='329'/> 
					compete for the prize and others went with
						wares to sell, but the best as spectators ; for similarly, in life,
						some grow up with servile natures, greedy for fame and gain, but the
						philosopher seeks for truth. Thus much for this part of the
						subject.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
					<p>The contents in general of the aforesaid three
						treatises of Pythagoras are as follows. He forbids us to pray for
						ourselves, because we do not know what will help us. Drinking he
						calls, in a word, a snare, and he discountenances all excess, saying
						that no one should go beyond due proportion either in drinking or in
						eating. Of sexual indulgence, too, he says, "Keep to the winter for
						sexual pleasures, in summer abstain ; they are less harmful in
						autumn and spring, but they are always harmful and not conducive to
						health." Asked once when a man should consort with a woman, he
						replied, "When you want to lose what strength you have."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
					<p>He
						divides man's life into four quarters thus : "Twenty years a boy,
						twenty years a youth, twenty years a young man, twenty years an old
						man ; and these four periods correspond to the four seasons, the boy
						to spring, the youth to summer, the young man to autumn, and the old
						man to winter," meaning by youth one not yet grown up and by a young
						man a man of mature age. According to Timaeus, he was the first to
						say, "Friends have all things in common" and "Friendship is
						equality" ; indeed, his disciples did put all their possessions into
						one common stock. For five whole years they had to keep silence,
						merely listening to his discourses without seeing him, <note
							n='a'>Because he lectured at night ;<hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi>&sect; 15<foreign lang='greek'> nukter inh\ a)kro/as1
									is.</foreign></note> until they passed an examination, and
						thenceforward they were admitted to his house and allowed to see
						him. They would never
					 <pb n='331'/> 
					use coffins of cypress,
						because the sceptre of Zeus was made from it, so we are informed by
						Hermippus in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Pythagoras.</hi>
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
					<p>Indeed, his bearing is said to have been most dignified, and his
						disciples held the opinion about him that he was Apollo come down
						from the far north. There is a story that once, when he was
						disrobed, his thigh was seen to be of gold ; and when he crossed the
						river Nessus, quite a number of people said they heard it welcome
						him. According to Timaeus in the tenth book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>History</hi>, he remarked that the consorts of men bore
						divine names, being called first Virgins, then Brides, and then
						Mothers.<note n='a'>The allusion is to the Nymphs and the heavenly
							pair, mother and daughter (Demeter and Persephone).</note> He it was
						who brought geometry to perfection, while it was Moeris who first
						discovered the beginnings of the elements of geometry : Anticlides
						in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Alexander</hi><note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Scriptorum Alex. ill. fr.</hi> p. 147.</note> affirms
						this, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
						
						and further that Pythagoras spent most of his time upon the
						arithmetical aspect of geometry ; he also discovered the musical
						intervals on the monochord. Nor did he neglect even medicine. We are
						told by Apollodorus the calculator that he offered a sacrifice of
						oxen on finding that in a right-angled triangle the square on the
						hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right
						angle. And there is an epigram running as follows<note n='c'><hi
							rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 119.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>What time
						Pythagoras that famed figure found,
					</p> 
					<p>For which the noble
						offering he brought.
					</p> 
					<p>He is also said to have been the first
						to diet athletes on meat, trying first with Eurymenes<note n='d'>The
							story of Eurymenes was known to Porphyry, <hi rend='ital'>Vit.
								Pyth.</hi> 18. We can still see how these quotations made by D. L.
							himself from Favorinus disturb the context.</note>-- so we learn
						from Favorinus in the third book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>--whereas in former times they had
					
					<pb n='333'/> 
					trained on dried figs, on butter,<note n='a'>Or
						rather "soft cheese";<hi rend='ital'>cf. supra</hi>,i. &sect; 7,
						note.</note> and even on wheatmeal, as we are told by the same
						Favorinus in the eighth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
						History.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
						
						Some say it was a certain trainer named Pythagoras who
						instituted this diet,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
							Iamblichus, <hi rend='ital'>Vit. Pyth.</hi> 25, and Porphyry, <hi
								rend='ital'>De abstinentia</hi>, i. 26.</note> and not our
						Pythagoras, who forbade even the killing, let alone the eating, of
						animals which share with us the privilege of having a soul. This was
						the excuse put forward ; but his real reason for forbidding animal
						diet was to practise people and accustom them to simplicity of life,
						so that they could live on things easily procurable, spreading their
						tables with uncooked foods and drinking pure water only, for this
						was the way to a healthy body and a keen mind. Of course the only
						altar at which he worshipped was that of Apollo the Giver of Life,
						behind the Altar of Horns at Delos, for thereon were placed flour
						and meal and cakes, without the use of fire, and there was no animal
						victim, as we are told by Aristotle in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Constitution of Delos.</hi>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
					<p>He was the first,
						they say, to declare that the soul, bound now in this creature, now
						in that, thus goes on a round ordained of necessity. He too,
						according to Aristoxenus the musician, was the first to introduce

						especially, when he found his own watchwords adopted by anyone, he
						would immediately take to that man and make a friend of him.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
					<p>The following were his watchwords or precepts : don't stir the

							xoi=nic</foreign> was about a <hi rend='ital'>quart</hi>, in dry

						on the ashes, don't wipe up
					 <pb n='337'/> 
					a mess with a

						highway, don't shake hands too eagerly, don't have swallows under
						your own roof, don't keep birds with hooked claws, don't make water
						on nor stand upon your nail-and hair-trimmings, turn the sharp blade
						away, when you go abroad don't turn round at the frontier.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
					<p>This is what they meant. Don't stir the fire with a knife : don't
						stir the passions or the swelling pride of the great. Don't step
						over the beam of a balance : don't overstep the bounds of equity and
						justice. Don't sit down on your bushel : have the same care of
						to-day and the future, a bushel being the day's ration. By not
						eating your heart he meant not wasting your life in troubles and
						pains. By saying do not turn round when you go abroad, he meant to
						advise those who are departing this life not to set their hearts'
						desire on living nor to be too much attracted by the pleasures of
						this life. The explanations of the rest are similar and would take
						too long to set out.

					<p>Above all, he forbade as food red mullet
						and blacktail, and he enjoined abstinence from the hearts of animals
						and from beans, and sometimes, according to Aristotle, even from
						paunch and gurnard. Some say that he contented himself with just
						some honey or a honeycomb or bread, never touching wine in the
						daytime, and with greens boiled or raw for dainties, and fish but
						rarely. His robe was white and spotless, his quilts of white wool,
						for linen had not yet reached those parts. He was never known to
						over-eat, to behave loosely, or to be drunk. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
						
						He would avoid laughter
						and all pandering to tastes such as in-
					 <pb n='339'/> 
					sulting
						jests and vulgar tales. He would punish neither slave nor free man
						in anger. Admonition he used to call "setting right." He used to
						practise divination by sounds or voices and by auguries, never by
						burnt-offerings, beyond frankincense. The offerings he made were
						always inanimate ; though some say that he would offer cocks,
						sucking goats and porkers, as they are called, but lambs never. However, Aristoxenus has it that he consented to the eating of all
						other animals, and only abstained from ploughing oxen and rams.

					<p>The same authority, as we have seen, asserts that Pythagoras took
						his doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. Hieronymus,
						however, says that, when he had descended into Hades, he saw the
						soul of Hesiod bound fast to a brazen pillar and gibbering, and the
						soul of Homer hung on a tree with serpents writhing about it, this
						being their punishment for what they had said about the gods ; he
						also saw under torture those who would not remain faithful to their
						wives. This, says our authority, is why he was honoured by the
						people of Croton. Aristippus of Cyrene affirms in his work <hi

					<p>He is said to have advised his

						:
					</p> 
					<p>Where did I trespass? What did I achieve?
					</p> 
					<p>And
						unfulfilled what duties did I leave?
					</p> 
					<p>Not to let victims be

						unstained with blood. Not to call the gods to witness, man's duty
						being rather to strive to make his own word carry

					conviction. To honour their elders, on the principle that
						precedence in time gives a greater title to respect ; for as in the
						world sunrise comes before sunset, so in human life the beginning
						before the end, and in all organic life birth precedes death.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
						
						And he
						further bade them to honour gods before demi-gods, heroes before
						men, and first among men their parents ; and so to behave one to
						another as not to make friends into enemies, but to turn enemies
						into friends. To deem nothing their own. To support the law, to wage
						war on lawlessness. Never to kill or injure trees that are not wild,
						nor even any animal that does not injure man. That it is seemly and
						advisable neither to give way to unbridled laughter nor to wear
						sullen looks. To avoid excess of flesh, on a journey to let exertion
						and slackening alternate, to train the memory, in wrath to restrain
						hand and tongue, to respect all divination, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
						
						to sing to the lyre and
						by hymns to show due gratitude to gods and to good men. To abstain
						from beans because they are flatulent and partake most of the breath

						taken, and this again will make our dreams in sleep smooth and
						untroubled.

					<p>Alexander in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
						Philosophers</hi> says that he found in the Pythagorean memoirs the
						following tenets as well.<note n='a'>For the doctrines of
							Pythagoras(&sect;&sect; 25-35) Alexander is taken as D. L.'s authority (see
							Introd. pp. xxvi, xxvii) This indefatigable pedant is known to have

							have possessed this work by Alexander, but he probably had access to
							a public library containing it. In any case he deserves praise for
							the selection. Between Alexander Polyhistor in the first century
							b.c. and the threshold of the third century a.d. there had been an
							enormous increase in neoPythagorean literature, mostly dealing

						The principle of all things is the

					 <pb n='343'/>
					
					undefined dyad or two serves as material substratum to the monad,
						which is cause ; from the monad and the undefined dyad spring
						numbers ; from numbers, points ; from points, lines ; from lines,

						intelligent, spherical, with the earth at its centre, the earth
						itself too being spherical and inhabited round about.

						There are also
						antipodes, and our "down" is their "up." Light and darkness have

						and moist ; and of these, if hot preponderates, we have summer; if
						cold, winter; if dry, spring; if moist, late autumn. If all are in
						equilibrium, we have the best periods of the year, of which the
						freshness of spring constitutes the healthy season, and the decay of
						late autumn the unhealthy. So too, in the day, freshness belongs to
						the morning, and decay to the evening, which is therefore more
						unhealthy. The air about the earth is stagnant and unwholesome, and
						all within it is mortal; but the uppermost air is ever-moved and
						pure and healthy, and all within it is immortal and consequently
						divine. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
						
						The sun, the moon, and the other stars are gods; for, in
						them, there is a preponderance of heat, and heat is the cause of
						life. The moon is illumined by the sun. Gods and men are akin,
						inasmuch as man partakes of heat ; therefore God takes thought for
						man. Fate is the cause of things being thus ordered both as a whole
						and separately. The sun's ray penetrates through the
					</p> <pb
						n='345'/> 
					<p>aether, whether cold or dense--the air they call cold
						aether, and the sea and moisture dense aether --and this ray
						descends even to the depths and for this reason quickens all things.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
						All things live which partake of heat--this is why plants are living
						things --but all have not soul, which is a detached part of aether,
						partly the hot and partly the cold, for it partakes of cold aether
						too. Soul is distinct from life; it is immortal, since that from
						which it is detached is immortal. Living creatures are reproduced
						from one another by germination; there is no such thing as
						spontaneous generation from earth. The germ is a clot of brain
						containing hot vapour within it; and this, when brought to the womb,
						throws out, from the brain, ichor, fluid and blood, whence are
						formed flesh, sinews, bones, hairs, and the whole of the body, while
						soul and sense come from the vapour within.

						First congealing in
						about forty days, it receives form and, according to the ratios of
						"harmony," in seven, nine, or at the most ten, months, the mature
						child is brought forth. It has in it all the relations constituting
						life, and these, forming a continuous series, keep it together
						according to the ratios of harmony, each appearing at regulated
						intervals. Sense generally, and sight in particular, is a certain
						unusually hot vapour. This is why it is said to see through air and
						water, because the hot aether is resisted by the cold; for, if the
						vapour in the eyes had been cold, it would have been dissipated on
						meeting the air, its like. As it is, in certain [lines] he calls the
						eyes the portals of
					 <pb n='347'/> 
					the sun. His conclusion is
						the same with regard to hearing and the other senses.

					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
					<p>The
						soul of man, he says, is divided into three parts, intelligence,
						reason, and passion. Intelligence and passion are possessed by other
						animals as well, but reason by man alone. The seat of the soul
						extends from the heart to the brain; the part of it which is in the
						heart is passion, while the parts located in the brain are reason
						and intelligence. The senses are distillations from these. Reason is
						immortal, all else mortal. The soul draws nourishment from the
						blood; the faculties<note n='a'>The word <foreign lang='greek'>
							lo/gous</foreign> is translated above by "ratios," <hi
								rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> proportionalities. With <foreign lang='greek'>
									a)ne/mou s</foreign> compare the Stoic air-currents.</note> of the
						soul are winds, for they as well as the soul are invisible, just as
						the aether is invisible. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
						
						The veins, arteries, and sinews are the
						bonds of the soul. But when it is strong and settled down into
						itself, reasonings and deeds become its bonds. When cast out upon
						the earth, it wanders in the air like the body. Hermes is the
						steward of souls, and for that reason is called Hermes the Escorter,
						Hermes the Keeper of the Gate, and Hermes of the Underworld, since
						it is he who brings in the souls from their bodies both by land and
						sea ; and the pure are taken into the uppermost region, but the
						impure are not permitted to approach the pure or each other, but are
						bound by the Furies in bonds unbreakable. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
						
						The whole air is full of
						souls which are called genii<note n='b'>The Greek daemons (<foreign lang='greek'> dai/mon es</foreign>) are, according to Hesiod, <hi
								rend='ital'>W. and D.</hi> 121-126, superhuman beings, guardians and

							lived.</note> or heroes; these are they who send men dreams and
						signs of future disease and health, and not to men alone, but to
					
					<pb n='349'/> 
					sheep also and cattle as well; and it is to them
						that purifications and lustrations, all divination, omens and the
						like, have reference. The most momentous thing in human life is the
						art of winning the soul to good or to evil. Blest are the men who
						acquire a good soul; [if it be bad] they can never be at rest, nor
						ever keep the same course two days together.

					<p>Right has the
						force of an oath, and that is why Zeus is called the God of Oaths.
						Virtue is harmony, and so are health and all good and God himself;
						this is why they say that all things are constructed according to
						the laws of harmony. The love of friends is just concord and
						equality. We should not pay equal worship to gods and heroes, but to
						the gods always, with reverent silence, in white robes, and after
						purification, to the heroes only from midday onwards. Purification
						is by cleansing, baptism and lustration, and by keeping clean from
						all deaths and births and all pollution, and abstaining from meat
						and flesh of animals that have died, mullets, gurnards, eggs and
						egg-sprung animals, beans, and the other abstinences prescribed by
						those who perform mystic rites in the temples. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
						
						According to

						Pythagoras counselled abstinence from beans either because they are
						like the genitals, or because they are like the gates of Hades . . .
						as being alone unjointed, or because they are injurious, or because
						they are like the form of the universe, or because they belong to
						oligarchy, since they are used in election by lot. He bade his
						disciples not to pick up fallen crumbs, either in order to accustom
						them not to eat immoderately, or because connected with a person's
						death; nay, even, according to Aristo-

					<p>Another of his precepts was not to
						eat white cocks, as being sacred to the Month and wearing suppliant
						garb--now supplication ranked with things good-- sacred to the Month
						because they announce the time of day ; and again white represents
						the nature of the good, black the nature of evil. Not to touch such
						fish as were sacred; for it is not right that gods and men should be
						allotted the same things, any more than free men and slaves. Not to
						break bread ; for once friends used to meet over one loaf, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
						
						as the
						barbarians do even to this day ; and you should not divide bread
						which brings them together; some give as the explanation of this
						that it has reference to the judgement of the dead in Hades, others
						that bread makes cowards in war, others again that it is from it

						unworthy, for certain it is that, when he entrusted his daughter
						Damo with the custody of his memoirs, he solemnly charged her never
						to give them to anyone outside his house. And, although she could
						have sold the writings for a large sum of money, she would not, but

						For the last of the

						Eurytus of Tarentum.
					</p> 
					<p>There were four men of the name of
						Pythagoras living about the same time and at no great distance from
						one another : (1) of Croton, a man with tyrannical leanings ; (2) of
						Phlius, an athlete, some say a trainer ; (3) of Zacynthus ; (4) our

				<div2 n="2" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 2. EMPEDOCLES
(484-424 B.C.)</head> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
					<p>Empedocles was, according to Hippobotus,
						the son of Meton and grandson of Empedocles, and was a native of
						Agrigentum. This is confirmed by Timaeus in the fifteenth book of
						his <hi rend='ital'>Histories</hi>, and he adds that Empedocles, the
						poet's grandfather, had been a man of distinction. Hermippus also
						agrees with Timaeus. So, too, Heraclides, in his treatise <hi
							rend='ital'>On Diseases</hi>,<note n='a'>v. 67.</note> says that he
						was of an illustrious family, his grandfather having kept
						racehorses. Eratosthenes also in his <hi rend='ital'>Olympic
							Victories</hi> records, on the authority of Aristotle, that the
						father of Meton was a victor in the 71st Olympiad.<note n='b'>496
						b.c.</note> 
									
						<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
						
						The grammarian Apollodorus in his <hi

					</p> 
					<p>He was the son of
						Meton, and Glaucus says he went to Thurii, just then founded.<note
							n='c'>445-444 b.c.</note>
					</p> <pb n='369'/> 
					<p>Then farther on he
						adds :
					</p> 
					<p>Those who relate that, being exiled from his home, he
						went to Syracuse and fought in their ranks against the Athenians
						seem, in my judgement at least, to be completely mistaken. For by
						that time either he was no longer living or in extreme old age,
						which is inconsistent with the story.
					</p> 
					<p>For Aristotle and
						Heraclides both affirm that he died at the age of sixty. The victor
						with the ridinghorse in the 71st Olympiad was
					</p> 
					<p><hi
						rend='center'>This man's namesake and grandfather,</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>so
						that Apollodorus in one and the same passage indicates the date as
						well as the fact.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
					<p>But Satyrus in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Lives</hi> states that Empedocles was the son of
						Exaenetus and himself left a son named Exaenetus, and that in the
						same Olympiad Empedocles himself was victorious in the horse-race
						and his son in wrestling, or, as Heraclides<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> Heraclides Lembus.</note> in his <hi
								rend='ital'>Epitome</hi> has it, in the foot-race. I found<note
									n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Introd. p. xiv.</note> in the <hi
										rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> of Favorinus a statement that
						Empedocles feasted the sacred envoys on a sacrificial ox made of
						honey and barley-meal, and that he had a brother named
						Callicratides. Telauges, the son of Pythagoras, in his letter to
						Philolaus calls Empedocles the son of Archinomus.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>

					<p>My friends, who dwell in the great city

					<p>So much
						for his family.
					</p> 
					<p>Timaeus in the ninth book of his <hi
						rend='ital'>Histories</hi> says he
					 <pb n='371'/> 
					was a pupil
						of Pythagoras, adding that, having been convicted at that time of
						stealing his discourses, he was, like Plato, excluded from taking
						part in the discussions of the school ; and further, that Empedocles himself mentions Pythagoras in the lines<note n='a'>Fr. 129
							D.</note>:
					</p> 
					<p>And there lived among them a man of superhuman
						knowledge, who verily possessed the greatest wealth of wisdom.
					</p>
					
					<p>Others say that it is to Parmenides that he is here
						referring.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
					<p>Neanthes states that down to the time of Philolaus
						and Empedocles all Pythagoreans were admitted to the discussions.
						But when Empedocles himself made them public property by his poem,
						they made a law that they should not be imparted to any poet. He
						says the same thing also happened to Plato, for he too was
						excommunicated. But which of the Pythagoreans it was who had
						Empedocles for a pupil he did not say. For the epistle commonly
						attributed to Telauges and the statement that Empedocles was the
						pupil of both Hippasus and Brontinus he held to be unworthy of
						credence.
					</p> 
					<p>Theophrastus affirms that he was an admirer of
						Parmenides and imitated him in his verses, for Parmenides too had
						published his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> in verse. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
						
						But
						Hermippus's account is that he was an admirer not so much of
						Parmenides as of Xenophanes, with whom in fact he lived and whose
						writing of poetry he imitated, and that his meeting with the
						Pythagoreans was subsequent. Alcidamas tells us in his treatise on
						<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> that Zeno and Empedocles were pupils of
						Parmenides about the same time, that afterwards they left him, and
						that, while Zeno framed his own system, Empedocles became the pupil
						of Anaxagoras and Pythagoras,
					 <pb n='373'/> 
					emulating the
						latter in dignity of life and bearing, and the former in his
						physical investigations.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
					<p>Aristotle in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Sophist</hi> calls Empedocles the inventor of rhetoric
						as Zeno of dialectic. In his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Poets</hi>
						he says that Empedocles was of Homer's school and powerful in
						diction, being great in metaphors and in the use of all other
						poetical devices. He also says that he wrote other poems, in
						particular the invasion of Xerxes and a hymn to Apollo, which a
						sister of his (or, according to Hieronymus, his daughter) afterwards
						burnt. The hymn she destroyed unintentionally, but the poem on the
						Persian war deliberately, because it was unfinished. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
						
						And in general
						terms he says he wrote both tragedies and political discourses. But
						Heraclides, the son of Sarapion, attributes the tragedies to a
						different author. Hieronymus declares that he had come across
						forty-three of these plays, while Neanthes tells us that Empedocles
						wrote these tragedies in his youth, and that he, Neanthes, was
						acquainted with seven of them.
					</p> 
					<p>Satyrus in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that he was also a physician and an
						excellent orator : at all events Gorgias of Leontini, a man
						pre-eminent in oratory and the author of a treatise on the art, had
						been his pupil. Of Gorgias Apollodorus says in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> that he lived to be one hundred and
						nine. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
						
						Satyrus quotes this same Gorgias as saying that he himself was
						present when Empedocles performed magical feats. Nay more : he
						contends that Empedocles in his poems lays claim to this power and
						to much besides when he says<note n='a'>Fr. 111 D.</note>:
					</p> <pb
						n='375'/> 
					<p>And thou shalt learn all the drugs that are a defence
						to ward off ills and old age, since for thee alone shall I accomplish all this. Thou shalt arrest the violence of the unwearied
						winds that arise and sweep the earth, laying waste the cornfields
						with their blasts ; and again, if thou so will, thou shalt call back
						winds in requital. Thou shalt make after the dark rain a seasonable
						drought for men, and again after the summer drought thou shalt cause
						tree-nourishing streams to pour from the sky. Thou shalt bring back
						from Hades a dead man's strength.

					<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
					<p>Timaeus also in the
						eighteenth <note n='a'>According to Beloch this should be the
							twelfth book ; <hi rend='ital'>cf. inf.</hi> &sect; 66.</note>book of his
						<hi rend='ital'>Histories</hi> remarks that Empedocles has been
						admired on many grounds. For instance, when the etesian winds once
						began to blow violently and to damage the crops, he ordered asses to
						be flayed and bags to be made of their skin. These he stretched out
						here and there on the hills and headlands to catch the wind and,
						because this checked the wind, he was called the "wind-stayer."
						Heraclides in his book <hi rend='ital'>On Diseases</hi><note
							n='b'>v. 67.</note> says that he furnished Pausanias with the facts
						about the woman in a trance. This Pausanias, according to Aristippus
						and Satyrus, was his bosom-friend, to whom he dedicated his poem <hi
							rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> thus<note n='c'>Fr. 1 D.</note>:
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
					<p><hi rend='center'>Give ear, Pausanias, thou son of Anchitus the

					</p> 
					<p>Moreover he wrote an epigram upon him<note

					<p>The physician Pausanias, rightly so
						named, son of Anchitus, descendant of Asclepius, was born and bred
						at Gela. Many a wight pining in fell torments did he bring back from
						Persephone's inmost shrine.
					</p> 
					<p>At all events Heraclides
						testifies that the case of
					 <pb n='377'/> 
					the woman in a
						trance was such that for thirty days he kept her body without
						pulsation though she never breathed ; and for that reason Heraclides
						called him not merely a physician but a diviner as well, deriving
						the titles from the following lines also<note n='a'>Fr. 112
							D.</note>:
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
					<p>My friends, who dwell in the grcat city sloping

						desirous of oracles, others suffering from all kinds of diseases,
						desiring to hear a message of healing.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
					<p>Timaeus explains that
						he called Agrigentum great, inasmuch as it had 800,000
						inhabitants.<note n='b'>According to the vulgate, an unknown writer
							Potamilla is the authority cited by Diogenes. Diels, however (<hi

						their luxury, said, "The Agrigentines live delicately as if tomorrow they would die, but they build their houses well as if they
						thought they would live for ever."
					</p> 
					<p>It is said that Cleomenes

						been a champion of freedom and averse to rule of every kind, seeing
						that, as Xanthus relates
					 <pb n='379'/> 
					in his account of him,
						he declined the kingship when it was offered to him, obviously
						because he preferred a frugal life.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
						
						With this Timaeus agrees, at the
						same time giving the reason why Empedocles favoured democracy,
						namely, that, having been invited to dine with one of the
						magistrates, when the dinner had gone on some time and no wine was
						put on the table, though the other guests kept quiet, he, becoming
						indignant, ordered wine to be brought. Then the host confessed that
						he was waiting for the servant of the senate to appear. When he came
						he was made master of the revels, clearly by the arrangement of the
						host, whose design of making himself tyrant was but thinly veiled,
						for he ordered the guests either to drink wine or have it poured
						over their heads. For the time being Empedocles was reduced to
						silence ; the next day he impeached both of them, the host and the
						master of the revels, and secured their condemnation and execution.
						This, then, was the beginning of his political career.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
					<p>Again,
						when Acron the physician asked the council for a site on which to
						build a monument to his father, who had been eminent among
						physicians, Empedocles came forward and forbade it in a speech where
						he enlarged upon equality and in particular put the following
						question : "But what inscription shall we put upon it? Shall it be
						this?
					</p> 
					<p>Acron the eminent physician of Agrigentum, son of
						Acros, is buried beneath the steep eminence of his most eminent

						to Simonides.
					</p> <pb n='381'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
					<p>Subsequently Empedocles broke up
						the assembly of the Thousand three years after it had been set up,
						which proves not only that he was wealthy but that he favoured the
						popular cause. At all events Timaeus in his eleventh and twelfth
						books (for he mentions him more than once) states that he seems to
						have held opposite views when in public life and when writing
						poetry.<note n='a'>This emphasis on the political leanings of
							Empedocles, backed by the authority of Timaeus, looks strange after
							the anecdote, also from Timaeus, of &sect;&sect; 64, 65, nor is it clear that the
							attack on the close oligarchical corporation of the Thousand really
							took place at a later date (<foreign lang='greek'> u(/stero
								n</foreign>). That D. L. is working in two passages of Timaeus, in
							the second of which the first is not pre-supposed, is an obvious
							suggestion.</note> In some passages one may see that he is

					</p> 
					<p>All hail! I go about among you an
						immortal god, no more a mortal, etc.
					</p> 
					<p>At the time when he
						visited Olympia he demanded an excessive deference, so that never
						was anyone so talked about in gatherings of friends as Empedocles.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
					<p>Subsequently, however, when Agrigentum came to regret
						him, the descendants of his personal enemies opposed his return home
						; and this was why he went to Peloponnesus, where he died. Nor did
						Timon let even him alone, but fastens upon him in these words :<note

						of the woman in a trance, how that Empedocles became famous because

						offering a sacrifice close to the field of Peisianax. Some of his
						friends had been invited to the sacrifice, including Pausanias.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
						
						Then, after the feast, the remainder of the company dispersed and
						retired to rest, some under the trees in the adjoining field, others
						wherever they chose, while Empedocles himself remained on the spot
						where he had reclined at table. At daybreak all got up, and he was
						the only one missing. A search was made, and they questioned the
						servants, who said they did not know where he was. Thereupon someone
						said that in the middle of the night he heard an exceedingly loud
						voice calling Empedocles. Then he got up and beheld a light in the
						heavens and a glitter of lamps, but nothing else. His hearers were
						amazed at what had occurred, and Pausanias came down and sent people
						to search for him. But later he bade them take no further trouble,
						for things beyond expectation had happened to him, and it was their
						duty to sacrifice to him since he was now a god.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
					<p>Hermippus
						tells us that Empedocles cured Panthea, a woman of Agrigentum, who
						had been given up by the physicians, and this was why he was

					<p>Diodorus of Ephesus, when writing of
						Anaximander, declares that Empedocles emulated him, displaying
						theatrical arrogance and wearing stately robes. We are told that the
						people of Selinus suffered from pestilence owing to the noisome
						smells from the river hard by, so that the citizens themselves
						perished and their women died in childbirth, that Empedocles
						conceived the plan of bringing two neighbouring rivers to the place
						at his own expense, and that by this admixture he sweetened the
						waters. When in this way the pestilence had been stayed and the
						Selinuntines were feasting on the river bank, Empedocles appeared ;
						and the company rose up and worshipped and prayed to him as to a
						god. It was then to confirm this belief of theirs that he leapt into
						the fire. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
						
						These stories are contradicted by Timaeus, who expressly
						says that he left Sicily for Peloponnesus and never returned at all
						; and this is the reason Timaeus gives for the fact that the manner
						of his death is unknown. He replies to Heraclides, whom he mentions
						by name, in his fourteenth book. Pisianax, he says, was a citizen of
						Syracuse and possessed no land at Agrigentum. Further, if such a
						story had been in circulation, Pausanias would have set up a
						monument to his friend, as to a god, in the form of a statue or
						shrine, for he was a wealthy man. "How came he," adds Timaeus, "to
						leap into the craters, which he had
					 <pb n='387'/> 
					never once
						mentioned though they were not far off ? He must then have died in
						Peloponnesus. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
						
						It is not at all surprising that his tomb is not found
						; the same is true of many other men." After urging some such
						arguments Timaeus goes on to say, "But Heraclides is everywhere just
						such a collector of absurdities, telling us, for instance, that a
						man dropped down to earth from the moon."
					</p> 
					<p>Hippobotus assures
						us that formerly there was in Agrigentum a statue of Empedocles with
						his head covered, and afterwards another with the head uncovered
						in front of the Senate House at Rome, which plainly the Romans had
						removed to that site. For portrait-statues with inscriptions are
						extant even now. Neanthes of Cyzicus, who tells about the
						Pythagoreans, relates that, after the death of Meton, the germs of a
						tyranny began to show themselves, that then it was Empedocles who
						persuaded the Agrigentines to put an end to their factions and
						cultivate equality in politics.

					<p>Moreover, from his abundant
						means he bestowed dowries upon many of the maidens of the city who
						had no dowry. No doubt it was the same means that enabled him to don
						a purple robe and over it a golden girdle, as Favorinus relates in
						his <hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia,</hi> and again slippers of bronze
						and a Delphic laurel-wreath. He had thick hair, and a train of boy
						attendants. He himself was always grave, and kept this gravity of
						demeanour unshaken. In such sort would he appear in public ; when
						the citizens met him, they recognized in this demeanour the stamp,
						as it were, of royalty. But afterwards, as he was going in a
						carriage to Messene to attend some festival, he fell and broke his
						thigh ; this
					 <pb n='389'/>

						his death at the age of seventy-seven. Moreover, his tomb is in

					<p>His doctrines were as follows, that

					<p>Shining Zeus and life-bringing Hera, Aidoneus and

						who provided for his wants. Some even say that he was Theomedon's
						favourite. Having disembarked at Piraeus he went up every day to
						Athens and, when he had attended the Sophists' lectures, returned
						again to the port. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
						
						After spending two months there, he went home

						requested by them to make laws, he scorned the request because the

						He would retire
						to the temple of Artemis and play at knuckle-bones with the boys ;
						and when the Ephesians stood round him and looked on, "Why, you
						rascals," he said, "are you astonished? Is it not better to do this
						than to take part in your civil life ?"
					</p> 
					<p>Finally, he became a
						hater of his kind and wandered on the mountains, and there he
						continued to live, making his diet of grass and herbs. However, when
						this gave him dropsy, he made his way back to the city and put this
						riddle to the physicians, whether they were competent to create a
						drought after heavy rain. They could make nothing of this, whereupon
						he buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp
						humour would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure. But,
						as even this was of no avail, he died at the age of sixty.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<p>There is a piece of my own about him as follows<note n='b'><hi
						rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 127.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Often have I
						wondered how it came about that Heraclitus endured to live in this
						miserable fashion and then to die. For a fell disease flooded his
						body with water, quenched the light in his eyes and brought on
						darkness.
					</p> 
					<p>Hermippus, too, says that he asked the doctors
						whether anyone could by emptying the intestines draw off the
						moisture ; and when they said it was
					 <pb n='413'/>
					
					impossible, he put himself in the sun and bade his servants
						plaster him over with cow-dung. Being thus stretched and prone, he
						died the next day and was buried in the market-place. Neanthes of
						Cyzicus states that, being unable to tear off the dung, he remained
						as he was and, being unrecognizable when so transformed, he was
						devoured by dogs.
					</p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					<p>He was exceptional from his boyhood ; for
						when a youth he used to say that he knew nothing, although when he
						was grown up he claimed that he knew everything. He was nobody's
						pupil, but he declared that he "inquired of himself,"<note n='a'>Fr.
							101 D., 80 B.</note> and learned everything from himself. Some,
						however, had said that he had been a pupil of Xenophanes, as we
						learn from Sotion, who also tells us that Ariston in his book <hi
							rend='ital'>On Heraclitus</hi> declares that he was cured of the
						dropsy and died of another disease. And Hippobotus has the same
						story.
					</p> 
					<p>As to the work which passes as his, it is a continuous treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Nature,</hi> but is divided into
						three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a
						third on theology. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
						
						This book he deposited in the temple of Artemis
						and, according to some, he deliberately made it the more obscure in
						order that none but adepts should approach it, and lest familiarity
						should breed contempt. Of our philosopher Timon<note n='b'>Fr. 43
							D.</note> gives a sketch in these words<note n='c'><hi
								rend='ital'>Cf. Il.</hi> i. 247, 248.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>In their midst
						uprose shrill, cuckoo-like, a mob-reviler, riddling Heraclitus.
					</p>
					
					<p>Theophrastus puts it down to melancholy that some parts of his
						work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley. As
						a proof of his magnanimity Antisthenes in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Successions of</hi>
					 <pb n='415'/> 
					<hi
						rend='ital'>Philosophers</hi> cites the fact that he renounced his
						claim to the kingship in favour of his brother. So great fame did
						his book win that a sect was founded and called the Heracliteans,
						after him.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					<p>Here is a general summary of his doctrines. All
						things are composed of fire, and into fire they are again resolved ;
						further, all things come about by destiny, and existent things are
						brought into harmony by the clash of opposing currents ; again, all
						things are filled with souls and divinities. He has also given an
						account of all the orderly happenings in the universe, and declares
						the sun to be no larger than it appears. Another of his sayings is :
						"Of soul thou shalt never find boundaries, not if thou trackest it
						on every path ; so deep is its cause."<note n='a'>Fr. 45 D., 71
							B.</note> Self-conceit he used to call a falling sickness (epilepsy)
						and eyesight a lying sense.<note n='b'>Fr. 46 D., 132 B.</note>
						Sometimes, however, his utterances are clear and distinct, so that
						even the dullest can easily understand and derive therefrom
						elevation of soul. For brevity and weightiness his exposition is
						incomparable.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					<p>Coming now to his particular tenets, we may
						state them as follows : fire is the element, all things are exchange
						for fire and come into being by rarefaction and condensation<note
							n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 90 D., 22 B.</note> ; but of this
						he gives no clear explanation. All things come into being by
						conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream.
						Further, all that is is limited and forms one world. And it is
						alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed
						cycles to all eternity, and this is determined by destiny. Of the
						opposites that which tends to birth or creation is called war and
						strife, and that which tends to destruction by fire is called
						concord and peace.<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 80 D., 62
							B.</note> Change he called
					 <pb n='417'/> 
					a pathway up and
						down, and this determines the birth of the world.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
					<p>For fire by
						contracting turns into moisture, and this condensing turns into
						water ; water again when congealed turns into earth. This process he
						calls the downward path. Then again earth is liquefied, and thus
						gives rise to water, and from water the rest of the series is
						derived. He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea.
						This process is the upward path. Exhalations arise from earth as
						well as from sea ; those from sea are bright and pure, those from
						earth dark. Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element
						by the others. He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding
						element. He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their
						concavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations
						collect and produce flames. These are the stars. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
						
						The flame of the
						sun is the brightest and the hottest ; the other stars are further
						from the earth and for that reason give it less light and heat. The
						moon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not
						pure. The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and
						keeps a proportionate distance from us. That is why it gives us more
						heat and light. Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls
						are turned upwards ; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the
						bowl turning round in its place little by little. Day and night,
						months, seasons and years, rains and winds and other similar
						phenomena are accounted for by the various exhalations. Thus the
						bright exhalation, set aflame in the hollow orb of the sun, produces
						day, the opposite exhalation when it has
					 <pb n='419'/> 
					got
						the mastery causes night ; the increase of warmth due to the bright
						exhalation produces summer, whereas the preponderance of moisture
						due to the dark exhalation brings about winter. His explanations of
						other phenomena are in harmony with this. He gives no account of the
						nature of the earth, nor even of the bowls. These, then, were his
						opinions.

					<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
					<p>Zeno was a citizen of
						Elea. Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> says that
						he was the son of Teleutagoras by birth, but of Parmenides by
						adoption, while Parmenides was the son of Pyres. Of Zeno and
						Melissus Timon <note n='b'>Fr. 45 D.</note> speaks thus<note

					</p> 
					<p>More skilled than many a one, and
						matched by few.
					</p> 
					<p>Zeno, then, was all through a pupil of
						Parmenides and his bosom friend. He was tall in stature, as Plato
						says in his <hi rend='ital'>Parmenides.</hi><note n='d'>127

								rend='ital'>Sophist,</hi><note n='e'>p. 216 a.</note> [and <hi
									rend='ital'>Phaedrus,]</hi><note n='f'>261 d.</note> and calls him
						the Eleatic Palamedes. Aristotle says that Zeno was the inventor of
						dialectic, as Empedocles was of rhetoric.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
					<p>He was a truly
						noble character both as philosopher and as politician ; at all
						events, his extant books are brimful of intellect. Again, he plotted
						to overthrow Nearchus the tyrant (or, according to others,
						Diomedon) but was arrested : so Heraclides in his epitome of
						Satyrus. On that occasion he was crossexamined as to his
						accomplices and about the arms
					 <pb n='437'/> 
					which he was
						conveying to Lipara ; he denounced all the tyrant's own friends,
						wishing to make him destitute of supporters. Then, saying that he
						had something to tell him about certain people in his private ear,
						he laid hold of it with his teeth and did not let go until stabbed
						to death, meeting the same fate as Aristogiton the tyrannicide.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
					<p>Demetrius in his work on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same
						Name</hi> says that he bit off, not the ear, but the nose. According
						to Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
							Philosophers,</hi> after informing against the tyrant's friends, he
						was asked by the tyrant whether there was anyone else in the plot ;
						whereupon he replied, "Yes, you, the curse of the city!" ; and to
						the bystanders he said, "I marvel at your cowardice, that, for fear
						of any of those things which I am now enduring, you should be the
						tyrant's slaves." And at last he bit off his tongue and spat it at
						him ; and his fellow-citizens were so worked upon that they
						forthwith stoned the tyrant to death.<note n='a'>The heroic death of
							Zeno and his defiance of the tyrant furnished a theme for various
							writers ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend='ital'>Adv.

						most authors nearly agree, but Hermippus says he was cast into a

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
					<p>Of him also I have written as
						follows<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 129.</note>
						:
					</p> 
					<p>You wished, Zeno, and noble was your wish, to slay the
						tyrant and set Elea free from bondage. But you were crushed ; for,
						as all know, the tyrant caught you and beat you in a mortar. But
						what is this that I say? It was your body that he beat, and not
						you.
					</p> 
					<p>In all other respects Zeno was a gallant man ; and in
						particular he despised the great no less than
					 <pb n='439'/>
					
					Heraclitus. For example, his native place, the Phocaean colony,
						once known as Hyele and afterwards as Elea, a city of moderate
						size, skilled in nothing but to rear brave men, he preferred before
						all the splendour of Athens, hardly paying the Athenians a visit,
						but living all his life at home.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
					<p>He was the first to propound
						the argument of the "Achilles," which Favorinus attributes to
						Parmenides, and many other arguments. His views are as follows.
						There are worlds, but there is no empty space. The substance of all
						things came from hot and cold, and dry and moist, which change into
						one another. The generation of man proceeds from earth, and the soul
						is formed by a union of all the foregoing, so blended that no one
						element predominates.
					</p> 
					<p>We are told that once when he was
						reviled he lost his temper, and, in reply to some one who blamed him
						for this, he said, "If when I am abused I pretend that I am not,
						then neither shall I be aware of it if I am praised."<note n='a'>A

					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
					<p>Leucippus was born at Elea, but some say at
						Abdera and others at Miletus. He was a pupil of Zeno. His views were
						these. The sum of things
					 <pb n='441'/> 
					is unlimited, and they
						all change into one another. The All includes the empty as well as
						the full. The worlds are formed when atoms fall into the void and
						are entangled with one another ; and from their motion as they
						increase in bulk arises the substance of the stars. The sun revolves
						in a larger circle round the moon. The earth rides steadily, being
						whirled about the centre ; its shape is like that of a drum.
						Leucippus was the first to set up atoms as first principles. Such is
						a general summary of his views ; on particular points they are as
						follows.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
					<p>He declares the All to be unlimited, as already
						stated ; but of the All part is full and part empty,<note n='a'>By
							the "full" is meant matter, atoms ; by the "empty," space.</note>
						and these he calls elements. Out of them arise the worlds unlimited
						in number and into them they are dissolved. This is how the worlds
						are formed. In a given section many atoms of all manner of shapes
						are carried from the unlimited into the vast empty space. These
						collect together and form a single vortex, in which they jostle
						against each other and, circling round in every possible way,
						separate off, by like atoms joining like. And, the atoms being so
						numerous that they can no longer revolve in equilibrium, the light
						ones pass into the empty space outside, as if they were being
						winnowed ; the remainder keep together and, becoming entangled, go
						on their circuit together, and form a primary spherical system. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
						
						This
						parts off like a shell, enclosing within it atoms of all kinds ;
						and, as these are whirled round by virtue of the resistance of the
						centre, the enclosing shell becomes thinner, the adjacent atoms
						continually combining when they touch the vortex.
					</p> <pb n='443'/>
					
					<p>In this way the earth is formed by portions brought to the centre
						coalescing. And again, even the outer shell grows larger by the
						influx of atoms from outside, and, as it is carried round in the
						vortex, adds to itself whatever atoms it touches. And of these some
						portions are locked together and form a mass, at first damp and
						miry, but, when they have dried and revolve with the universal
						vortex, they afterwards take fire and form the substance of the
						stars.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
					<p>The orbit of the sun is the outermost, that of the
						moon nearest to the earth; the orbits of the other heavenly bodies
						lie between these two. All the stars are set on fire by the speed of
						their motion; the burning of the sun is also helped by the stars;
						the moon is only slightly kindled. The sun and the moon are eclipsed
						[when ..., but the obliquity of the zodiacal circle is due<note
							n='a'>So Diels; but see T. L. Heath, <hi

						south ; the regions of the north are always shrouded in mist, and
						are extremely cold and frozen. Eclipses of the sun are rare ;
						eclipses of the moon constantly occur, and this because their orbits
						are unequal. As the world is born, so, too, it grows, decays and
						perishes, in virtue of some necessity, the nature of which he does
						[not] specify.

				<div2 n="7" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 7. DEMOCRITUS(? 460-357
				B.C.)</head> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
					<p>Democritus was the son of Hegesistratus, though some
						say of Athenocritus, and others again of Damasippus. He was a native
						of Abdera or, according to some, of Miletus. He was a pupil of
						certain Magians and Chaldaeans. For when King
					 <pb n='445'/>
					
					Xerxes was entertained by the father of Democritus he left men in
						charge, as, in fact, is stated by Herodotus<note n='a'>Diels remarks
							that this is a free interpretation of Hdt. vii. 109, viii.
							120.</note>; and from these men, while still a boy, he learned
						theology and astronomy. Afterwards he met Leucippus and, according
						to some, Anaxagoras, being forty years younger than the latter. But
						Favorinus in his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> tells us
						that Democritus, speaking of Anaxagoras, declared that his views on
						the sun and the moon were not original but of great antiquity, and
						that he had simply stolen them. Democritus also pulled to pieces the
						views of Anaxagoras on cosmogony and on mind, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
						
						having a spite against
						him, because Anbaxagoras did not take to him. If this be so, how
						could he have been his pupil, as some suggest ?
					</p> 
					<p>According to
						Demetrius in his book on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi>
						and Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
							Philosophers</hi>, he travelled into Egypt to learn geometry from
						the priests, and he also went into Persia to visit the Chaldaeans as
						well as to the Red Sea. Some say that he associated with the
						Gymnosophists in India and went to Aethiopia. Also that, being the
						third son, he divided the family property. Most authorities will
						have it that he chose the smaller portion, which was in money,
						because he had need of this to pay the cost of travel; besides, his
						brothers were crafty enough to foresee that this would be his
						choice. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
						
						Demetrius estimates his share at over 100 talents, the whole
						of which he spent. His industry, says the same author, was so great
						that he cut off a little room in the garden round the house and shut
						himself up there. One day his father brought an ox to sacrifice and
						tied it there, and he was not aware of it for a considerable
						time,
					 <pb n='447'/> 
					until his father roused him to attend the
						sacrifice and told him about the ox. Demetrius goes on : "It would
						seem that he also went to Athens and was not anxious to be
						recognized, because he despised fame, and that while he knew of
						Socrates, he was not known to Socrates, his words being, `I came to
						Athens and no one knew me.'"
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
					<p>"If the <hi
						rend='ital'>Rivals</hi> be the work of Plato," says Thrasylus,
						"Democritus will be the unnamed character, different from Oenopides
						and Anaxagoras, who makes his appearance when conversation is going
						on with Socrates about philosophy, and to whom Socrates says that
						the philosopher is like the all-round athlete.<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>Rivals</hi>, 132 a-c.</note> And truly Democritus was
						versed in every department of philosophy, for he had trained himself
						both in physics and in ethics, nay more, in mathematics and the
						routine subjects of education, and he was quite an expert in the
						arts." From him we have the saying, "Speech is the shadow of
						action." Demetrius of Phalerum in his <hi rend='ital'>Defence of
							Socrates</hi> affirms that he did not even visit Athens. This is to
						make the larger claim, namely, that he thought that great city
						beneath his notice, because he did not care to win fame from a
						place, but preferred himself to make a place famous.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
					<p>His
						character can also be seen from his writings. "He would seem," says
						Thrasylus, "to have been an admirer of the Pythagoreans. Moreover,
						he mentions Pythagoras himself, praising him in a work of his own
						entitled <hi rend='ital'>Pythagoras.</hi><note n='b'> &sect; 46.</note> He
						seems to have taken all his ideas from him and, if chronology did
						not stand in the way, he might have been thought his pupil." Glaucus
						of Rhegium certainly says that
					 <pb n='449'/> 
					he was taught by
						one of the Pythagoreans, and Glaucus was his contemporary.
						Apollodorus of Cyzicus, again, will have it that he lived with
						Philolaus.
					</p> 
					<p>He would train himself, says Antisthenes, by a
						variety of means to test his sense-impressions by going at times
						into solitude and frequenting tombs. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
						
						The same authority states that,
						when he returned from his travels, he was reduced to a humble mode
						of life because he had exhausted his means ; and, because of his
						poverty, he was supported by his brother Damasus. But his reputation
						rose owing to his having foretold certain future events ; and after
						that the public deemed him worthy of the honour paid to a god.<note
							n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>w(s de\ proeipw/n . . . h)ciw/qh.</foreign>
							This sentence in <hi rend='ital'>oratio recta</hi>, interrupting the
							extract from Antisthenes, finds its counterpart in the stories
							attributing to Democritus the power of forecasting the weather or
							the seasons, on the strength of his scientific attainments. <hi
								rend='ital'>Cf</hi>. Pliny, <hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xviii. 273,
							341, and Clem. Alex. <hi rend='ital'>Strom</hi>. vii. 32.</note>
						There was a law, says Antisthenes, that no one who had squandered
						his patrimony should be buried in his native city. Democritus,
						understanding this, and fearing lest he should be at the mercy of
						any envious or unscrupulous prosecutors, read aloud to the people
						his treatise, the <hi rend='ital'>Great Diacosmos</hi>, the best of
						all his works ; and then he was rewarded with 500 talents ; and,
						more than that, with bronze statues as well ; and when he died, he
						received a public funeral after a lifetime of more than a century.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
						Demetrius, however, says that it was not Democritus himself but his
						relatives who read the <hi rend='ital'>Great Diacosmos</hi>, and
						that the sum awarded was 100 talents only ; with this account
						Hippobotus agrees.
					</p> 
					<p>Aristoxenus in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Historical Notes</hi> affirms that Plato wished to burn
						all the writings of Democritus that he could collect, but that
						Amyclas and Clinias
					 <pb n='451'/> 
					the Pythagoreans prevented
						him, saying that there was no advantage in doing so, for already the
						books were widely circulated. And there is clear evidence for this
						in the fact that Plato, who mentions almost all the early
						philosophers, never once alludes to Democritus, not even where it
						would be necessary to controvert him, obviously because he knew that
						he would have to match himself against the prince of philosophers,
						for whom, to be sure, Timon<note n='a'>Fr. 46 D.</note> has this
						meed of praise<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Il.</hi> i. 263, iv.
							341.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Such is the wise Democritus, the guardian of
						discourse, keen-witted disputant, among the best I ever read.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
					<p>As regards chronology, he was, as he says himself in the <hi
						rend='ital'>Lesser Diacosmos</hi>, a young man when Anaxagoras was
						old, being forty years his junior. He says that the <hi
							rend='ital'>Lesser Diacosmos</hi> was compiled 730 years after the
						capture of Troy. According to Apollodorus in his <hi
							rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> he would thus have been born in the 80th
						Olympiad,<note n='c'>460-457 b.c.</note> but according to Thrasylus
						in his pamphlet entitled <hi rend='ital'>Prolegomena to the Reading
							of the works of Democritus</hi>, in the third year of the 77th
						Olympiad,<note n='d'>470-469 b.c.</note> which makes him, adds
						Thrasylus, one year older than Socrates. He would then be a
						contemporary of Archelaus, the pupil of Anaxagoras, and of the
						school of Oenopides ; indeed he mentions Oenopides. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
						
						Again, he
						alludes to the doctrine of the One held by Parmenides and Zeno, they
						being evidently the persons most talked about in his day ; he also
						mentions Protagoras of Abdera, who, it is admitted, was a
						contemporary of Socrates.
					</p> 
					<p>Athenodorus in the eighth book of
						his <hi rend='ital'>Walks</hi> relates that, when Hippocrates came
						to see him, he ordered
					 <pb n='453'/> 
					milk to be brought, and,
						having inspected it, pronounced it to be the milk of a black
						she-goat which had produced her first kid ; which made Hippocrates
						marvel at the accuracy of his observation. Moreover, Hippocrates
						being accompanied by a maidservant, on the first day Democritus
						greeted her with "Good morning, maiden," but the next day with "Good
						morning, woman," As a matter of fact the girl had been seduced in
						the night.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
					
					<p>Of the death of Democritus the account given by
						Hermippus is as follows. When he was now very old and near his end,
						his sister was vexed that he seemed likely to die during the
						festival of Thesmophoria and she would be prevented from paying
						the fitting worship to the goddess. He bade her be of good cheer and
						ordered hot loaves to be brought to him every day. By applying these
						to his nostrils he contrived to outlive the festival ; and as soon
						as the three festival days were passed he let his life go from him
						without pain, having then, according to Hipparchus, attained his one
						hundred and ninth year.
					</p> 
					<p>In my <hi rend='ital'>Pammetros</hi>
						I have a piece on him as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
							Pal.</hi> vii. 57.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Pray who was so wise, who wrought
						so vast a work as the omniscient Democritus achieved ? When Death
						was near, for three days he kept him in his house and regaled him
						with the steam of hot loaves.
					</p> 
					<p>Such was the life of our
						philosopher.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
					<p>His opinions are these. The first principles of
						the universe are atoms and empty space ; everything else is merely
						thought to exist. The worlds are unlimited ; they come into being
						and perish. Nothing can come into being from that which is not
					
					<pb n='455'/> 
					nor pass away into that which is not. Further, the
						atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along in
						the whole universe in a vortex, and therby generate all composite
						things--fire, water, air, earth ; for even these are conglomerations
						of given atoms. And it is because of their solidity that these atoms
						are impassive and unalterable. The sun and the moon have been
						composed of such smooth and spherical masses [<hi
							rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> atoms], and so also the soul, which is
						identical with reason. We see by virtue of the impact of images upon
						our eyes.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
					<p>All things happen by virtue of necessity, the
						vortex being the cause of the creation of all things, and this he
						calls necessity. The end of action is tranquillity, which is not
						identical with pleasure, as some by a false interpretation have
						understood, but a state in which the soul continues calm and strong,
						undisturbed by any fear or superstition or any other emotion. This
						he calls well-being and many other names. The qualities of things
						exist merely by convention ; in nature there is nothing but atoms
						and void space. These, then, are his opinions.
					</p>

						Thrasylus has made an ordered catalogue, arranging them in fours, as

					<p>Protagoras, son of Artemon or, according to

					<p>He and Prodicus of Ceos gave public

						Favorinus in his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History.</hi>
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
					<p>Protagoras was the first to maintain that there are two sides to
						every question, opposed to each other, and he even argued in this
						fashion, being the first to do so. Furthermore he began a work thus
						: "Man is the measure of all things, of things that are that they
						are, and of things that are not that they
					 <pb n='465'/> 
					are
						not." He used to say that soul was nothing apart from the senses, as
						we learn from Plato in the <hi rend='ital'>Theaetetus</hi>,<note
							n='a'>152 a <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> and that everything is
						true. In another work he began thus : "As to the gods, I have no
						means of knowing either that they exist or that they do not exist.
						For many are the obstacles that impede knowledge, both the obscurity
						of the question and the shortness of human life." 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
						
						For this
						introduction to his book the Athenians expelled him ; and they burnt
						his works in the market-place, after sending round a herald to
						collect them from all who had copies in their possession.
					</p> 
					<p>He
						was the first to exact a fee of a hundred minae and the first to
						distinguish the tenses of verbs, to emphasize the importance of
						seizing the right moment, to institute contests in debating, and to
						teach rival pleaders the tricks of their trade. Furthermore, in
						his dialectic he neglected the meaning in favour of verbal
						quibbling, and he was the father of the whole tribe of eristical
						disputants now so much in evidence ; insomuch that Timon<note
							n='b'>Fr. 47 D.</note> too speaks of him as<note n='c'><hi

					<p>He too first introduced the method of discussion which is called
						Socratic. Again, as we learn from Plato in the <hi

						first to use in discussion the argument of Antisthenes which strives
						to prove that contradiction is impossible, and the first to point
						out how to attack and refute any proposition laid down : so
						Artemidorus the dialectician in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>In
							Reply to Chrysippus.</hi> He too invented the shoulder-pad on which
						porters carry their burdens, so we are told by Aristotle in his
						treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Education</hi> ; for he himself had been
						a porter,

						taken up by Democritus, who saw how skilfully his bundles of wood
						were tied. He was the first to mark off the parts of discourse into
						four, namely, wish, question, answer, command<note n='b'>This
							answers roughly to the optative, the indicative, and the
						imperative.</note> ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
						
						others divide into seven parts, narration,
						question, answer, command, rehearsal, wish, summoning ; these he
						called the basic forms of speech. Alcidamas made discourse fourfold,
						affirmation, negation, question, address.
					</p> 
					<p>The first of his
						books he read in public was that <hi rend='ital'>On the Gods</hi>,
						the introduction to which we quoted above ; he read it at Athens in
						Euripides' house, or, as some say, in Megaclides' ; others again
						make the place the Lyceum and the reader his disciple Archagoras,

					</p> 
					<p>Protagoras, I hear it told of

					</p> 
					<p>The story is told that
						once, when he asked Euathlus his disciple for his fee, the latter
						replied, "But I have not won a case yet." "Nay," said Protagoras,
						"if I win this case against you I must have the fee, for winning it
						; if you win, I must have it, because <hi rend='ital'>you</hi> win
						it."
					</p> 
					<p>There was another Protagoras, an astronomer, for whom

					<note n='c'>We naturally feel surprise when this early philosopher
						is interpolated between Protagoras and Anaxarchus, both assumed to

						reflection on our author's acquaintance with his subject. There was
						a certain Diogenes of Smyrna, an obscure adherent of the school of
						Abdera. D. L., or more probably one of his authorities, has confused
						this Democritean with the earlier and better-known Diogenes of

					</p>
					
					<p>The doctrines of Diogenes were as follows.<note n='b'>Diels (<hi

						was taught by Democritus. Now Anaxarchus accompanied Alexander and
						flourished in the 110th Olympiad.<note n='d'>340-337 b.c.</note> He
						made an enemy of Nicocreon, tyrant of Cyprus. Once at a

						magnificent ; there is only one thing lacking, that the head of some
						satrap should be served up at table." This was a hit at Nicocreon,
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
						who never forgot it, and when after the king's death Anaxarchus was
						forced against his will to land in Cyprus, he seized him and,
						putting him in a mortar, ordered him to be pounded to death with
						iron pestles. But he, making light of the punishment, made that
						well-known speech, "Pound, pound the pouch containing Anaxarchus ;
						ye pound not Anaxarchus." And when Nicocreon commanded his tongue to
						be cut out, they say he bit it off and spat it at him. This is what
						I have written upon him<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi>
							vii. 133.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Pound, Nicocreon, as hard as you like : it
						is but a pouch. Pound on ; Anaxarchus's self long since is housed

					<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
					<p>For his fortitude and contentment
						in life he was called the Happy Man. He had, too, the capacity of
						bringing anyone to reason in the easiest possible way. At all events
						he succeeded in diverting Alexander when he had begun to think
						himself a god ; for, seeing blood running from a wound he had
						sustained, he pointed to him with his finger and said, "See, there

					<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
					<p>Pyrrho of Elis was the son of
						Pleistarchus, as Diocles relates. According to Apollodorus in his
						<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, he was first a painter ; then he
						studied under Stilpo's son Bryson<note n='a'>For "Stilpo's son
							Bryson" Roeper's conjecture <foreign lang='greek'> bru/swn os h)\
								*sti/lpwn os</foreign> (<hi rend='ital'>Philolog.</hi> xxx. 462) would
							substitute "under Bryson or Stilpo." In any case chronology seems to
							forbid the supposition that Pyrrho was a pupil of either Stilpo or
							Bryson.</note>: thus Alexander in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
								Philosophers.</hi> Afterwards he joined Anaxarchus, whom he
						accompanied on his travels everywhere so that he even forgathered
						with the Indian Gymnosophists and with the Magi. This led him to
						adopt a most noble philosophy, to quote Ascanius of Abdera, taking
						the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement. He denied that
						anything was honourable or dishonourable, just or unjust.<note
							n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> a particular act is no more just
							than unjust.</note> And so, universally, he held that there is
						nothing really existent, but custom and convention govern human
						action ; for no single thing is in itself any more this than
						that.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
					<p>He led a life consistent with this doctrine, going out
						of his way for nothing, taking no precaution, but facing all risks
						as they came, whether carts, precipices, dogs or what not, and,
						generally, leaving nothing to the arbitrament of the senses ; but he
						was kept out of harm's way by his friends who, as Antigonus of
						Carystus tells us, used to follow close after him. But Aenesidemus
						says that it was only his philosophy that was based upon suspension
						of judgement, and that he did not lack foresight in his everyday
						acts. He lived to be nearly ninety.
					</p> 
					<p>This is what Antigonus of
						Carystus says of Pyrrho in his book upon him. At first he was a poor
						and unknown painter, and there are still some indifferent
					</p> <pb
						n='477'/> 
					<p>torch-racers of his in the gymnasium at Elis. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
						
						He would
						withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself
						to his relatives ; this he did because he had heard an Indian
						reproach Anaxarchus, telling him that he would never be able to
						teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on
						kings in their courts. He would maintain the same composure at all
						times, so that, even if you left him when he was in the middle of a
						speech, he would finish what he had to say with no audience but
						himself, although in his youth he had been hasty.<note n='a'>Here
							Diels would insert in the text words which would make the meaning
							"easily moved by the applause of the crowd and ambitious of
							fame."</note> Often, our informant adds, he would leave his home
						and, telling no one, would go roaming about with whomsoever he
						chanced to meet. And once, when Anaxarchus fell into a slough, he
						passed by without giving him any help, and, while others blamed him,
						Anaxarchus himself praised his indifference and <hi
							rend='ital'>sang-froid.</hi>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
					<p>On being discovered once talking
						to himself, he answered, when asked the reason, that he was training
						to be good. In debate he was looked down upon by no one, for he
						could both discourse at length and also sustain a cross-examination,
						so that even Nausiphanes when a young man was captivated by him : at
						all events he used to say that we should follow Pyrrho in
						disposition but himself in doctrine ; and he would often remark that
						Epicurus, greatly admiring Pyrrho's way of life, regularly asked him
						for information about Pyrrho ; and that he was so respected by his
						native city that they made him high priest, and on his account they
						voted that all philosophers should be exempt from taxation.
					</p>
					
					<p>Moreover, there were many who emulated his
					 <pb n='479'/>
					
					abstention from affairs, so that Timon in his <hi
						rend='ital'>Pytho</hi><note n='a'>The citation from the <hi

						He

						Eratosthenes in his essay <hi rend='ital'>On Wealth and
							Poverty</hi>, now and then even taking things for sale to market,
						poultry perchance or pigs, and he would dust the things in the
						house, quite indifferent as to what he did. They say he showed his
						indifference by washing a porker. Once he got enraged in his
						sister's cause (her name was Philista), and he told the man who
						blamed him that it was not over a weak woman that one should display
						indifference. When a cur rushed at him and terrified him, he
						answered his critic that it was not easy entirely to strip oneself
						of human weakness ; but one should strive with all one's might
						against facts, by deeds if possible, and if not, in word.

					<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
					<p>They say that, when septic salves and surgical and caustic

					<p>Posidonius, too, relates of

						that such was the unperturbed state in which the wise man should

						had pupils of repute, in particular one Eurylochus, who fell short

						Once in Elis he was so hard pressed by his pupils'

					<p>Philo, again, who had a habit of very often talking

					<p>Besides these, Pyrrho's
						pupils included Hecataeus of Abdera, Timon of Phlius, author of the
						<hi rend='ital'>Silli,</hi> of whom more anon, and also Nausiphanes
						of Teos, said by some to have been a teacher of Epicurus. All these
						were called Pyrrhoneans after the name of their master, but
						Aporetics, Sceptics, Ephectics, and even Zetetics, from their
						principles, if we may call them such--
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
						
						Zetetics or seekers because
						they were ever seeking truth, Sceptics or inquirers because they
						were always looking for a solution and never finding one, Ephectics
						or doubters because of the state of mind which followed their
						inquiry, I mean, suspense of judgement, and finally Aporetics or
						those in perplexity, for not only they but even the dogmatic
						philosophers themselves in their turn were often perplexed.
						Pyrrhoneans, of course, they were called from Pyrrho. Theodosius in
						his <hi rend='ital'>Sceptic Chapters</hi> denies that Scepticism
						should be called Pyrrhonism ; for if the movement of the mind in
						either direction is unattainable by us, we shall never know for
						certain what Pyrrho really intended, and without knowing that, we
						cannot be called Pyrrhoneans. Besides this (he says), there is the
						fact that Pyrrho was not the founder of Scepticism ; nor had he any
						positive tenet ; but a Pyrrhonean is one who in manners and life
						resembles Pyrrho.

					<p>Some call Homer the founder of this school,
						for to the same questions he more than anyone else is
					</p> <pb

					<p>always giving different answers at different times, and
						is never definite or dogmatic about the answer. The maxims of the
						Seven Wise Men, too, they call sceptical ; for instance, "Observe
						the Golden Mean," and "A pledge is a curse at one's elbow," meaning
						that whoever plights his troth steadfastly and trustfully brings a
						curse on his own head. Sceptically minded, again, were Archilochus
						and Euripides, for Archilochus says<note n='a'>Fr. 70 B.</note>
						:

					<p>Man's soul, O Glaucus, son of Leptines,

					<p>Is but as

					<p>The Sceptics, then, were constantly
						engaged<note n='e'><foreign lang='greek'> diete/l oun,</foreign>
							imperfect.</note> in overthrowing the dogmas of all schools, but
						enuntiated none themselves ; and though they would go so far as to
						bring forward and expound the dogmas of the others, they themselves
						laid down nothing definitely, not even the laying down of nothing.
						So much so that they even refuted their laying down of nothing,
						saying, for instance, "We determine nothing," since otherwise they
						would have been betrayed into determining<note n='f'><hi
							rend='ital'>Inf.</hi> &sect; 104.</note>; but we put forward, say they,
						all
					 <pb n='489'/> 
					the theories for the purpose of indicating
						our unprecipitate attitude, precisely as we might have done if we
						had actually assented to them. Thus by the expression "We determine
						nothing" is indicated their state of even balance; which is
						similarly indicated by the other expressions, "Not more (one thing
						than another)," "Every saying has its corresponding opposite," and
						the like. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
						
						But "Not more (one thing than another)" can also be taken
						positively, indicating that two things are alike ; for example, "The
						pirate is no more wicked than the liar." But the Sceptics meant it
						not positively but negatively, as when, in refuting an argument, one
						says, "Neither had more existence, Scylla or the Chimaera." And
						"More so" itself is sometimes comparative, as when we say that
						"Honey is more sweet than grapes" ; sometimes both positive and
						negative, as when we say, "Virtue profits more than it harms," for
						in this phrase we indicate that virtue profits and does not harm.
						<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
						
						But the Sceptics even refute the statement "Not more (one thing than
						another)." For, as forethought is no more existent than
						non-existent, so "Not more (one thing than another)" is no more
						existent than not. Thus, as Timon says in the <hi
							rend='ital'>Pytho</hi>, the statement means just absence of all
						determination and withholding of assent. The other statement, "Every
						saying, etc.,"<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> "Every saying
							has its corresponding opposite" (<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>,
							&sect; 74).</note> equally compels suspension of judgement; when facts
						disagree, but the contradictory statements have exactly the same
						weight, ignorance of the truth is the necessary consequence. But
						even this statement has its corresponding antithesis, so that after
						destroying others it turns round and destroys itself, like a purge
						which drives the substance
					 <pb n='491'/> 
					out and then in its
						turn is itself eliminated and destroyed.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
					<p>This the dogmatists
						answer by saying that they do [not merely] not deny the statement,
						but even plainly assert it. So they were merely using the words as
						servants, as it was not possible not to refute one statement by
						another ; just as we<note n='a'>Here (as in &sect; 104) the writer, whether
							D. L or his source, seems to pose as a Sceptic himself ; <hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Introd. p. xiii.</note> are accustomed to say
						there is no such thing as space, and yet we have no alternative but
						to speak of space for the purpose of argument, though not of
						positive doctrine, and just as we say nothing comes about by
						necessity and yet have to speak of necessity. This was the sort of
						interpretation they used to give ; though things appear to be such
						and such, they are not such in reality but only appear such. And
						they would say that they sought, not thoughts, since thoughts are
						evidently thought, but the things in which sensation plays a
						part.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
					<p>Thus the Pyrrhonean principle, as Aenesidemus says in
						the introduction to his <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrhonics</hi>, is but a
						report on phenomena or on any kind of judgement, a report in which
						all things are brought to bear on one another, and in the comparison
						are found to present much anomaly and confusion. As to the
						contradictions in their doubts, they would first show the ways in
						which things gain credence, and then by the same methods they would
						destroy belief in them ; for they say those things gain credence
						which either the senses are agreed upon or which never or at least
						rarely change, as well as things which become habitual or are
						determined by law and those which please or excite wonder. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
						
						They
						showed, then, on the basis of that which is contrary to what induces
						belief, that the probabilities on both sides are equal.
					</p> <pb
						n='493'/> 
					<p>Perplexities arise from the agreements<note n='a'>If,
						however, with Reiske we here read <foreign lang='greek'>th=s</foreign> for <foreign lang='greek'>ta\s,</foreign>
						the meaning is: "The objections urged <hi rend='ital'>against</hi>
						the (supposed) consistency of our percepts or our concepts, were
						arranged by them under ten modes."</note> between appearances or
						judgements, and these perplexities they distinguished under ten
						different modes in which the subjects in question appeared to vary.
						The following are the ten modes laid down.<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi>i.
							&sect;&sect; 36-163.</note>
					</p> 
					<p>The <hi rend='ital'>first</hi> mode relates to
						the differences between living creatures in respect of those things
						which give them pleasure or pain, or are useful or harmful to them.
						By this it is inferred that they do not receive the same impressions
						from the same things, with the result that such a conflict
						necessarily leads to suspension of judgement. For some creatures
						multiply without intercourse, for example, creatures that live in
						fire, the Arabian phoenix and worms ; others by union, such as man
						and the rest. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
						
						Some are distinguished in one way, some in another,
						and for this reason they differ in their senses also, hawks for
						instance being most keen-sighted, and dogs having a most acute sense
						of smell. It is natural that if the senses, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> eyes, of animals differ, so also will the
						impressions produced upon them; so to the goat vine-shoots are good
						to eat, to man they are bitter ; the quail thrives on hemlock, which
						is fatal to man ; the pig will eat ordure, the horse will not.
					</p>
					
					<p>The <hi rend='ital'>second</hi> mode has reference to the natures
						and idiosyncrasies of men; for instance, Demophon, Alexander's
						butler, used to get warm in the shade and shiver in the sun. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
						
						Andron
						of Argos is reported by Aristotle<note n='c'>Fr. 103 Rose.</note> to
						have travelled across the waterless deserts of Libya without
						drinking. Moreover, one man fancies the profession of medicine,
						another
					 <pb n='495'/> 
					farming, and another commerce; and the
						same ways of life are injurious to one man but beneficial to
						another; from which it follows that judgement must be suspended.
					</p>
					
					<p>The <hi rend='ital'>third</hi> mode depends on the differences
						between the sense-channels in different cases, for an apple gives
						the impression of being pale yellow in colour to the sight, sweet in
						taste and fragrant in smell. An object of the same shape is made to
						appear different by differences in the mirrors reflecting it. Thus
						it follows that what appears is no more such and such a thing than
						something different.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
					<p>The <hi rend='ital'>fourth</hi> mode is
						that due to differences of condition and to changes in general ; for
						instance, health, illness, sleep, waking, joy, sorrow, youth, old
						age, courage, fear, want, fullness, hate, love, heat, cold, to say
						nothing of breathing freely and having the passages obstructed. The
						impressions received thus appear to vary according to the nature of
						the conditions. Nay, even the state of madmen is not contrary to
						nature; for why should their state be so more than ours? Even to our
						view the sun has the appearance of standing still. And Theon of
						Tithorea used to go to bed and walk in his sleep, while Pericles'
						slave did the same on the housetop.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
					<p>The <hi
						rend='ital'>fifth</hi> mode is derived from customs, laws, belief in
						myths, compacts between nations and dogmatic assumptions. This class
						includes considerations with regard to things beautiful and ugly,
						true and false, good and bad, with regard to the gods, and with
						regard to the coming into being and the passing away of the world of
						phenomena. Obviously the same thing is regarded by some as just and
						by others as unjust, or as good by some and
					 <pb n='497'/> 
					bad
						by others. Persians think it not unnatural for a man to marry his
						daughter; to Greeks it is unlawful. The Massagetae, acording to
						Eudoxus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Voyage round the
							World</hi>, have their wives in common ; the Greeks have not. The
						Cilicians used to delight in piracy ; not so the Greeks. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
						
						Different
						people believe in different gods ; some in providence, others not.
						In burying their dead, the Egyptians embalm them; the Romans burn
						them ; the Paeonians throw them into lakes. As to what is true,
						then, let suspension of judgement be our practice.
					</p> 
					<p>The <hi
						rend='ital'>sixth</hi> mode relates to mixtures and participations, by virtue of which nothing appears pure in and by itself, but
						only in combination with air, light, moisture, solidity, heat, cold,
						movement, exhalations and other forces. For purple shows different
						tints in sunlight, moonlight, and lamplight ; and our own
						complexion does not appear the same at noon and when the sun is low.
						<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
						Again, a rock which in air takes two men to lift is easily moved
						about in water, either because, being in reality heavy, it is lifted
						by the water or because, being light, it is made heavy by the air.
						Of its own inherent property we know nothing, any more than of the
						constituent oils in an ointment.
					</p> 
					<p>The <hi
						rend='ital'>seventh</hi> mode has reference to distances, positions,
						places and the occupants of the places. In this mode things which
						are thought to be large appear small, square things round ; flat
						things appear to have projections, straight things to be bent, and
						colourless coloured. So the sun, on account of its distance, appears
						small, mountains when far away appear misty and smooth, but when
						near at hand
					 <pb n='499'/> 
					rugged. 
					
						<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
					
					Furthermore, the sun at
						its rising has a certain appearance, but has a dissimilar appearance
						when in mid-heaven, and the same body one appearance in a wood and
						another in open country. The image again varies according to the
						position of the object, and a dove's neck according to the way it is
						turned. Since, then, it is not possible to observe these things
						apart from places and positions, their real nature is
						unknowable.
					</p> 
					<p>The <hi rend='ital'>eighth</hi> mode is concerned
						with quantities and qualities of things, say heat or cold, swiftness
						or slowness, colourlessness or variety of colours. Thus wine taken
						in moderation strengthens the body, but too much of it is weakening
						; and so with food and other things.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
					<p>The <hi
						rend='ital'>ninth</hi> mode has to do with perpetuity, strangeness, or rarity. Thus earthquakes are no surprise to those among
						whom they constantly take place ; nor is the sun, for it is seen
						every day.<note n='a'>As contrasted, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>, with
							a comet; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh.
								Hyp.</hi> i. 141.</note> This ninth mode is put eighth by Favorinus
						and tenth by Sextus and Aenesidemus; moreover the tenth is put
						eighth by Sextus and ninth by Favorinus.
					</p> 
					<p>The <hi
						rend='ital'>tenth</hi> mode rests on inter-relation, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> between light and heavy, strong and weak,
						greater and less, up and down. Thus that which is on the right is
						not so by nature, but is so understood in virtue of its position
						with respect to something else ; for, if that change its position,
						the thing is no longer on the right. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
						
						Similarly father and brother
						are relative terms, day is relative to the sun, and all things
						relative to our mind. Thus relative terms are in and by themselves
						unknowable. These, then, are the ten modes of perplexity.
					</p> <pb
						n='501'/> 
					<p>But Agrippa and his school add to them<note n='a'>Sext.
						Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> i. 37 <foreign lang='greek'>
							o)/gdoos o( a)po\ tou= pro/s ti.</foreign> The intention of Agrippa was to
						<hi rend='ital'>replace</hi> the ten modes by his five.</note> five
						other modes, resulting respectively from disagreement, extension
						<hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, relativity, hypothesis and
						reciprocal inference. The mode arising from disagreement proves,
						with regard to any inquiry whether in philosophy or in everyday
						life, that it is full of the utmost contentiousness and confusion.
						The mode which involves extension <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>
						refuses to admit that what is sought to be proved is firmly
						established, because one thing furnishes the ground for belief in
						another, and so on <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
						
						The mode
						derived from relativity declares that a thing can never be
						apprehended in and by itself, but only in connexion with something
						else. Hence all things are unknowable. The mode resulting from
						hypothesis arises when people suppose that you must take the most
						elementary of things as of themselves entitled to credence, instead
						of postulating them : which is useless, because some one else will
						adopt the contrary hypothesis. The mode arising from reciprocal
						inference is found whenever that which should be confirmatory of the
						thing requiring to be proved itself has to borrow credit from the
						latter, as, for example, if anyone seeking to establish the
						existence of pores on the ground that emanations take place should
						take this (the existence of pores) as proof that there are
						emanations.<note n='b'>This is what is commonly called arguing in a
							circle.</note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
					<p>They would deny all demonstration, criterion,
						sign, cause, motion, the process of learning, coming into being, or
						that there is anything good or bad by nature. For all demonstration,
						say they, is constructed out of things either already proved or
						indemonstrable. If out of things already proved, those things too
						will require some demonstration,
					 <pb n='503'/> 
					and so on <hi
						rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi> ; if out of things indemonstrable,
						then, whether all or some or only a single one of the steps are the
						subject of doubt, the whole is indemonstrable.<note n='a'>Compare
							Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> ii. 185. "The dogmatists
							assert that the sceptical arguments against demonstration are either
							demonstrative or non-demonstrative. If the latter, they fail to
							establish their point [namely, that there is no such thing as
							demonstration] ; if the former, the Sceptics by assuming
							demonstration confute themselves."</note> If you think, they add,
						that there are some things which need no demonstration, yours must
						be a rare intellect, not to see that you must first have
						demonstration of the very fact that the things you refer to carry
						conviction in themselves. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
						
						Nor must we prove that the elements are
						four from the fact that the elements are four. Besides, if we
						discredit particular demonstrations, we cannot accept the
						generalization from them. And in order that we may know that an
						argument constitutes a demonstration, we require a criterion ; but
						again, in order that we may know that it is a criterion we require a
						demonstration ; hence both the one and the other are
						incomprehensible, since each is referred to the other. How then are
						we to grasp the things which are uncertain, seeing that we know no
						demonstration ? For what we wish to ascertain is not whether
						things appear to be such and such, but whether they are so in their
						essence.
					</p> 
					<p>They declared the dogmatic philosophers to be fools,
						observing that what is concluded <hi rend='ital'>ex hypothesi</hi>
						is properly described not as inquiry but assumption, and by
						reasoning of this kind one may even argue for impossibilities. As
						for those who think that 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
						
						we should not judge of truth from
						surrounding circumstances or legislate on the basis of what is
						found in nature, these men, they used to say, made themselves the
						measure of all things, and did not see that every phenomenon appears
						in a certain disposition and in a certain reciprocal relation to
						surrounding circumstances. Therefore we must affirm either that
						all
					 <pb n='505'/> 
					things are true or that all things are
						false. For if certain things only are true [and others are false],
						how are we to distinguish them ?  Not by the senses, where things in
						the field of sense are in question, since all these things appear to
						sense to be on an equal footing; nor by the mind, for the same
						reason. Yet apart from these faculties there is no other, so far as
						we can see, to help us to a judgement. Whoever therefore, they say,
						would be firmly assured about anything sensible or intelligible must
						first establish the received opinions about it ; for some have
						refuted one doctrine, others another. But things must be judged
						either by the sensible or by the intelligible, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
						
						and both are
						disputed. Therefore it is impossible to pronounce judgement on
						opinions about sensibles or intelligibles ; and if the conflict in
						our thoughts compels us to disbelieve every one, the standard or
						measure, by which it is held that all things are exactly determined,
						will be destroyed, and we must deem every statement of equal value.
						Further, say they, our partner in an inquiry into a phenomenon is
						either to be trusted or not. If he is, he will have nothing to reply
						to the man to whom it appears to be the opposite<note n='a'><hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be not a serpent, but a coil of
							rope.</note> ; for just as our friend who describes what appears to
						him is to be trusted, so is his opponent. If he is not to be
						trusted, he will actually be disbelieved when he describes what
						appears to him.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
					<p>We must not assume that what convinces us is
						actually true. For the same thing does not convince every one, nor
						even the same people always. Persuasiveness sometimes depends on
						external circumstances, on the reputation of the speaker,
					</p> <pb
						n='507'/> 
					<p>on his ability as a thinker or his artfulness, on the
						familiarity or the pleasantness of the topic.
					</p> 
					<p>Again, they
						would destroy the criterion by reasoning of this kind. Even the
						criterion has either been critically determined or not. If it has
						not, it is definitely untrustworthy, and in its purpose of
						distinguishing is no more true than false. If it has, it will belong
						to the class of particular judgements, so that one and the same
						thing determines and is determined, and the criterion which has
						determined will have to be determined by another, that other by
						another, and so on <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
						
						In addition to
						this there is disagreement as to the criterion, some holding that
						man is the criterion, while for some it is the senses, for others
						reason, for others the apprehensive presentation. Now man disagrees
						with man and with himself, as is shown by differences of laws and
						customs. The senses deceive, and reason says different things.
						Finally, the apprehensive presentation is judged by the mind, and
						the mind itself changes in various ways. Hence the criterion is
						unknowable, and consequently truth also.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
					<p>They deny, too, that
						there is such a thing as a sign. If there is, they say, it must
						either be sensible or intelligible. Now it is not sensible, because
						what is sensible is a common attribute, whereas a sign is a
						particular thing. Again, the sensible is one of the things which
						exist by way of difference, while the sign belongs to the category
						of relative. Nor is a sign an object of thought, for objects of
						thought are of four kinds, apparent judgements on things apparent,
						non-apparent judgements on things nonapparent, non-apparent on
						apparent, or apparent on non-apparent ; and a sign is none of these,
						so
					 <pb n='509'/> 
					that there is no such thing as a sign. A
						sign is not "apparent on apparent," for what is apparent needs no
						sign ; nor is it non-apparent on non-apparent, for what is revealed
						by something must needs appear ; nor is it non-apparent on apparent,
						for that which is to afford the means of apprehending something
						else must itself be apparent ;
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
						
						nor, lastly, is it apparent on
						non-apparent, because the sign, being relative, must be apprehended
						along with that of which it is the sign, which is not here the case.
						It follows that nothing uncertain can be apprehended ; for it is
						through signs that uncertain things are said to be apprehended.<note
							n='a'>This conclusion would debar us from all extension of knowledge

					<p>Causes, too, they
						destroy in this way. A cause is something relative ; for it is
						relative to what can be caused, namely, the effect. But things which
						are relative are merely objects of thought and have no substantial
						existence. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
						
						Therefore a cause can only be an object of thought ;
						inasmuch as, if it be a cause, it must bring with it that of which
						it is said to be the cause, otherwise it will not be a cause. Just
						as a father, in the absence of that in relation to which he is
						called father, will not be a father, so too with a cause. But that
						in relation to which the cause is thought of, namely the effect, is
						not present ; for there is no coming into being or passing away or
						any other process : therefore there is no such thing as cause.
						Furthermore, if there is a cause, either bodies are the cause of
						bodies, or things incorporeal of things incorporeal ; but neither is
						the case ; therefore there is no such thing as cause. Body in fact
						could not be the cause of body, inasmuch as both have the same
						nature. And if either is
					 <pb n='511'/> 
					called a cause in so
						far as it is a body, the other, being a body, will become a cause.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
						But if both be alike causes, there will be nothing to be acted upon
						Nor can an incorporeal thing be the cause of an incorporeal thing,
						for the same reason. And a thing incorporeal cannot be the cause of
						a body, since nothing incorporeal creates anything corporeal. And,
						lastly, a body cannot be the cause of anything incorporeal, because
						what is produced must be of the material operated upon ; but if it
						is not operated upon because it is incorporeal, it cannot be
						produced by anything whatever. Therefore there is no such thing as a
						cause. A corollary to this is their statement that the first
						principles of the universe have no real existence ; for in that case
						something must have been there to create and act.
					</p> 
					<p>Furthermore
						there is no motion ; for that which moves moves either in the place
						where it is or in a place where it is not. But it cannot move in the
						place where it is, still less in any place where it is not.
						Therefore there is no such thing as motion.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
					<p>They used also to
						deny the possibility of learning. If anything is taught, they say,
						either the existent is taught through its existence or the
						non-existent through its non-existence. But the existent is not
						taught through its existence, for the nature of existing things is
						apparent to and recognized by all ; nor is the non-existent taught
						through the nonexistent, for with the non-existent nothing is ever
						done, so that it cannot be taught to anyone.
					</p> 
					<p>Nor, say they,
						is there any coming into being. For that which is does not come into
						being, since it <hi rend='ital'>is</hi> ; nor yet that which is not,
						for it has no sub-
					 <pb n='513'/> 
					stantial existence, and that
						which is neither substantial nor existent cannot have had the
						chance of coming into being either.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
					<p>There is nothing good or
						bad by nature, for if there is anything good or bad by nature, it
						must be good or bad for all persons alike, just as snow is cold to
						all. But there is no good or bad which is such to all persons in
						common ; therefore there is no such thing as good or bad by nature.
						For either all that is thought good by anyone whatever must be
						called good, or not all. Certainly all cannot be so called ; since
						one and the same thing is thought good by one person and bad by
						another ; for instance, Epicurus thought pleasure good and
						Antisthenes thought it bad ; thus on our supposition it will follow
						that the same thing is both good and bad. But if we say that not all
						that anyone thinks good is good, we shall have to judge the
						different opinions ; and this is impossible because of the equal
						validity of opposing arguments. Therefore the good by nature is
						unknowable.

					<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
					<p>The whole of their mode of inference can be
						gathered from their extant treatises. Pyrrho himself, indeed, left
						no writings, but his associates Timon, Aenesidemus, Numenius and
						Nausiphanes did ; and others as well.
					</p> 
					<p>The dogmatists answer
						them by declaring that the Sceptics themselves do apprehend and
						dogmatize; for when they are thought to be refuting their hardest
						they do apprehend, for at the very same time they are asseverating
						and dogmatizing. Thus even when they declare that they determine
						nothing, and that to every argument there is an opposite argument,
						they are actually determining these very points and
						dogmatizing.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
						
						<note n='a'>&sect; 77.</note>The others reply, "We
					</p> <pb
						n='515'/> 
					<p>confess to human weaknesses ; for we recognize that it
						is day and that we are alive, and many other apparent facts in life
						; but with regard to the things about which our opponents argue so
						positively, claiming to have definitely apprehended them, we suspend
						our judgement because they are not certain, and confine knowledge to
						our impressions.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> all we know is
							that we feel. <hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> ii.&sect; 92.</note> For we
						admit that we see, and we recognize that we think this or that, but

						that a certain thing appears white, but we are not positive that it
						really is white. As to our `We determine nothing' and the like,<note
							n='b'>&sect; 74.</note> we use the expressions in an undogmatic sense, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
						
						for
						they are not like the assertion that the world is spherical. Indeed
						the latter statement is not certain, but the others are mere
						admissions. Thus in saying `We determine nothing,' we are <hi
							rend='ital'>not</hi> determining even that."
					</p> 
					<p>Again, the
						dogmatic philosophers maintain that the Sceptics do away with life
						itself, in that they reject all that life consists in. The others
						say this is false, for they do not deny that we see ; they only say
						that they do not know how we see. "We admit the apparent fact," say
						they, "without admitting that it really is what it appears to be."
						We also perceive that fire burns ; as to whether it is its nature to
						burn, we suspend our judgement. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
						
						We see that a man moves, and that he
						perishes ; how it happens we do not know. We merely object to
						accepting the unknown substance behind phenomena. When we say a
						picture has projections, we are describing what is apparent ; but if
						we say that it has no projections, we are then speaking, not of what
						is apparent, but of something else. This is
					 <pb n='517'/>
					
					what makes Timon say in his <hi rend='ital'>Python</hi> that he
						has not gone outside what is customary. And again in the <hi
							rend='ital'>Conceits</hi> he says<note n='a'>Fr. 69 D.</note> :
					</p>
					
					<p><hi rend='center'>But the apparent is omnipotent wherever it goes
						;</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>and in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Senses,</hi> "I
						do not lay it down that honey is sweet, but I admit that it appears
						to be so."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
					
					<p>Aenesidemus too in the first book of his <hi
						rend='ital'>Pyrrhonean Discourses</hi> says that Pyrrho determines
						nothing dogmatically, because of the possibility of contradiction,
						but guides himself by apparent facts. Aenesidemus says the same in
						his works <hi rend='ital'>Against Wisdom</hi> and <hi rend='ital'>On
							Inquiry.</hi> Furthermore Zeuxis, the friend of Aenesidemus, in his
						work <hi rend='ital'>On Two-sided Arguments,</hi> Antiochus of
						Laodicea, and Apellas in his <hi rend='ital'>Agrippa</hi> all hold
						to phenomena alone. Therefore the apparent is the Sceptic's
						criterion, as indeed Aenesidemus says ; and so does Epicurus. Democritus, however, denied that any apparent fact could be a criterion,
						indeed he denied the very existence of the apparent. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
						
						Against this
						criterion of appearances the dogmatic philosophers urge that, when
						the same appearances produce in us different impressions, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> a round or square tower, the Sceptic, unless
						he gives the preference to one or other, will be unable to take any
						course ; if on the other hand, say they, he follows either view, he
						is then no longer allowing equal value to all apparent facts. The
						Sceptics reply that, when different impressions are produced, they
						must both be said to appear<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the
							one has as much right to be called an appearance as the
							other.</note> ; for things which are apparent are so called because
						they appear. The end to be realized they hold to be suspension of
						judgement, which brings with it
					 <pb n='519'/> 
					tranquillity
						like its shadow : so Timon and Aenesidemus declare. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
						
						For in matters
						which are for us to decide we shall neither choose this nor shrink
						from that ; and things which are not for us to decide but happen of
						necessity, such as hunger, thirst and pain, we cannot escape,<note

						if ordered to do so, the Sceptic replies that he will be able so to
						live as to suspend his judgement in cases where it is a question of
						arriving at the truth, but not in matters of life and the taking of
						precautions. Accordingly we may choose a thing or shrink from a
						thing by habit and may observe rules and customs. According to some

						calls the Stoics <foreign lang='greek'>oi h(me/ter oi,</foreign> just
						as Cicero calls the Academics "nostri." Even if we accept this

						<foreign lang='greek'>o( par' h(mw=n</foreign> from a monograph of a
						Sceptic ? Something may be urged on either side ; for reasons given
						in Introd. p. xiii, the former conjecture seems somewhat more
						probable.</note> Apollonides of Nicaea in the first book of his
						commentaries <hi rend='ital'>On the Silli</hi>, which he dedicated
						to Tiberius Caesar, was the son of Timarchus and a native of Phlius.
						Losing his parents when young, he became a stage-dancer, but
						later
					 <pb n='521'/> 
					took a dislike to that pursuit and went
						abroad to Megara to stay with Stilpo ; then after some time he
						returned home and married. After that he went to Pyrrho at Elis with
						his wife, and lived there until his children were born ; the elder
						of these he called Xanthus, taught him medicine, and made him his
						heir. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
						
						This son was a man of high repute, as we learn from Sotion in
						his eleventh book. Timon, however, found himself without means of
						support and sailed to the Hellespont and Propontis. Living now at
						Chalcedon as a sophist, he increased his reputation still further
						and, having made his fortune, went to Athens, where he lived until
						his death, except for a short period which he spent at Thebes. He
						was known to King Antigonus and to Ptolemy Philadelphus, as his
						own iambics<note n='a'>Possibly the proem of the <hi
							rend='ital'>Silli.</hi></note> testify.
					</p> 
					<p>He was, according to
						Antigonus, fond of wine, and in the time that he could spare from
						philosophy he used to write poems. These included epics, tragedies,
						satyric dramas, thirty comedies and sixty tragedies, besides <hi
							rend='ital'>silli</hi> (lampoons) and obscene poems. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
						
						There are also
						reputed works of his extending to twenty thousand verses which are
						mentioned by Antigonus of Carystus, who also wrote his life. There
						are three <hi rend='ital'>silli</hi> in which, from his point of
						view as a Sceptic, he abuses every one and lampoons the dogmatic
						philosophers, using the form of parody. In the first he speaks in
						the first person throughout, the second and third are in the form of
						dialogues ; for he represents himself as questioning Xenophanes of
						Colophon about each philosopher in turn, while Xenophanes answers
						him ; in the second he speaks of the more ancient philosophers, in
						the third of the
					 <pb n='523'/> 
					later, which is why some have
						entitled it the Epilogue. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>
						
						The first deals with the same subjects,
						except that the poem is a monologue. It begins as follows<note
							n='a'>Fr. 1 D.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p><hi rend='center'>Ye sophists, ye
						inquisitives, come ! follow !</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>He died at the age of
						nearly ninety, so we learn from Antigonus and from Sotion in his
						eleventh book. I have heard that he had only one eye ; indeed he
						used to call himself a Cyclops. There was another Timon, the
						misanthrope.<note n='b'>Diels regards the passage from <foreign lang='greek'>kai\ e)/ph,</foreign>&sect; 110, down to <foreign lang='greek'>*ti/mwn o( misa/nq rwpos,</foreign>&sect; 112, as an insertion,
							disturbing the symmetry of the materials derived from Antigonus of
							Carystus.</note>
					</p> 
					<p>Now this philosopher, according to
						Antigonus, was very fond of gardens and preferred to mind his own
						affairs. At all events there is a story that Hieronymus the
						Peripatetic said of him, "Just as with the Scythians those who are
						in flight shoot as well as those who pursue, so, among philosophers,
						some catch their disciples by pursuing them, some by fleeing from
						them, as for instance Timon."
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>
					<p>He was quick to perceive
						anything and to turn up his nose in scorn ; he was fond of writing
						and at all times good at sketching plots for poets and collaborating in dramas. He used to give the dramatists Alexander and Homer
						materials for their tragedies.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>
							he collaborated with these two tragic poets, Alexander the
							Aetolian and Homer of Byzantinum, partly by furnishing them with
							plots, partly by handing over scenes from unpublished plays of his
							own, or other similar material.</note> When disturbed by
						maidservants and dogs, he would stop writing, his earnest desire
						being to maintain tranquillity. Aratus is said to have asked him
						how he could obtain a trustworthy text of Homer, to which he
						replied, "You can, if you get hold of the ancient copies, and not
						the corrected copies of our day." He used to let his own poems lie
						about, sometimes
					 <pb n='525'/> 
					half eaten away. 
					
						<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
					
					Hence, when
						he came to read parts of them to Zopyrus the orator, he would turn
						over the pages and recite whatever came handy ; then, when he was
						half through, he would discover the piece which he had been looking
						for in vain, so careless was he.<note n='a'>Similar carelessness is
							recorded of Lamartine.</note> Furthermore, he was so easy-going that
						he would readily go without his dinner. They say that once, when he
						saw Arcesilaus passing through the "knaves-market," he said, "What
						business have you to come here, where we are all free men ?" He was
						constantly in the habit of quoting, to those who would admit the
						evidence of the senses when confirmed by the judgement of the
						mind, the line--

					<p><hi rend='center'>Birds of a feather flock

							partridge and woodcock may be meant, not any Mr. Partridge and Mr.
							Woodcock.</note></hi>
					</p> 
					<p>Jesting in this fashion was habitual
						with him. When a man marvelled at everything, he said, "Why do you
						not marvel that we three have but four eyes between us ?" for in
						fact he himself had only one eye, as also had his disciple
						Dioscurides, while the man whom he addressed was normal. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
						
						Asked once
						by Arcesilaus why he had come there from Thebes, he replied, "Why,
						to laugh when I have you all in full view !" Yet, while attacking
						Arcesilaus in his <hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi>, he has praised him in
						his work entitled the <hi rend='ital'>Funeral Banquet of
							Arcesilaus.</hi>
					</p> 
					<p>According to Menodotus he left no successor,
						but his school lapsed until Ptolemy of Cyrene re-established it.
						Hippobotus and Sotion, however, say that he had as pupils
						Dioscurides of Cyprus, Nicolochus of Rhodes, Euphranor of Seleucia,
						and Pra&yuml;lus of the

						It is added that he corresponded

							rend='ital'>Tusc. Disp.</hi> iii. 41. The last words have been taken
						to refer especially to the pleasures afforded by music and again by
						painting and the plastic arts. But perhaps Epicurus is merely citing
						typical examples of intense pleasures under the heads of the four
						senses : (i.) taste ; (ii.) touch ; (iii.) hearing ; (iv.) seeing.
						The omission of pleasant odours is curious ; <hi
							rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend='ital'>Phil.</hi> 51 e <foreign lang='greek'>qei=on ge/nos h(donw=n.</foreign></note> : "I know not how
						to conceive the good, apart from the pleasures of taste, sexual
						pleasures, the pleasures of sound and the pleasures of beautiful
						form." And in his letter to Pythocles : "Hoist all sail, my dear
						boy, and steer clear of all culture." Epictetus calls him preacher
						of effeminacy and showers abuse on him.
					</p> 
					<p>Again there was
						Timocrates, the brother of Metrodorus, who was his disciple and then
						left the school. He in the book entitled <hi
							rend='ital'>Merriment</hi> asserts that Epicurus vomited twice a day
						from over-indulgence, and goes on to say that he himself had much
						ado to escape from those notorious midnight philosophizings and
						the confraternity with all its secrets ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
						
						further, that Epicurus's
						acquaintance with philosophy was small and his acquaintance with
						life even smaller ; that his bodily health was pitiful,<note
							n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Aelian, Fr. 39 (<hi rend='ital'>De
								Epicuro eiusque discipulis</hi>). According to him the three
							brothers of Epicurus were all victims of disease. Plutarch (<hi
								rend='ital'>Non posse suaviter</hi>, etc., 1097 e) mentions the
							dropsy. However much his ailments were exaggerated by his enemies,
							they do not seem to have hindered him from literary work.</note> so
						much so that for many years he was unable to rise from his chair ;
						and that he spent a whole mina daily on his table, as he himself
						says in his letter to Leontion and in that to the philosophers at
						Mitylene. Also that among other courtesans who consorted with him
						and Metrodorus were Mammarion and Hedia and Erotion and Nikidion. He
						alleges too that in his thirtyseven books <hi rend='ital'>On
							Nature</hi> Epicurus uses much repetition and writes largely in
						sheer opposition to others,
					 <pb n='537'/> 
					especially to
						Nausiphanes, and here are his own words : "Nay, let them go hang :
						for, when labouring with an idea, he too had the sophist's off-hand

						in his letters says of Nausiphanes : "This so maddened him that he

					<p>went over to Carneades, being perhaps burdened by his

						deference to others to such excess that he did not even enter public

						who also says
						that he purchased the garden for eighty minae ; and to the same

						speaks of them as living a very simple and frugal life ; at all
						events they were content with half a pint of thin wine and were, for
						the rest, thoroughgoing water-drinkers. He further says that
						Epicurus did not think it right that their property should be held
						in common, as required by the maxim of
					 <pb n='541'/>
					
					Pythagoras about the goods of friends ; such a practice in his
						opinion implied mistrust, and without confidence there is no
						friendship. In his correspondence he himself mentions that he was
						content with plain bread and water. And again : "Send me a little
						pot of cheese, that, when I like, I may fare sumptuously." Such was
						the man who laid down that pleasure was the end of life. And here is
						the epigram<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iv.

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>

					</p> 
					<p>And, as we go on, we shall know this better from
						his doctrines and his sayings.
					</p> 
					<p>Among the early philosophers,
						says Diocles, his favourite was Anaxagoras, although he occasionally
						disagreed with him, and Archelaus the teacher of Socrates. Diocles
						adds that he used to train his friends in committing his treatises
						to memory.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra</hi>, &sect;&sect; 36,

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
					<p>Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>
						tells us that our philosopher was a pupil of Nausiphanes and Praxiphanes<note n='d'>If this Praxiphanes was the pupil of Theophrastus,
							considerations of age would make it highly improbable that he
							could have taught Epicurus ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Usener, Fr.
							123.</note> ; but in his letter to Eurylochus, Epicurus himself
						denies it and says that he was self-taught. Both Epicurus and
						Hermarchus deny the very existence of Leucippus the philosopher,
						though by some and by Apollodorus the Epicurean he is said to have
						been the teacher of Democritus. Demetrius the Magnesian affirms that
						Epicurus also attended the lectures of Xenocrates.
					</p> <pb n='543'/>
					
					<p>The terms he used for things were the ordinary terms, and
						Aristophanes the grammarian credits him with a very characteristic
						style. He was so lucid a writer that in the work <hi rend='ital'>On
						Rhetoric</hi> he makes clearness the sole requisite. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
						
						And in his
						correspondence he replaces the usual greeting, "I wish you joy," by

					<p>Ariston<note n='a'>This is no doubt the Academic
						philosopher, Ariston of Alexandria, pupil of Antiochus, criticized
						by Philodemus in his Rhetoric, <hi rend='ital'>V.H.</hi><hi

						to study philosophy when he was twelve years old, and started his
						own school at thirty-two.
					</p> 
					<p>He was born, according to
						Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, in the third

						seventh year after the death of Plato.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
						
						When he was thirty-two he
						founded a school of philosophy, first in Mitylene and Lampsacus, and
						then five years later removed to Athens, where he died in the second
						year of the 127th Olympiad,<note n='e'>271-270 b.c.</note> in the
						archonship of Pytharatus, at the age of seventy-two ; and Hermarchus
						the son of Agemortus, a Mitylenaean, took over the School. Epicurus
						died of renal calculus after an illness which lasted a fortnight :
						so Hermarchus tells us in his letters. Hermippus relates that he
						entered a bronze bath of lukewarm water and asked for unmixed
						wine,
					 <pb n='545'/> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
					which he swallowed, and then, having
						bidden his friends remember his doctrines, breathed his last.
					</p>
					
					<p>Here is something of my own about him<note n='a'><hi
						rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 106.</note> :
					</p> 
					<p>Farewell, my
						friends ; the truths I taught hold fast :
					</p> 
					<p>Thus Epicurus
						spake, and breathed his last.
					</p> 
					<p>He sat in a warm bath and neat

					</p> 
					<p>And straightway found chill death in that same
						draught.
					</p> 
					<p>Such was the life of the sage and such his end.
					</p>
					
					<p>His last will was as follows : "On this wise I give and bequeath
						all my property to Amynomachus, son of Philocrates of Bate and
						Timocrates, son of Demetrius of Potamus, to each severally according
						to the items of the deed of gift laid up in the Metro&ouml;n,

						on condition
						that they shall place the garden and all that pertains to it at the

						successors, to live and study in.<note n='b'><hi

						entrust to my School in perpetuity the task of aiding Amynomachus
						and Timocrates and their heirs to preserve to the best of their
						power the common life in the garden in whatever way is best, and
						that these also (the heirs of the trustees) may help to maintain the
						garden in the same way as those to whom our successors in the School
						may bequeath it. And let Amynomachus and Timocrates permit
						Hermarchus and his fellow-members to live in the house in Melite for
						the lifetime of Hermarchus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
					<p>"And from the revenues made over

						approval of Hermarchus. Let them provide for Nicanor as I have

						of his memoir. He died, we learn, seven years before Epicurus in his
						fiftythird year, and Epicurus himself in his will already cited
						clearly speaks of him as departed, and enjoins upon his executors to
						make provision for Metrodorus's children. The above-mentioned

					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>

						will also set down his <hi

						seems worth citing, that you may be in a position to study the

					</p> 
					<p>The first
						epistle is addressed to Herodotus and deals with physics ; the
						second to Pythocles and deals with astronomy or meteorology ; the
						third is addressed to Menoeceus and its subject is human life. We
						must begin with the first after some few preliminary remarks<note
							n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>&sect;&sect; 29-34, the first of those summaries
							of doctrine which take up so much of Book X.</note> upon his
						division of philosophy.
					</p> 
					<p>It is divided into three
						parts--Canonic, Physics, Ethics. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
						
						Canonic forms the introduction to
						the system and is contained in a single work entitled <hi
							rend='ital'>The Canon.</hi> The physical part includes the entire
						theory of Nature : it is contained in the thirty-seven books <hi
							rend='ital'>Of Nature</hi> and, in a summary form, in the letters.
						The ethical part deals with the facts of choice and aversion : this
						may be found in the books <hi rend='ital'>On Human Life</hi>, in the
						letters, and in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>Of the End.</hi> The
						usual arrangement, however, is to conjoin canonic with physics, and
						the former they call the science which deals with the standard and
						the first principle, or the elementary part of philosophy, while
						physics proper, they say, deals with becoming and perishing and with
						nature ; ethics, on the other
					 <pb n='561'/> 
					hand, deals with
						things to be sought and avoided, with human life and with the
						end-in-chief.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
					<p>They reject dialectic as superfluous ; holding
						that in their inquiries the physicists should be content to employ
						the ordinary terms for things.<note n='a'>An opinion often
							emphasized : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>&sect;&sect; 37, 73, 82, 152. <hi
								rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. iii. 931 <hi
									rend='ital'>sqq.</hi></note>Now in <hi rend='ital'>The Canon</hi>
						Epicurus affirms that our sensations and preconceptions and our
						feelings are the standards of truth ; the Epicureans generally make
						perceptions of mental presentations<note n='b'>Such mental pictures
							are caused by atoms too fine to affect sense : <hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi>&sect; 64<hi rend='ital'>infra</hi>; Lucr. ii. 740 <hi
									rend='ital'>sqq.</hi>, iv. 722 <hi rend='ital'>sqq.</hi> ; Cic. <hi
										rend='ital'>N.D.</hi> i. 54. On the whole subject consult Usener's
							<hi rend='ital'>Epicurea</hi>, Fr. 242-265, and, more especially,
							Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi> vii. 203-216.</note> to
						be also standards. His own statements are also to be found in the
						<hi rend='ital'>Summary</hi> addressed to Herodotus and in the <hi
							rend='ital'>Sovran Maxims.</hi> Every sensation, he says, is devoid
						of reason and incapable of memory ; for neither is it self-caused
						nor, regarded as having an external cause, can it add anything
						thereto or take anything therefrom. Nor is there anything which can
						refute sensations or convict them of error : 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
						
						one sensation cannot
						convict another and kindred sensation, for they are equally valid ;
						nor can one sensation refute another which is not kindred but
						heterogeneous, for the objects which the two senses judge are not
						the same<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. inf.</hi>&sect; 146.</note>; nor
						again can reason refute them, for reason is wholly dependent on
						sensation ; nor can one sense refute another, since we pay equal
						heed to all. And the reality of separate perceptions guarantees<note
							n='d'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the trustworthiness of the senses
							(<foreign lang='greek'> ai)sqh/s ewn</foreign>) considered as
							faculties of sense-perception : <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Sext. Emp.
							<hi rend='ital'>Adv math.</hi> viii. 9 (Usener, Fr. 244).</note> the
						truth of our senses. But seeing and hearing are just as real as
						feeling pain. Hence it is from plain facts that we must start when
						we draw inferences about the unknown.<note n='e'>More precisely
							<foreign lang='greek'> a)/dhlon</foreign> =that which does not come
							within the range of sense. Compare <hi
								rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>&sect; 38<foreign lang='greek'>to\ prosme/n on kai\ to\
									a)/dhlon,</foreign> and the way in which the conception of void is
							obtained in &sect; 40. In &sect; 62 it is called<foreign lang='greek'>to\ prosdoc
								azo/men on peri\ tou= a)ora/to u.</foreign></note> For all our notions
						are derived from
					 <pb n='563'/> 
					perceptions, either by actual
						contact or by analogy, or resemblance, or composition, with some
						slight aid from reasoning. And the objects presented to madmen<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi
							rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi> viii. 63.</note> and to people in dreams
						are true, for they produce effects--<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>
						movements in the mind--which that which is unreal never does.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
					<p>By preconception they mean a sort of apprehension or a right
						opinion or notion, or universal idea stored in the mind ; that is, a
						recollection of an external object often presented, <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Such and such a thing is a man : for no sooner
						is the word "man" uttered than we think of his shape by an act of
						preconception, in which the senses take the lead.<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> in conformity with the sense-data which
							precede the recognition.</note> Thus the object primarily denoted by
						every term is then plain and clear. And we should never have started
						an investigation, unless we had known what it was that we were in
						search of. For example : The object standing yonder is a horse or a
						cow. Before making this judgement, we must at some time or other
						have known by preconception the shape of a horse or a cow. We should
						not have given anything a name, if we had not first learnt its form
						by way of preconception. It follows, then, that preconceptions are
						clear. The object of a judgement is derived from something
						previously clear, by reference to which we frame the proposition,
						<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "How do we know that this is a man?"
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
						Opinion they also call conception or assumption, and declare it to
						be true and false<note n='c'>See &sect; 124, where a true <foreign lang='greek'> pro/lhyi s</foreign>is opposed to a false<foreign lang='greek'> u(po/lhyi s.</foreign> In Aristotle <foreign lang='greek'> u(po/lhyi s</foreign> is often a synonym of <foreign lang='greek'>do/ca :</foreign> <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Bonitz, <hi

					<p>They affirm that there are two states of feeling, pleasure and

						every occasion they may be able to aid themselves on the most
						important points, so far as they take up the study of Physics. Those
						who have made some advance in the survey of the entire system
						ought to fix in their minds under the principal headings an
					</p> <pb
						n='567'/> 
					<p>elementary outline of the whole treatment of the
						subject. For a comprehensive view is often required, the details but
						seldom.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
					<p>"To the former, then--the main heads--we must
						continually return, and must memorize them so far as to get a valid
						conception of the facts, as well as the means of discovering all the
						details exactly when once the general outlines are rightly
						understood and remembered ; since it is the privilege of the mature
						student to make a ready use of his conceptions by referring every
						one of them to elementary facts and simple terms. For it is
						impossible to gather up the results of continuous diligent study of
						the entirety of things, unless we can embrace in short formulas and
						hold in mind all that might have been accurately expressed even to
						the minutest detail.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
					<p>"Hence, since such a course is of
						service to all who take up natural science, I, who devote to the
						subject my continuous energy and reap the calm enjoyment of a life
						like this, have prepared for you just such an epitome and manual of
						the doctrines as a whole.
					</p> 
					<p>"In the first place, Herodotus, you
						must understand what it is that words denote, in order that by
						reference to this we may be in a position to test opinions,
						inquiries, or problems, so that our proofs may not run on untested
						<hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, nor the terms we use be empty of
						meaning. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
						
						For the primary signification of every term employed must
						be clearly seen, and ought to need no proving<note n='a'>Epicurus
							explains this more fully in Fr. 258 (Usener, p. 189). For "proof"
							and "proving" Bignone substitutes "declaration" and
							"declare."</note>; this being necessary, if we are to have something
						to which the point at issue or the problem or the opinion before us
						can be referred.
					</p> <pb n='569'/> 
					<p>"Next, we must by all means
						stick to our sensations, that is, simply to the present impressions
						whether of the mind or of any criterion whatever, and similarly to
						our actual feelings, in order that we may have the means of
						determining that which needs confirmation and that which is
						obscure.
					</p> 
					<p>"When this is clearly understood, it is time to
						consider generally things which are obscure. To begin with, nothing
						comes into being out of what is non-existent.<note n='a'>This is no
							innovation of Epicurus but a tenet common to all the pre-Socratics :
							the One, or Nature as a whole, assumed by the Ionians, is
							unchangeable in respect of generation and destruction ; <hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Aristotle, <hi rend='ital'>Met.</hi> i. 3. 984
							a 31. The pluralists were naturally even more explicit : see the
							wellknown fragments, Anax. 17 d, Emped. 8 d. Lucretius (i. 180 f.)
							expands the doctrine.</note> For in that case anything would have
						arisen out of anything, standing as it would in no need of its
						proper germs.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>&sect;&sect; 41, 54. Lucr. i.
						125 f. is the best commentary.</note> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
						
						And if that which disappears
						had been destroyed and become non-existent, everything would have
						perished, that into which the things were dissolved being
						non-existent. Moreover, the sum total of things was always such as
						it is now, and such it will ever remain. For there is nothing into
						which it can change. For outside the sum of things there is nothing
						which could enter into it and bring about the change.
					</p>
					
					<p>"Further [<hi rend='ital'>this he says also in the Larger Epitome
						near the beginning and in his First Book "On Nature"</hi>], the
						whole of being consists of bodies and space.<note n='c'>Usener's
							insertion of "bodies and space" comes from &sect; 86;<hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi>Diels,<hi rend='ital'>Dox. Gr.</hi> 581.
							28.</note> For the existence of bodies is everywhere attested by
						sense itself, and it is upon sensation that reason must rely when it
						attempts to infer the unknown from the known. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
						
						And if there were no
						space (which we call also void and place and intangible
						nature),<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 426.</note>
						bodies would have nothing in which to be and
					 <pb n='571'/>
					
					through which to move, as they are plainly seen to move. Beyond
						bodies and space there is nothing which by mental apprehension or on
						its analogy we can conceive to exist. When we speak of bodies and
						space, both are regarded as wholes or separate things, not as the
						properties or accidents of separate things.
					</p> 
					<p>"Again [<hi
						rend='ital'>he repeats this in the First Book and in Books XIV. and
						XV. of the work "On Nature" and in the Larger Epitome</hi>], of
						bodies some are composite, others the elements of which these
						composite bodies are made. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
						
						These elements are indivisible and unchangeable, and necessarily so, if things are not all to be
						destroyed and pass into non-existence, but are to be strong enough
						to endure when the composite bodies are broken up, because they
						possess a solid nature and are incapable of being anywhere or anyhow dissolved.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>&sect; 54.</note> It
						follows that the first beginnings must be indivisible, corporeal
						entities.
					</p> 
					<p>"Again, the sum of things is infinite. For what is
						finite has an extremity, and the extremity of anything is discerned
						only by comparison with something else. (Now the sum of things is
						not discerned by comparison with anything else :<note n='b'>The
							missing premiss is supplied by Cicero, <hi rend='ital'>De div.</hi>
							ii. 103 "at quod omne est, id non cernitur ex alio extrinsecus." <hi
								rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 960.</note>) hence, since it has no
						extremity, it has no limit ; and, since it has no limit, it must be
						unlimited or infinite.
					</p> 
					<p>"Moreover, the sum of things is
						unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the
						extent of the void. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
						
						For if the void were infinite and bodies finite,
						the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been
						dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any
						supports or counter-
					 <pb n='573'/> 
					checks to send them back
						on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the
						infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be.
					</p>
					
					<p>"Furthermore, the atoms, which have no void in them--out of which
						composite bodies arise and into which they are dissolved--vary
						indefinitely in their shapes ; for so many varieties of things as we
						see could never have arisen out of a recurrence of a definite number
						of the same shapes. The like atoms of each shape are absolutely
						infinite ; but the variety of shapes, though indefinitely large, is
						not absolutely infinite.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
						
						[<hi rend='ital'>For neither does the
							divisibility go on "ad infinitum," he says below</hi><note
								n='a'>Properly "further within"--a proof that the Scholiast read his
								Epicurus from a papyrus scroll which had to be unrolled. Hence

					</p> 
					<p>"The atoms are in continual motion through

								rend='ital'>that the atoms move with equal speed, since the void
								makes way for the lightest and heaviest alike.</hi>] Some of them
						rebound to a considerable distance from each other, while others
						merely oscillate in one place when they chance to have got entangled
						or to be enclosed by a mass of other atoms shaped for
						entangling.<note n='b'>Note the distinction between (1) solids,
							composed of interlacing atoms (which have got entangled), and (2)
							fluids, composed of atoms not interlaced, needing a sheath or
							container of other atoms, if they are to remain united. To (2)
							belongs Soul (&sect; 66). See Lucr. ii. 80-141 ; Cic. <hi rend='ital'>De
								fin.</hi> i. 7.</note>
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
					<p>"This is because each atom is
						separated from the rest by void, which is incapable of offering any
						resistance to the rebound ; while it is the solidity of the atom
						which makes it rebound after a collision,
					 <pb n='575'/>
					
					however short the distance to which it rebounds, when it finds
						itself imprisoned in a mass of entangling atoms. Of all this there
						is no beginning, since both atoms and void exist from everlasting.
						[<hi rend='ital'>He says below that atoms have no quality at all
							except shape, size, and weight. But that colour varies with the
							arrangement of the atoms he states in his "Twelve Rudiments" ;
							further, that they are not of any and every size ; at any rate no
							atom has ever been seen by our sense.</hi>]
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
					<p>"The repetition
						at such length of all that we are now recalling to mind furnishes an
						adequate outline for our conception of the nature of things.
					</p>
					
					<p>"Moreover, there is an infinite number of worlds, some like this
						world, others unlike it.<note n='a'>This remark is not misplaced.
							For infinity of worlds follows from the infinity of (<hi
								rend='ital'>a</hi>) atoms, (<hi rend='ital'>b</hi>) space ; see <hi
									rend='ital'>inf.</hi>&sect;&sect; 73, 89 ; Lucr. ii. 1048 foll.</note> For the
						atoms being infinite in number, as has just been proved, are borne
						ever further in their course. For the atoms out of which a world
						might arise, or by which a world might be formed, have not all been
						expended on one world or a finite number of worlds, whether like or
						unlike this one. Hence there will be nothing to hinder an infinity
						of worlds.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
					<p>"Again, there are outlines or films, which are of
						the same shape as solid bodies, but of a thinness far exceeding that
						of any object that we see. For it is not impossible that there
						should be found in the surrounding air combinations of this kind,
						materials adapted for expressing the hollowness and thinness of
						surfaces, and effluxes preserving the same relative position and
						motion which they had in the solid objects from which they come. To
						these films we give the name of `images' or `idols.' Further-
					
					<pb n='577'/> 
					more, so long as nothing comes in the way to offer
						resistance, motion through the void accomplishes any imaginable
						distance in an inconceivably short time. For resistance encountered
						is the equivalent of slowness, its absence the equivalent of
						speed.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>
					<p>"Not that, if we consider the minute times perceptible by reason alone,<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr.
							iv. 794-8 : "In one unit of time, when we can perceive it by sense
							and while one single word is uttered, many latent times are
							contained which reason finds to exist" Obviously such minute "times"
							are immeasurably short. The unit of sensible time appears to be that

						would be equivalent to its meeting with resistance, even if up to
						that point we allow nothing to impede the rate of its flight. This
						is an elementary fact which in itself is well worth bearing in mind.
						In the next place the exceeding thinness of the images is
						contradicted by none of the facts under our observation. Hence also
						their velocities are enormous, since they always find a void passage

						For without the transmission from the object of

							noise. Lucretius treats of hearing in iv. 524-614, ii.

						air is acted upon by it in this way. The blow which is struck in us
						when we utter a sound causes such a displacement of the particles as
						serves to produce a current resembling breath, and this displacement
						gives rise to the sensation of hearing.

					<p>"Again, we must

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
					<p>"For in the case of

						the qualities are not supposed, like the shape which is left behind,
						to inhere in the subject of change, but to vanish altogether from
						the body. Thus, then, what is left behind is sufficient to account
						for the differences in composite bodies, since something at least
						must necessarily be left remaining and be immune from
						annihilation.
					</p> 
					<p>"Again, you should not suppose that the atoms
						have any and every size, <note n='d'>The opinion of

						common property we think we shall distinguish something in the
						minimum, one part on one side and another part on the other side, it
						must be another minimum equal to the first which catches our eye. In
						fact, we see these minima one after another, beginning with the
						first, and not as occupying the same space ; nor do we see them
						touch one another's parts with their parts, but we see that by
						virtue of their own peculiar character (<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> as

					<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
					<p>"We must

						within our experience we have declared that the atom has magnitude ;
						and this, small as it is, we have merely reproduced on a larger
						scale. And further, the least and simplest<note n='c'><hi

					employed, since direct observation is impossible. For the
						community which exists between them and the unchangeable parts (<hi

						one direction of motion, which we conceive as extending upwards <hi

						should happen ten thousand times that what moves from us to the

					<p>"When they are travelling

					its particles and thereby keeps
						in closer touch with the rest of the frame.<note n='a'>The so-called
							"nameless" substance (<hi rend='ital'>nominis expers</hi> Lucr. iii.
							242, <foreign lang='greek'> a)katon o/masto n</foreign> in
							Epicurus).</note> And this is shown by the mental faculties and
						feelings, by the ease with which the mind moves, and by thoughts,
						and by all those things the loss of which causes death. Further, we
						must keep in mind that soul has the greatest share in causing
						sensation. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
						
						Still, it would not have had sensation, had it not been
						somehow confined within the rest of the frame. But the rest of the
						frame, though it provides this indispensable condition<note
							n='b'>The body, by keeping soul-atoms together without much
							dispersion, allows them to vibrate with the motions that generate
							sentience and sensation.</note> for the soul, itself also has a
						share, derived from the soul, of the said quality ; and yet does not
						possess all the qualities of soul. Hence on the departure of the
						soul it loses sentience. For it had not this power in itself ; but
						something else, congenital with the body, supplied it to body :
						which other thing, through the potentiality actualized in it by
						means of motion, at once acquired for itself a quality of sentience,

						them, imparted it (as I said) to the body also.

					<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>

						dislocated in whole or in part, and portions of the soul may thereby
						be lost ; yet in spite of this the soul, if it manage to survive,

					have departed, which, however few in
						number, are required to constitute the nature of soul. Moreover,
						when the whole frame is broken up,<note n='a'><hi

					<p>"There is the

					<p>"Moreover, shapes and

						formed by grouping them together in the same way as when from the
						particles themselves a larger aggregate is made up, whether these
						particles be primary or any magnitudes whatsoever less than the
						particular whole. All these qualities, I repeat, merely give the
						body its own permanent nature. They all have their own characteristic modes of being perceived and distinguished, but always
						along with the whole body in which they inhere and never in
						separation from it ; and it is in virtue of this complete conception
						of the body as a whole that it is so designated.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
					<p>"Again,
						qualities often attach to bodies without
					 <pb n='601'/>

						whole thing to which they belong, and to which, conceiving it as a
						whole, we give the name of body, nor that of the permanent
						properties without which body cannot be thought of. And in virtue of
						certain peculiar modes of apprehension into which the complete
						body always enters, each of them can be called an accident. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
						
						But only
						as often as they are seen actually to belong to it, since such

						from reality this clear evidence that the accident has not the

						the permanent properties which accompany the whole. Nor, on the
						other hand, must we suppose the accident to have independent
						existence (for this is just as inconceivable in the case of

					<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
					<p>"There is another

						namely, by referring them to the preconceptions envisaged in our
						minds ; but we must take into account the plain fact itself, in
						virtue of which we speak of time as long or short, linking to it in
						intimate connexion this attribute of duration.<note n='b'><hi

						contained in the proper meaning of the word `time' (for this also is
						done by some). We must chiefly reflect upon that to which we attach
						this peculiar character of time, and by which we measure it. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
						
						No
						further proof is required : we have only to reflect that we attach
						the attribute of time to days and nights and their parts, and
						likewise to feelings of pleasure and pain and to neutral states, to
						states of movement and states of rest, conceiving a peculiar

					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
					<p>"And further, we
						must not suppose that the worlds have necessarily one and the same

							nurture in a world after they have arisen. And so too we must think
							it happens upon the earth also.</hi>]
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
					<p>"Again, we must suppose
						that nature<note n='a'>That is, nature working in primitive man,
							almost the same thing as instinct.</note> too has been taught and
						forced to learn many various lessons by the facts themselves, that
						reason subsequently develops what it has thus received and makes
						fresh discoveries, among some tribes more quickly, among others more
						slowly, the progress thus made being at certain times and seasons
						greater, at others less.
					</p> 
					<p>"Hence even the names of things were
						not originally due to convention,<note n='b'><hi
							rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. v. 1041 f. Heraclitus, Democritus, and
							Aristotle derived language from convention.</note> but in the
						several tribes under the impulse of special feelings and special
						presentations of sense primitive man uttered special cries.<note
							n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. v. 1028, 1029,
							1056-1058.</note> The air thus emitted was moulded by their
						individual feelings or sense-presentations, and differently according to the difference of the regions which the tribes inhabited.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
						
						Subsequently whole tribes adopted their own special names, in order
						that their communications might be less ambiguous to each other
						and more briefly expressed. And as for things not visible, so far as
						those who were conscious of them tried to introduce any such notion,
						they put in circulation certain names for them, either sounds which
						they
					 <pb n='607'/> 
					were instinctively compelled to utter or
						which they selected by reason on analogy according to the most
						general cause there can be for expressing oneself in such a
						way.<note n='a'>See Bignone, p. 107 note 3.</note>
					</p> 
					<p>"Nay more
						: we are bound to believe that in the sky revolutions, solstices,
						eclipses, risings and settings, and the like, take place without the
						ministration or command, either now or in the future, of any being
						who at the same time enjoys perfect bliss along with immortality.
						<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
						
						For troubles and anxieties and feelings of anger and partiality do
						not accord with bliss, but always imply weakness and fear and
						dependence upon one's neighbours. Nor, again, must we hold that
						things which are no more than globular masses of fire, being at the
						same time endowed with bliss, assume these motions at will. Nay, in
						every term we use we must hold fast to all the majesty which
						attaches to such notions as bliss and immortality, lest the terms
						should generate opinions inconsistent with this majesty. Otherwise
						such inconsistency will of itself suffice to produce the worst
						disturbance in our minds. Hence, where we find phenomena invariably recurring, the invariableness of the recurrence must be
						ascribed to the original interception and conglomeration of atoms
						whereby the world was formed.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
					<p>"Further, we must hold that to
						arrive at accurate knowledge of the cause of things of most moment
						is the business of natural science, and that happiness depends on
						this (viz. on the knowledge of celestial and atmospheric phenomena),
						and upon knowing what the heavenly bodies really are, and any
						kindred facts contributing to exact knowledge in this respect.<note
							n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> to secure the end of
							happiness.</note>
					</p> <pb n='609'/> 
					<p>"Further, we must recognize
						on such points as this no plurality of causes or contingency, but
						must hold that nothing suggestive of conflict or disquiet is
						compatible with an immortal and blessed nature. And the mind can
						grasp the absolute truth of this.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
					<p>"But when we come to
						subjects for special inquiry, there is nothing in the knowledge of
						risings and settings and solstices and eclipses and all kindred
						subjects that contributes to our happiness ; but those who are
						well-informed about such matters and yet are ignorant what the
						heavenly bodies really are, and what are the most important causes
						of phenomena, feel quite as much fear as those who have no such
						special information--nay, perhaps even greater fear, when the
						curiosity excited by this additional knowledge cannot find a
						solution or understand the subordination of these phenomena to the
						highest causes.
					</p> 
					<p>"Hence, if we discover more than one cause
						that may account for solstices, settings and risings, eclipses and
						the like, as we did also in particular matters of detail, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
						
						we must
						not suppose that our treatment of these matters fails of accuracy,
						so far as it is needful to ensure our tranquillity and happiness.
						When, therefore, we investigate the causes of celestial and
						atmospheric phenomena, as of all that is unknown, we must take
						into account the variety of ways in which analogous occurrences
						happen within our experience ; while as for those who do not
						recognize the difference between what is or comes about from a
						single cause and that which may be the effect of any one of several
						causes, overlooking the fact that the objects are only seen at a
						distance, and are moreover ignorant of the conditions that render,
						or do not render, peace of mind impossible
					 <pb n='611'/>
					
					--all such persons we must treat with contempt. If then we think
						that an event could happen in one or other particular way out of
						several, we shall be as tranquil when we recognize that it actually
						comes about in more ways than one as if we knew that it happens in
						this particular way.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
					<p>"There is yet one more point to seize,
						namely, that the greatest anxiety of the human mind arises through
						the belief that the heavenly bodies are blessed and indestructible,
						and that at the same time they have volitions and actions and
						causality inconsistent with this belief ; and through expecting or
						apprehending some everlasting evil, either because of the myths, or
						because we are in dread of the mere insensibility of death, as if it
						had to do with us ; and through being reduced to this state not by
						conviction but by a certain irrational perversity, so that, if men
						do not set bounds to their terror, they endure as much or even more
						intense anxiety than the man whose views on these matters are quite
						vague. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
						
						But mental tranquillity means being released from all these
						troubles and cherishing a continual remembrance of the highest and
						most important truths.
					</p> 
					<p>"Hence we must attend to present
						feelings and sense perceptions, whether those of mankind in general
						or those peculiar to the individual, and also attend to all the
						clear evidence available, as given by each of the standards of
						truth. For by studying them we shall rightly trace to its cause and
						banish the source of disturbance and dread, accounting for celestial
						phenomena and for all other things which from time to time befall us
						and cause the utmost alarm to the rest of mankind.

					<p>"Here then,

						be of constant service to him.
					</p> 
					<p>"It is of such a sort that

					<p>"In your letter to me,

						To aid your memory you ask me for a clear and concise statement

						<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
						We will then complete our writing and grant all you ask. Many others
						besides you will find these reasonings useful, and especially those
						who have but recently made acquaintance with the true story of
						nature and those who are attached to pursuits which go deeper than
						any part of ordinary education. So you will do well to take and
						learn them and get them up quickly along with the short epitome in
						my letter to Herodotus.<note n='a'>This would seem decisive of what
							the Shorter Catechism of Epicurus really was ; see, however,
							&sect; 135.</note>
					</p> 
					<p>"In the first place, remember that, like

						than peace of mind and firm conviction.<note n='b'>Philosophy is

						<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
						
						We do not seek to wrest by force what is impossible,
						nor to understand all matters equally well, nor make our treatment
						always as clear as when we discuss human life or explain the
						principles of physics in general--for instance, that the whole of
						being consists of bodies and intangible nature, or that the ultimate
						elements of things are indivisible, or any other proposition which
						admits only one explanation of the phenomena to be possible. But
						this is not the case with celestial phenomena : these at any rate
						admit of manifold causes for their occurrence and manifold
						accounts, none of them contradictory of sensation, of their
						nature.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
					<p>"For in the study of nature we must not conform to
						empty assumptions and arbitrary laws, but follow the promptings of
						the facts ; for our life has no need now of unreason and false
						opinion ; our one need is untroubled existence. All things go on
						uninterruptedly, if all be explained by the method of
					</p> <pb
						n='617'/> 
					<p>plurality of causes in conformity with the facts, so
						soon as we duly understand what may be plausibly alleged respecting
						them. But when we pick and choose among them, rejecting one equally
						consistent with the phenomena, we clearly fall away from the study
						of nature altogether and tumble into myth. Some phenomena within our
						experience afford evidence by which we may interpret what goes on
						in the heavens. We see how the former really take place, but not how
						the celestial phenomena take place, for their occurrence may
						possibly be due to a variety of causes. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
						
						However, we must observe
						each fact as presented, and further separate from it all the facts
						presented along with it, the occurrence of which from various causes
						is not contradicted by facts within our experience.
					</p> 
					<p>"A world
						is a circumscribed portion of the universe, which contains stars and
						earth and all other visible things, cut off from the infinite, and
						terminating [<hi rend='ital'>and terminating in a boundary which may
							be either thick or thin, a boundary whose dissolution will bring
							about the wreck of all within it</hi>] in an exterior which may
						either revolve or be at rest, and be round or triangular or of any

						are contradicted by none of the facts in this world, in which an
						extremity can nowhere be discerned.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
					<p>"That there is an

					<p>"The waning of the moon

						equally well to configurations which the air assumes ; further, it
						may be due to the interposition of certain bodies. In short, it may
						happen in any of the ways in which the facts within our experience
						suggest such an appearance to be explicable. But one must not be so
						much in love with the explanation by a single way as wrongly to
						reject all the others from ignorance of what can, and what cannot,
						be within human knowledge, and consequent longing to discover the
						indiscoverable. Further, the moon may possibly shine by her own
						light, just as possibly she may derive her light from the sun ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
						
						for
						in our own experience we see many things which shine by their own

						the method of plural explanation and the several consistent assumptions and causes, instead of dwelling on what is inconsistent and
						giving it a false importance so as always to fall back in one way or
						another upon the single explanation. The appearance of the face in
						the moon may equally well arise from interchange of parts, or from
						interposition of something, or in any other of the ways which might

						which agree with one another, and remember that the concurrence of

					</p> 
					<p>"And further, let the regularity of their
						orbits be explained in the same way as certain ordinary incidents
						within our own experience ; the divine nature must not on any
						account be adduced to explain this, but must be kept free from the
						task and in perfect bliss. Unless this be done, the whole study of
						celestial phenomena will be in vain, as indeed it has proved to be
						with some who did not lay hold of a possible method, but fell into
						the folly of supposing that these events happen in one single way
						only and of rejecting all the others which are possible, suffering
						themselves to be carried into the realm of the unintelligible, and
						being unable to take a comprehensive view of the facts which must

					<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
					<p>"The variations in the length
						of nights and days
					 <pb n='627'/> 
					may be due to the swiftness
						and again to the slowness of the sun's motion in the sky, owing to
						the variations in the length of spaces traversed and to his
						accomplishing some distances more swiftly or more slowly, as happens
						sometimes within our own experience ; and with these facts our
						explanation of celestial phenomena must agree ; whereas those who
						adopt only one explanation are in conflict with the facts and are
						utterly mistaken as to the way in which man can attain
						knowledge.
					</p> 
					<p>"The signs in the sky which betoken the weather
						may be due to mere coincidence of the seasons, as is the case with
						signs from animals seen on earth, or they may be caused by changes

					<p>"Clouds
						may form and gather either because the air is condensed under the
						pressure of winds, or because atoms which hold together and are
						suitable to produce this result become mutually entangled, or
						because currents collect from the earth and the waters ; and there
						are several other ways in which it is not impossible for the
						aggregations of such bodies into clouds to be brought about. And
						that being so, rain may be produced from them sometimes by their
						compression, sometimes by their transformation ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
						
						or again may be
						caused by exhalations of moisture rising<note n='a'>Lucr. vi.

						violent inundation is due to certain accumulations suitable for such
						discharge. Thunder may be due to the rolling of wind in the hollow
						parts of the clouds, as it is sometimes imprisoned in vessels
						which we use ; or to the roaring of
					 <pb n='629'/> 
					fire in
						them when blown by a wind,<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr.

						to the friction and splitting up of clouds when they have become as
						firm as ice. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
						
						As in the whole survey, so in this particular point,
						the facts invite us to give a plurality of explanations. Lightnings
						too happen in a variety of ways. For when the clouds rub against
						each other and collide, that collocation of atoms which is the cause
						of fire generates lightning ; or it may be due to the flashing forth
						from the clouds, by reason of winds, of particles capable of
						producing this brightness ; or else it is squeezed out of the clouds
						when they have been condensed either by their own action or by that
						of the winds ; or again, the light diffused from the stars may be
						enclosed in the clouds, then driven about by their motion and by
						that of the winds, and finally make its escape from the clouds ; or
						light of the finest texture may be filtered through the clouds
						(whereby the clouds may be set on fire and thunder produced), and
						the motion of this light may make lightning ; or it may arise from
						the combustion of wind brought about by the violence of its motion
						and the intensity of its compression ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
						
						or, when the clouds are rent
						asunder by winds, and the atoms which generate fire are expelled,
						these likewise cause lightning to appear. And it may easily be seen
						that its occurrence is possible in many other ways, so long as we
						hold fast to facts and take a general view of what is analogous to
						them. Lightning precedes thunder, when the clouds are constituted as
						mentioned above and the configuration which produces lightning is
						expelled at the moment when the wind falls upon the cloud, and
					
					<pb n='631'/> 
					the wind being rolled up afterwards produces the
						roar of thunder ; or, if both are simultaneous, the lightning moves
						with a greater velocity towards us
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
						
						and the thunder lags behind,
						exactly as when persons who are striking blows are observed from a
						distance.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>e.g.,</hi> as Apelt remarks,
							when the blows struck by a great hammer on a block of iron are
							watched from a distance, and it takes some time for the sound to
							reach one's ear.</note> A thunderbolt is caused when winds are
						repeatedly collected, imprisoned, and violently ignited ; or when a
						part is torn asunder and is more violently expelled downwards, the
						rending being due to the fact that the compression of the clouds has
						made the neighbouring parts more dense ; or again it may be due like
						thunder merely to the expulsion of the imprisoned fire, when this
						has accumulated and been more violently inflated with wind and has
						torn the cloud, being unable to withdraw to the adjacent parts
						because it is continually more and more closely
						compressed--[generally by some high mountain where thunderbolts
						mostly fall]. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
						
						And there are several other ways in which thunderbolts
						may possibly be produced. Exclusion of myth is the sole condition
						necessary ; and it will be excluded, if one properly attends to the
						facts and hence draws inferences to interpret what is obscure.

					<p>"Fiery whirlwinds are due to the descent of a cloud forced
						downwards like a pillar by the wind in full force and carried by a
						gale round and round, while at the same time the outside wind gives
						the cloud a lateral thrust ; or it may be due to a change of the
						wind which veers to all points of the compass as a current of air
						from above helps to force it to move ; or it may be that a strong
						eddy of winds has been
					 <pb n='633'/> 
					started and is unable to
						burst through laterally because the air around is closely condensed.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
						And when they descend upon land, they cause what are called
						tornadoes, in accordance with the various ways in which they are
						produced through the force of the wind ; and when let down upon the
						sea, they cause waterspouts.
					</p> 
					<p>"Earthquakes may be due to the
						imprisonment of wind underground, and to its being interspersed with
						small masses of earth and then set in continuous motion, thus
						causing the earth to tremble. And the earth either takes in this
						wind from without or from the falling in of foundations, when
						undermined, into subterranean caverns, thus raising a wind in the
						imprisoned air. Or they may be due to the propagation of movement
						arising from the fall of many foundations and to its being again
						checked when it encounters the more solid resistance of earth.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
						
						And
						there are many other causes to which these oscillations of the
						earth may be due.
					</p> 
					<p>"Winds arise from time to time when foreign
						matter continually and gradually finds its way into the air ; also
						through the gathering of great store of water. The rest of the winds
						arise when a few of them fall into the many hollows and they are
						thus divided and multiplied.
					</p> 
					<p>"Hail is caused by the firmer
						congelation and complete transformation, and subsequent distribution
						into drops, of certain particles resembling wind : also by the
						slighter congelation of certain particles of moisture and the
						vicinity of certain particles of wind which at one and the same time
						forces them together and makes them burst, so that they become
						frozen in parts and in the whole mass. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
						
						The round
					 <pb n='635'/>
					
					shape of hailstones is not impossibly due to the extremities on
						all sides being melted and to the fact that, as explained, particles
						either of moisture or of wind surround them evenly on all sides and
						in every quarter, when they freeze.
					</p> 
					<p>"Snow may be formed when
						a fine rain issues from the clouds because the pores are symmetrical
						and because of the continuous and violent pressure of the winds upon
						clouds which are suitable ; and then this rain has been frozen on
						its way because of some violent change to coldness in the regions
						below the clouds. Or again, by congelation in clouds which have
						uniform density a fall of snow might occur through the clouds which
						contain moisture being densely packed in close proximity to each
						other ; and these clouds produce a sort of compression and cause
						hail, and this happens mostly in spring. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
						
						And when frozen clouds rub
						against each other, this accumulation of snow might be thrown off.
						And there are other ways in which snow might be formed.
					</p> 
					<p>"Dew
						is formed when such particles as are capable of producing this sort
						of moisture meet each other from the air : again by their rising
						from moist and damp places, the sort of place where dew is chiefly
						formed, and their subsequent coalescence, so as to create moisture
						and fall downwards, just as in several cases something similar is
						observed to take place under our eyes. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>
						
						And the formation of
						hoar-frost is not different from that of dew, certain particles of
						such a nature becoming in some such way congealed owing to a certain
						condition of cold air.
					</p> <pb n='637'/> 
					<p>"Ice is formed by the
						expulsion from the water of the circular, and the compression of the
						scalene and acute-angled atoms contained in it ; further by the
						accretion of such atoms from without, which being driven together
						cause the water to solidify after the expulsion of a certain number
						of round atoms.
					</p> 
					<p>"The rainbow arises when the sun shines upon
						humid air ; or again by a certain peculiar blending of light with
						air, which will cause either all the distinctive qualities of these
						colours or else some of them belonging to a single kind, and from
						the reflection of this light the air all around will be coloured as
						we see it to be, as the sun shines upon its parts. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
						
						The circular
						shape which it assumes is due to the fact that the distance of every
						point is perceived by our sight to be equal ; or it may be because,
						the atoms in the air or in the clouds and deriving from the sun
						having been thus united, the aggregate of them presents a sort of
						roundness.
					</p> 
					<p>"A halo round the moon arises because the air on
						all sides extends to the moon ; or because it equably raises upwards
						the currents from the moon so high as to impress a circle upon the
						cloudy mass and not to separate it altogether ; or because it raises
						the air which immediately surrounds the moon symmetrically from
						all sides up to a circumference round her and there forms a thick
						ring. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
						
						And this happens at certain parts either because a current has
						forced its way in from without or because the heat has gained
						possession of certain passages in order to effect this.
					</p>
					
					<p>"Comets arise either because fire is nourished in
					</p> <pb
						n='639'/> 
					<p>certain places at certain intervals in the heavens, if
						circumstances are favourable ; or because at times the heaven has a
						particular motion above us so that such stars appear ; or because
						the stars themselves are set in motion under certain conditions and
						come to our neighbourhood and show themselves. And their
						disappearance is due to the causes which are the opposite of these.
						<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>
						
						Certain stars may revolve without setting not only for the reason
						alleged by some, because this is the part of the world round which,
						itself unmoved, the rest revolves, but it may also be because a
						circular eddy of air surrounds this part, which prevents them from
						travelling out of sight like other stars ; or because there is a
						dearth of necessary fuel farther on, while there is abundance in
						that part where they are seen to be. Moreover there are several
						other ways in which this might be brought about, as may be seen by
						anyone capable of reasoning in accordance with the facts. The
						wanderings of certain stars, if such wandering is their actual
						motion, and the regular movement of certain other stars, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>
						
						may be
						accounted for by saying that they originally moved in a circle and
						were constrained, some of them to be whirled round with the same
						uniform rotation and others with a whirling motion which varied ;
						but it may also be that according to the diversity of the regions
						traversed in some places there are uniform tracts of air, forcing
						them forward in one direction and burning uniformly, in others these
						tracts present such irregularities as cause the motions observed. To
						assign a single cause for these effects when the facts suggest
						several causes is madness and a strange inconsistency ; yet it is
						done by adherents of rash astronomy, who assign meaning-
					</p> <pb
						n='641'/> 
					<p>less causes for the stars whenever they persist in
						saddling the divinity with burdensome tasks. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
						
						That certain stars are
						seen to be left behind by others may be because they travel more
						slowly, though they go the same round as the others ; or it may be
						that they are drawn back by the same whirling motion and move in the
						opposite direction ; or again it may be that some travel over a
						larger and others over a smaller space in making the same
						revolution. But to lay down as assured a single explanation of these
						phenomena is worthy of those who seek to dazzle the multitude with
						marvels.
					</p> 
					<p>"Falling stars, as they are called, may in some
						cases be due to the mutual friction of the stars themselves, in
						other cases to the expulsion of certain parts when that mixture of
						fire and air takes place which was mentioned when we were discussing
						lightning ; 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
						
						or it may be due to the meeting of atoms capable of
						generating fire, which accord so well as to produce this result, and
						their subsequent motion wherever the impulse which brought them
						together at first leads them ; or it may be that wind collects in
						certain dense mist-like masses and, since it is imprisoned, ignites
						and then bursts forth upon whatever is round about it, and is
						carried to that place to which its motion impels it. And there are
						other ways in which this can be brought about without recourse to
						myths.

						Such

					</p> 
					<p>But as to the conduct
						of life, what we ought to avoid and what to choose, he writes as
						follows.<note n='a'>Between the letter to Pythocles and that to
							Menoeceus come excerpts (&sect;&sect; 117-120) dealing with the wise man as

							tenets.</note> Before quoting his words, however, let me go into the
						views of Epicurus himself and his school concerning the wise
						man.
					</p> 
					<p>There are three motives to injurious acts among
						men--hatred, envy, and contempt ; and these the wise man overcomes
						by reason. Moreover, he who has once become wise never more assumes
						the opposite habit, not even in semblance, if he can help it. He
						will be more susceptible of emotion than other men : that will be no
						hindrance to his wisdom. However, not every bodily constitution nor
						every nationality would permit a man to become wise.
					</p> <pb n='645'/> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
					<p>Even on the rack the wise man is happy. He alone will
						feel gratitude towards friends, present and absent alike, and show
						it by word and deed. When on the rack, however, he will give vent to
						cries and groans. As regards women he will submit to the
						restrictions imposed by the law, as Diogenes says in his epitome of
						Epicurus' ethical doctrines. Nor will he punish his servants ;
						rather he will pity them and make allowance on occasion for those
						who are of good character. The Epicureans do not suffer the wise man
						to fall in love ; nor will he trouble himself about funeral rites;
						according to them love does not come by divine inspiration : so
						Diogenes in his twelfth book. The wise man will not make fine
						speeches. No one was ever the better for sexual indulgence, and it
						is well if he be not the worse.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
					<p>Nor, again, will the wise man
						marry and rear a family : so Epicurus says in the <hi
							rend='ital'>Problems</hi> and in the <hi rend='ital'>De Natura.</hi>
						Occasionally he may marry owing to special circumstances in his
						life. Some too will turn aside from their purpose. Nor will he
						drivel, when drunken : so Epicurus says in the <hi
							rend='ital'>Symposium.</hi> Nor will he take part in politics, as is
						stated in the first book <hi rend='ital'>On Life</hi> ; nor will he
						make himself a tyrant ; nor will he turn Cynic (so the second book
						<hi rend='ital'>On Life</hi> tells us) ; nor will he be a mendicant.
						But even when he has lost his sight, he will not withdraw
						himself<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> by suicide, as
							recommended by the Stoics (<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>, vii.
							130).</note> from life : this is stated in the same book. The wise
						man will also feel grief, according to Diogenes in the fifth book of
						his <hi rend='ital'>Epilecta.</hi> And he will take a suit into
						court. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="120"/>
						
						He will leave written words behind him, but will not compose
						panegyric. He will have regard to his property and to the
						future.
					</p> <pb n='647'/> 
					<p>He will be fond of the country. He will
						be armed against fortune and will never give up a friend. He will
						pay just so much regard to his reputation as not to be looked down
						upon. He will take more delight than other men in state
						festivals.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Philodemus, <foreign lang='greek'>*peri\ eu)sebe i/as</foreign> (Us. p. 258).</note>

					<p><note n='b'>The transposition of this paragraph is due to Bignone
						(p. 214, notes 2, 4).</note>The wise man will set up votive images.
						Whether he is well off or not will be matter of indifference to him.

						does not move more wisely than another. And he will make money, but
						only by his wisdom, if he should be in poverty, and he will pay
						court to a king, if need be. He will be grateful to anyone when he
						is corrected. He will found a school, but not in such a manner as to
						draw the crowd after him ; and will give readings in public, but
						only by request. He will be a dogmatist but not a mere sceptic ; and
						he will be like himself even when asleep. And he will on occasion
						die for a friend.
					</p> 
					<p>The school holds that sins are not all
						equal ; that health is in some cases a good, in others a thing
						indifferent ; that courage is not a natural gift but comes from
						calculation of expediency ; and that friendship is prompted by our
						needs. One of the friends, however, must make the first advances

					<milestone unit="section" n="121"/>
					<p>Two
						sorts of happiness can be conceived, the one the highest possible,
						such as the gods enjoy, which cannot be augmented, the other
						admitting addition and subtraction of pleasures.
					</p> 
					<p>We must now
						proceed to his letter.
					</p> <pb n='649'/> 
					<p>"Epicurus to Menoeceus,
						greeting.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="122"/>
					<p>"Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young
						nor weary in the search thereof when he is grown old. For no age is
						too early or too late for the health of the soul. And to say that
						the season for studying philosophy has not yet come, or that it is
						past and gone, is like saying that the season for happiness is not
						yet or that it is now no more. Therefore, both old and young ought
						to seek wisdom, the former in order that, as age comes over him, he
						may be young in good things because of the grace of what has been,
						and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may at the same
						time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are to come.
						So we must exercise ourselves in the things which bring happiness,
						since, if that be present, we have everything, and, if that be
						absent, all our actions are directed toward attaining it.
					</p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="123"/>
					<p>"Those things which without ceasing I have declared unto thee,
						those do, and exercise thyself therein, holding them to be the
						elements of right life. First believe that God is a living being immortal and blessed, according to the notion of a god indicated by
						the common sense of mankind ; and so believing, thou shalt not
						affirm of him aught that is foreign to his immortality or that
						agrees not with blessedness, but shalt believe about him whatever
						may uphold both his blessedness and his immortality. For verily
						there are gods, and the knowledge of them is manifest ; but they are
						not such as the multitude believe, seeing that men do not
						steadfastly maintain the notions they form respecting them. Not the
						man who denies the gods worshipped by the multitude, but he who
						affirms of the gods what the multi-
					 <pb n='651'/> 
					tude
						believes about them is truly impious. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="124"/>
						
						For the utterances of the
						multitude about the gods are not true preconceptions but false
						assumptions ; hence it is that the greatest evils happen to the
						wicked and the greatest blessings happen to the good from the hand
						of the gods, seeing that they are always favourable to their own
						good qualities and take pleasure in men like unto themselves, but
						reject as alien whatever is not of their kind.
					</p> 
					<p>"Accustom
						thyself to believe that death is nothing to us, for good and evil
						imply sentience, and death is the privation of all sentience ;
						therefore a right understanding that death is nothing to us makes
						the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life an
						illimitable time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality.
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="125"/>
						For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly apprehended that
						there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore,
						is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain
						when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatsoever
						causes no annoyance when it is present, causes only a groundless
						pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of
						evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not
						come, and, when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then,
						either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not
						and the dead exist no longer.<note n='a'>The striking resemblance to
							this passage of ps.-Plat. <hi rend='ital'>Axiochus</hi>, 369 b, has
							often been pointed out, most recently by E. Chevallier, <hi
								rend='ital'>Etude crit. du dialogue ps.-plat. l'Axiochos</hi> (Lyon,
							1914, pp. 74 <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi>) ; he rightly maintains the
							priority of the letter to Menoeceus (<hi rend='ital'>ib.</hi> p.
							76).</note> But in the world, at one time men shun death as the
						greatest of all evils, and at another time choose it as a respite
						from the evils in life. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="126"/>
						
						The wise man does not deprecate life nor
						does he fear the cessation
					 <pb n='653'/> 
					of life. The thought
						of life is no offence to him, nor is the cessation of life regarded
						as an evil. And even as men choose of food not merely and simply the
						larger portion, but the more pleasant, so the wise seek to enjoy the
						time which is most pleasant and not merely that which is longest.
						And he who admonishes the young to live well and the old to make a
						good end speaks foolishly, not merely because of the desirableness
						of life, but because the same exercise at once teaches to live well
						and to die well. Much worse is he who says that it were good not to
						be born, but when once one is born to pass with all speed through
						the gates of Hades.<note n='a'>Theognis 425, 427.</note> 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>
						
						For if he
						truly believes this, why does he not depart from life ? It were easy
						for him to do so, if once he were firmly convinced. If he speaks
						only in mockery, his words are foolishness, for those who hear
						believe him not.
					</p> 
					<p>"We must remember that the future is neither
						wholly ours nor wholly not ours, so that neither must we count upon
						it as quite certain to come nor despair of it as quite certain not
						to come.
					</p> 
					<p>"We must also reflect that of desires some are
						natural, others are groundless ; and that of the natural some are
						necessary as well as natural, and some natural only. And of the
						necessary desires some are necessary if we are to be happy, some if
						the body is to be rid of uneasiness, some if we are even to live. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>
						
						He
						who has a clear and certain understanding of these things will
						direct every preference and aversion toward securing health of body
						and tranquillity of mind, seeing that this is the sum and end of a
						blessed life. For the end of all our actions is to be free from pain
						and fear, and, when once we
					 <pb n='655'/> 
					have attained all
						this, the tempest of the soul is laid ; seeing that the living
						creature has no need to go in search of something that is lacking,
						nor to look for anything else by which the good of the soul and of
						the body will be fulfilled. When we are pained because of the
						absence of pleasure, then, and then only, do we feel the need of
						pleasure. Wherefore we call pleasure the alpha and omega of a
						blessed life. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="129"/>
						
						Pleasure is our first and kindred good. It is the
						starting-point of every choice and of every aversion, and to it we
						come back, inasmuch as we make feeling the rule by which to judge of
						every good thing. And since pleasure is our first and native good,
						for that reason we do not choose every pleasure whatsoever, but
						ofttimes pass over many pleasures when a greater annoyance ensues
						from them. And ofttimes we consider pains superior to pleasures when
						submission to the pains for a long time brings us as a consequence a
						greater pleasure. While therefore all pleasure because it is
						naturally akin to us is good, not all pleasure is choiceworthy, just
						as all pain is an evil and yet not all pain is to be shunned. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="130"/>
						
						It is,
						however, by measuring one against another, and by looking at the
						conveniences and inconveniences, that all these matters must be
						judged. Sometimes we treat the good as an evil, and the evil, on the
						contrary, as a good. Again, we regard independence of outward things
						as a great good, not so as in all cases to use little, but so as to
						be contented with little if we have not much, being honestly
						persuaded that they have the sweetest enjoyment of luxury who stand
						least in need of it, and that whatever is natural is easily procured
						and only the vain and worthless hard to win. Plain fare
					</p> <pb
						n='657'/> 
					<p>gives as much pleasure as a costly diet, when once the
						pain of want has been removed, 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="131"/>
						
						while bread and water confer the
						highest possible pleasure when they are brought to hungry lips. To
						habituate one's self, therefore, to simple and inexpensive diet
						supplies all that is needful for health, and enables a man to meet
						the necessary requirements of life without shrinking, and it places
						us in a better condition when we approach at intervals a costly fare
						and renders us fearless of fortune.
					</p> 
					<p>"When we say, then, that
						pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the
						prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do
						by some through ignorance, prejudice, or wilful misrepresentation.
						By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble
						in the soul. 
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="132"/>
						
						It is not an unbroken succession of drinking-bouts and
						of revelry, not sexual love, not the enjoyment of the fish and other
						delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life ;
						it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and
						avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest
						tumults take possession of the soul. Of all this the beginning and
						the greatest good is prudence. Wherefore prudence is a more
						precious thing even than philosophy ; from it spring all the other
						virtues, for it teaches that we cannot lead a life of pleasure which
						is not also a life of prudence, honour, and justice ; nor lead a
						life of prudence, honour, and justice, which is not also a life of
						pleasure. For the virtues have grown into one with a pleasant life,
						and a pleasant life is inseparable from them.

					<milestone unit="section" n="133"/>
					<p>"Who, then, is
						superior in thy judgement to such a man ? He holds a holy belief
						concerning the gods,
					 <pb n='659'/> 
					and is altogether free
						from the fear of death. He has diligently considered the end fixed
						by nature, and understands how easily the limit of good things can
						be reached and attained, and how either the duration or the
						intensity of evils is but slight. Destiny, which some introduce as
						sovereign over all things, he laughs to scorn, affirming rather that
						some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through
						our own agency. For he sees that necessity destroys responsibility
						and that chance or fortune is inconstant ; whereas our own actions
						are free, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.
						<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>
						It were better, indeed, to accept the legends of the gods than to
						bow beneath that yoke of destiny which the natural philosophers have
						imposed. The one holds out some faint hope that we may escape if we
						honour the gods, while the necessity of the naturalists is deaf to
						all entreaties. Nor does he hold chance to be a god, as the world in
						general does, for in the acts of a god there is no disorder ; nor to
						be a cause, though an uncertain one, for he believes that no good or
						evil is dispensed by chance to men so as to make life blessed,
						though it supplies the starting-point of great good and great evil.
						He believes that the misfortune of the wise is better than the

					<p>Such are his views on life and
						conduct ; and he has discoursed upon them at greater length
						elsewhere.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>
					<p>He differs from the Cyrenaics<note n='b'>Next come
						excerpts dealing with the difference between Epicurean and Cyrenaic
						ethics.</note> with regard to pleasure. They do not include under
						the term the pleasure which is a state of rest, but only that which
						consists in motion. Epicurus admits both ; also pleasure of mind as
						well as of body, as he states in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Choice
							and Avoidance</hi> and in that <hi rend='ital'>On the Ethical
								End</hi>, and in the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Human
									Life</hi> and in the epistle to his philosopher friends in
						Mytilene. So also Diogenes in the seventeenth book of his <hi
							rend='ital'>Epilecta</hi>, and Metrodorus in his <hi
								rend='ital'>Timocrates</hi>, whose actual words are : "Thus pleasure
						being conceived both as that species which consists in motion and
						that which is a state of rest." The words of Epicurus in his work
						<hi rend='ital'>On Choice</hi> are : "Peace of mind and freedom from
						pain are pleasures which imply a state of rest ; joy and delight are
						seen to consist in motion and activity."
					</p>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>
					<p>He further disagrees
						with the Cyrenaics in that they hold that pains of body are worse
						than mental pains ; at all events evil-doers are made to suffer
						bodily punishment ; whereas Epicurus holds the pains of the mind to
						be the worse ; at any rate the flesh endures the storms of the
						present alone, the mind those of the past and future as well as the
						present. In this way also he holds mental pleasures to be
					</p> <pb
						n='663'/> 
					<p>greater than those of the body. And as proof that
						pleasure is the end he adduces the fact that living things, so soon
						as they are born, are well content with pleasure and are at enmity
						with pain, by the prompting of nature and apart from reason. Left to
						our own feelings, then, we shun pain ; as when even Heracles,
						devoured by the poisoned robe, cries aloud,
					</p> 
					<p>And bites and
						yells, and rock to rock resounds,
					</p> 
					<p>Headlands of Locris and

					<milestone unit="section" n="138"/>
					<p>And we
						choose the virtues too on account of pleasure and not for their own
						sake, as we take medicine for the sake of health. So too in the
						twentieth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Epilecta</hi> says Diogenes,
						who also calls education <foreign lang='greek'>(a)gwgh/)</foreign>
						recreation <foreign lang='greek'>( diagwg h/)</foreign>. Epicurus
						describes virtue as the <hi rend='ital'>sine qua non</hi> of
						pleasure, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the one thing without which
						pleasure cannot be, everything else, food, for instance, being
						separable, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> not indispensable to
						pleasure.
					</p> 
					<p>Come, then, let me set the seal, so to say, on my
						entire work as well as on this philosopher's life by citing his
						Sovran Maxims,<note n='b'>This collection of forty of the most
							important articles of faith in the Epicurean creed was famous in
							antiquity. It consists of extracts from the voluminous writings of
							Epicurus, and may have been put together by a faithful disciple. On
							the other hand, Epicurus laid great stress (&sect;&sect;35, 36) on epitomes of
							his doctrine being committed to memory ; so that his passion for
							personal direction and supervision of the studies of his pupils may
							have induced him to furnish them with such an indispensable
							catechism.</note> therewith bringing the whole work to a close and

					<p>1. A blessed and eternal being has no trouble
						himself and brings no trouble upon any other being ; hence he is
						exempt from movements of anger and partiality, for every such
						movement implies weakness [<hi rend='ital'>Elsewhere he says that
							the gods are discernible by reason alone, some being numerically
							distinct, while others</hi>
					 <pb n='665'/> 
					<hi
						rend='ital'>result uniformly from the continuous influx of similar
						images directed to the same spot and in human form.</hi>]
					</p> 
					<p>2.
						Death is nothing to us ; for the body, when it has been resolved
						into its elements, has no feeling, and that which has no feeling is
						nothing to us.
					</p> 
					<p>3. The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit
						in the removal of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it
						is uninterrupted, there is no pain either of body or of mind or of
						both together.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="140"/>
					<p>4. Continuous pain does not last long in the
						flesh ; on the contrary, pain, if extreme, is present a very short
						time, and even that degree of pain which barely outweighs pleasure
						in the flesh does not last for many days together. Illnesses of long
						duration even permit of an excess of pleasure over pain in the
						flesh.
					</p> 
					<p>5. It is impossible to live a pleasant life without
						living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live
						wisely and well and justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any
						one of these is lacking, when, for instance, the man is not able to
						live wisely, though he lives well and justly, it is impossible for
						him to live a pleasant life.

					<p>6. In order to obtain security
						from other men any means whatsoever of procuring this was a natural
						good.<note n='a'>Usener, followed by Bignone, regards <foreign lang='greek'>a)rxh=s kai\ basile i/as</foreign> of the vulgate text as a

					</p>
					
					<p>7. Some men have sought to become famous and renowned, thinking
						that thus they would make themselves secure against their
						fellow-men. If, then, the life of such persons really was secure,
						they attained natural good ; if, however, it was insecure, they have
						not attained the end which by nature's own prompting they originally
						sought.
					</p> <pb n='667'/> 
					<p>8. No pleasure is in itself evil, but
						the things which produce certain pleasures entail annoyances many
						times greater than the pleasures themselves.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>
					<p>9. If all
						pleasure had been capable of accumulation,--if this had gone on
						not only by recurrence in time, but all over the frame or, at any
						rate, over the principal parts of man's nature, there would never
						have been any difference between one pleasure and another, as in
						fact there is.
					</p> 
					<p>10. If the objects which are productive of
						pleasures to profligate persons really freed them from fears of the
						mind,--the fears, I mean, inspired by celestial and atmospheric
						phenomena, the fear of death, the fear of pain ; if, further, they
						taught them to limit their desires, we should never have any fault
						to find with such persons, for they would then be filled with
						pleasures to overflowing on all sides and would be exempt from all
						pain, whether of body or mind, that is, from all evil.
					</p> 
					<p>11. If
						we had never been molested by alarms at celestial and atmospheric
						phenomena, nor by the misgiving that death somehow affects us, nor
						by neglect of the proper limits of pains and desires, we should have
						had no need to study natural science.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="143"/>
					<p>12. It would be
						impossible to banish fear on matters of the highest importance, if a
						man did not know the nature of the whole universe, but lived in
						dread of what the legends tell us. Hence without the study of nature
						there was no enjoyment of unmixed pleasures.
					</p> 
					<p>13. There would
						be no advantage in providing security against our fellow-men, so
						long as we were alarmed by occurrences over our heads or beneath the
						earth or in general by whatever happens in the boundless
						universe.
					</p> <pb n='669'/> 
					<p>14. When tolerable security against
						our fellow-men is attained, then on a basis of power sufficient to
						afford support<note n='a'>Or, if <foreign lang='greek'> e)coris
							tikh=|</foreign> be read (with Meib., Kochalsky, and Apelt, <hi
								rend='ital'>cf.</hi>&sect; 154), "power to expel."</note>and of material
						prosperity arises in most genuine form the security of a quiet
						private life withdrawn from the multitude.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="144"/>
					<p>15. Nature's
						wealth at once has its bounds and is easy to procure ; but the
						wealth of vain fancies recedes to an infinite distance.
					</p> 
					<p>16.
						Fortune but seldom interferes with the wise man ; his greatest and
						highest interests have been, are, and will be, directed by reason
						throughout the course of his life.
					</p> 
					<p>17. The just man enjoys
						the greatest peace of mind, while the unjust is full of the utmost
						disquietude.
					</p> 
					<p>18. Pleasure in the flesh admits no increase
						when once the pain of want has been removed ; after that it only
						admits of variation. The limit of pleasure in the mind, however, is
						reached when we reflect on the things themselves and their congeners
						which cause the mind the greatest alarms.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="145"/>
					<p>19. Unlimited time
						and limited time afford an equal amount of pleasure, if we measure
						the limits of that pleasure by reason.
					</p> 
					<p>20. The flesh receives
						as unlimited the limits of pleasure ; and to provide it requires
						unlimited time. But the mind, grasping in thought what the end and
						limit of the flesh is, and banishing the terrors of futurity,
						procures a complete and perfect life, and has no longer any need of
						unlimited time. Nevertheless it does not shun pleasure, and even
						in the
					 <pb n='671'/> 
					hour of death, when ushered out of
						existence by circumstances, the mind does not lack enjoyment of the
						best life.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="146"/>
					<p>21. He who understands the limits of life knows
						how easy it is to procure enough to remove the pain of want and make
						the whole of life complete and perfect. Hence he has no longer any
						need of things which are not to be won save by labour and
						conflict.
					</p> 
					<p>22. We must take into account as the end all that
						really exists and all clear evidence of sense to which we refer our
						opinions ; for otherwise everything will be full of uncertainty and
						confusion.
					</p> 
					<p>23. If you fight against all your sensations, you
						will have no standard to which to refer, and thus no means of
						judging even those judgements which you pronounce false.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="147"/>
					<p>24.
						If you reject absolutely any single sensation without stopping to
						discriminate with respect to that which awaits confirmation between
						matter of opinion and that which is already present, whether in
						sensation or in feelings or in any presentative perception of the
						mind, you will throw into confusion even the rest of your sensations
						by your groundless belief and so you will be rejecting the standard
						of truth altogether. If in your ideas based upon opinion you
						hastily affirm as true all that awaits confirmation as well as that
						which does not, you will not escape error, as you will be
						maintaining complete ambiguity whenever it is a case of judging
						between right and wrong opinion.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="148"/>
					<p>25. If you do not on every
						separate occasion refer each of your actions to the end prescribed
						by nature, but instead of this in the act of choice or avoidance
					
					<pb n='673'/> 
					swerve aside to some other end, your acts will not
						be consistent with your theories.
					</p> 
					<p>26. All such desires as
						lead to no pain when they remain ungratified are unnecessary, and
						the longing is easily got rid of, when the thing desired is
						difficult to procure or when the desires seem likely to produce
						harm.
					</p> 
					<p>27. Of all the means which are procured by wisdom to
						ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most
						important is the acquisition of friends.
					</p> 
					<p>28. The same
						conviction which inspires confidence that nothing we have to fear is
						eternal or even of long duration, also enables us to see that even
						in our limited conditions of life nothing enhances our security so
						much as friendship.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
					<p>29. Of our desires some are natural and
						necessary ; others are natural, but not necessary ; others, again,
						are neither natural nor necessary, but are due to illusory opinion.
						[Epicurus regards as natural and necessary desires which bring
						relief from pain, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> drink when we are
						thirsty ; while by natural and not necessary he means those which
						merely diversify the pleasure without removing the pain, as <hi
							rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> costly viands ; by the neither natural nor
						necessary he means desires for crowns and the erection of statues in
						one's honour.--Schol.]
					</p> 
					<p>30. Those natural desires which entail
						no pain when not gratified, though their objects are vehemently
						pursued, are also due to illusory opinion ; and when they are not
						got rid of, it is not because of their own nature, but because of
						the man's illusory opinion.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="150"/>
					<p>31. Natural justice is a symbol
						or expression of
					 <pb n='675'/> 
					expediency, to prevent one man
						from harming or being harmed by another.
					</p> 
					<p>32. Those animals
						which are incapable of making covenants with one another, to the end
						that they may neither inflict nor suffer harm, are without either
						justice or injustice. And those tribes which either could not or
						would not form mutual covenants to the same end are in like
						case.
					</p> 
					<p>33. There never was an absolute justice, but only an
						agreement made in reciprocal intercourse in whatever localities
						now and again from time to time, providing against the infliction or
						suffering of harm.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="151"/>
					<p>34. Injustice is not in itself an evil,
						but only in its consequence, viz. the terror which is excited by
						apprehension that those appointed to punish such offences will
						discover the injustice.
					</p> 
					<p>35. It is impossible for the man who
						secretly violates any article of the social compact to feel
						confident that he will remain undiscovered, even if he has already
						escaped ten thousand times ; for right on to the end of his life he
						is never sure he will not be detected.
					</p> 
					<p>36. Taken generally,
						justice is the same for all, to wit, something found expedient in
						mutual intercourse ; but in its application to particular cases of
						locality or conditions of whatever kind, it varies under different
						circumstances.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="152"/>
					<p>37. Among the things accounted just by conventional law, whatever in the needs of mutual intercourse is
						attested to be expedient, is thereby stamped as just, whether or not
						it be the same for all ; and in case any law is made and does not
						prove suitable to the expediencies of mutual intercourse, then this
						is
					 <pb n='677'/> 
					no longer just. And should the expediency
						which is expressed by the law vary and only for a time correspond
						with the prior conception, nevertheless for the time being it was
						just, so long as we do not trouble ourselves about empty words, but
						look simply at the facts.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="153"/>
					<p>38. Where without any change in
						circumstances the conventional laws, when judged by their consequences, were seen not to correspond with the notion of justice,
						such laws were not really just ; but wherever the laws have ceased
						to be expedient in consequence of a change in circumstances, in that
						case the laws were for the time being just when they were expedient
						for the mutual intercourse of the citizens, and subsequently ceased
						to be just when they ceased to be expedient.
					</p> 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="154"/>
					<p>39. He who best
						knew how to meet fear of external foes made into one family all the
						creatures he could ; and those he could not, he at any rate did not
						treat as aliens ; and where he found even this impossible, he
						avoided all intercourse, and, so far as was expedient, kept them
						at a distance.
					</p> 
					<p>40. Those who were best able to provide themselves with the means of security against their neighbours, being
						thus in possession of the surest guarantee, passed the most
						agreeable life in each other's society ; and their enjoyment of the
						fullest intimacy was such that, if one of them died before his time,
						the survivors did not lament his death as if it called for
						commiseration.
