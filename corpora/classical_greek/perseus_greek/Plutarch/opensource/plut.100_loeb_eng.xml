					The proof that afflictions of the soul are worse than

					which affect the body, yet, being itself afflicted with
					those of the soul, it can form no judgement of its
					own afflictions, for it is affected in the very part by
					which it judges ; and, of the souls diseases, one
					must account as first and greatest ignorance, which
					causes Vice beyond hope of cure to abide with most
					men, to cling to them through life, and to die with
					them. For the beginning of the riddance of disease
					is awareness which leads the ailing part to the use
					of what will relieve it; but the man who through
					disbelief in his ailment does not know what he needs,
					refuses the remedy, even if it be at hand. For it is
					true of the diseases of the body also that those are
					worse which are attended by inability to perceive the
					body's condition : lethargies, migraine, epilepsies,
					apoplexies, and those very fevers which, raising inflammation to the pitch of delirium and confounding

					It is true that one who is sick in body gives in at

					impulses. That is the reason why they do not allow
					the soul to be at rest, but just at the time when
					man most needs repose and silence and relaxation,
					then his fits of temper, of contentiousness, of love,
