					equally impossible to believe it to be the work of any full-grown man of sound mind.
					In this case, and in that of the next treatise, no satisfaction is gained by merely
					supposing the work spurious. One of these Parallel Histories is usually a well-known story, and the other is an absurd imitation of it. An instance may be seen
					in section 12, where the common story of Manlius Torquatus and his son is matched
					by an absurd one of Epaminondas and his son; on which Wyttenbach remarks:
					<q direct="unspecified">Romanum constat: Graecum non modo ementitum, sed stulte ementitum.</q> We
					might almost suspect that many of them are some school-boy's compositions, half historical, and half imitations of well-known stories fortified by imaginary authorities

					times for mere forgeries and fables, because of many passages in those relations that seem to be very extravagant.
					But yet, according to my observation, we have had as

					any we have received from antiquity; for proof whereof,
					I have here matched several stories of the ancients with
					modern instances, and cited my authorities.</p>
