            <head>ISIS AND OSIRIS
					(DE ISIDE ET OSIRIDE)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					Plutarch's knowledge of Egyptology was not profound. It is true that he once visited Egypt,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 678 c.</note> but how
					long he stayed and how much he learned we have no
					means of knowing. It is most likely that his treatise
					represents the knowledge current in his day, derived,
					no doubt, from two sources : books and priests. The
					gods of Egypt had early found a welcome in other
					lands, in Syria and Asia Minor, and later in Greece
					and Rome. That the worship of Isis had been introduced into Greece before 330 b.c. is certain from an
					inscription found in the Peiraeus (<hi rend="italics">I.G.</hi> II.<hi rend="super">1</hi> 168, or
					II.<hi rend="super">2</hi> 337 ; Dittenberger, <hi rend="italics">Sylloge</hi>
               <hi rend="super">3</hi>, 280, or 551<hi rend="super">2</hi>), in
					which the merchants from Citium ask permission to
					found a shrine of Aphrodite on the same terms as
					those on which the Egyptians had founded a shrine of
					Isis. In Delos there was a shrine of the Egyptian
					gods, and in Plutarch's own town they must have
					been honoured, for there have been found two dedications to Serapis, Isis, and Anubis,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Collitz, <hi rend="italics">Sammlung der griechischen Dialektinschriften</hi>, vol. i. pp. 149-155.</note> as well as numerous
					inscriptions recording the manumission of slaves,
					which in Greece was commonly accomplished by
					dedicating them to a god, who, in these inscriptions,
					is Serapis (Sarapis). An idea of the widespread
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.4"/>
					
					worship of Egyptian gods in Greek lands may be
					obtained from Roscher, <hi rend="italics">Ausf&uuml;hrliches Lexikon der griechischen und romischen Mythologie</hi>, vol. ii. pp. 379-392,
					where the cults of Isis are listed.
				</p>
            <p>
					Another source of information available to Plutarch
					was books. Herodotus in the fifth century b.c. had
					visited Egypt, and he devoted a large part of the
					second book of his History to the manners and
					customs of the Egyptians. Plutarch, however, draws
					but little from him. Some of the information that
					Plutarch gives us may be found also in Diodorus
					Siculus, principally in the first book, but a little also
					in the second. Aelian and, to a less extent, other
					writers mentioned in the notes on the text, have
					isolated fragments of information which usually agree
					with Plutarch and Diodorus. All this points to the
					existence of one or more books, now lost, which contained this information, possibly in a systematic form.
					As a result, Plutarch has many things right and some
					wrong. Those who are interested in these matters
					may consult Erman-Grapow, <hi rend="italics">W&ouml;rterbuch der &auml;gyptischen Sprache</hi> (Leipzig, 1925-1929), and G. Parthey's
					edition of the <hi rend="italics">Isis and Osiris</hi> (Berlin, 1850).
				</p>
            <p>
					One matter which will seem very unscientific to the
					modern reader is Plutarch's attempts to explain the
					derivation of various words, especially his attempt to
					derive Egyptian words from Greek roots ; but in this
					respect he sins no more than Plato, who has given
					us some most atrocious derivations of Greek words,
					especially in the <hi rend="italics">Cratylus</hi>; nor is it more disastrous
					than Herodotus's industrious attempts (in Book II)
					to derive all manner of Greek customs, ritual, and
					theology from Egypt.
				</p>
            <p>
					In spite of minor errors contained in the <hi rend="italics">Isis and</hi>
					
					          <pb id="v.5.p.5"/>
					
					          <hi rend="italics">Osiris</hi>, no other work by a Greek writer is more
					frequently referred to by Egyptologists except,
					possibly, Herodotus. Connected information may,
					of course, be found in histories of Egypt, such as
					those of Breasted and Baikie.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">All the Greek and Roman sources for the religion of the Egyptians will be found conveniently collected in Hopfner, <hi rend="italics">Fontes Historiae Religionis Aegyptiacae</hi>, Parts I. and II. (Bonn, 1922-1923).</note>
				        </p>
            <p>
					The work is dedicated to Clea, a cultured and
					intelligent woman, priestess at Delphi, to whom
					Plutarch dedicated also his book on the <hi rend="italics">Bravery of
					Women</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 242 e - 263 c, contained in vol. iii. of
					L.C.L. pp. 473-581). It is, no doubt, owing to this
					that the author, after he has unburdened himself of
					his information on Egyptology, goes on to make some
					very sane remarks on the subject of religion and the
					proper attitude in which to approach it. This part
					of the essay ranks with the best of Plutarch's writing.
					The Ms. tradition of the essay is bad, as may be
					seen from the variations found in the few passages
					quoted by later writers such as Eusebius and Stobaeus;
					yet much has been done by acute scholars to make
					the text more intelligible. It may not be invidious
					to mention among those who have made special contributions to the study of this work W. Baxter, who
					translated it (1684), and S. Squire, who edited it
					(1744). Many other names will be found in the
					critical notes.
				</p>
            <p>
					The essay is No. 118 in Lamprias's list of Plutarch's
					works, where the title is given as an account of Isis
					and Serapis.

            <p>Therefore the effort to arrive at the Truth, and
					especially the truth about the gods, is a longing for
					the divine. For the search for truth requires for its

					subjects, and it is a work more hallowed than any

					of all, it is well-pleasing to that goddess whom you

					reasoning about the gods ; and nothing has a greater

					until they were brought into open hostility with one
					another. Even to-day the inhabitants of Lycopolis
					are the only people among the Egyptians that eat

            <p>If, then, the most noted of the philosophers,
					observing the riddle of the Divine in inanimate and incorporeal objects, have not thought it proper to treat
					any thing with carelessness or disrespect, even more do
					I think that, in all likelihood, we should welcome those
					peculiar properties existent in natures which possess
					the power of perception and have a soul and feeling
					and character. It is not that we should honour these,
					but that through these we should honour the Divine,
					since they are the clearer mirrors of the Divine by
					their nature also, so that we should regard them as
					the instrument or device of the God who orders all
					things. And in general we must hold it true that
					nothing inanimate is superior to what is animate, ana
					nothing without the power of perception is superior
					to that which has that power - no, not even if one
					should heap together all the gold and emeralds in the
					world. The Divine is not engendered in colours or in
					forms or in polished surfaces, but whatsoever things
					have no share in life, things whose nature does not
					allow them to share therein, have a portion of less
					honour than that of the dead. But the nature that
					lives and sees and has within itself the source of
					movement and a knowledge of what belongs to it and
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.181"/>

					Wherefore the Divine is no worse represented in
					these animals than in works of bronze and stone which

					bring relief to pestilential affections by making a large
