            <head>LIVES OF THE TEN ORATORS (VITAE DECEM ORATORUM) <lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					At some time in the second century before Christ
					ten Attic orators were selected, probably by Apollodorus of Pergamum, as the orators whose speeches
					were most worthy of preservation and study, and
					this <q direct="unspecified">Canon</q> of the Ten Attic Orators was generally
					accepted. The <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi> of these orators which are
					contained in manuscripts of Plutarch's <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi> were
					certainly not written by Plutarch. They are altogether lacking in the charm which characterizes
					Plutarch's careful and elaborate style. Facts are
					stated one after another with little variety and with
					little or no distinction between mere anecdotes and
					matters of real importance ; but the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi> are of
					interest on account of their subject matter.
				</p>
            <p>
					The <q direct="unspecified">decrees</q> appended to the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi> are, except
					in some details, fairly accurate copies of official
					documents (see F. Ladek, <hi rend="italics">Wiener Studien</hi>, xiii., 1891,
					pp. Ill ff.). The two which are concerned with
					Demosthenes and his family are not really decrees,
					but petitions addressed to the Senate, copies of
					which were undoubtedly kept among the official
					records at Athens, whereas the third - that in honour
					of Lycurgus - is a decree of the people. A large part
					of the inscription recording this decree has been
					found and is published in the <hi rend="italics">Inscriptiones Graecae</hi>, ii.
					No. 240 (editio minor, ii. No. 457), Dittenberger,
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.343"/>
					
					          <hi rend="italics">Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum</hi>, third edition, No. 326.
					The text which has been handed down in the manuscripts of Plutarch varies somewhat from that of the
					inscription, but hardly more than is to be expected.
					It may well be that whoever appended the <q direct="unspecified">decrees</q>
					to the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi> of the orators derived them, not directly
					from inscriptions or other official documents, but (as
					suggested by B. Keil in <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, xxx. pp. 210 ff.) from
					the work of Heliodorus <hi rend="italics">On Monuments</hi>.
				</p>
            <p>
					The <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi>, with the <q direct="unspecified">decrees,</q> are published by
					Anton Westermann in his <hi rend="italics">Biographi Graeci</hi> (1833 and
					1845).

            <head>I. ANTIPHON</head>
            <p>
					Antiphon was the son of Sophilus, and his deme
					was Rhamnus. He was a pupil of his father (for his
					father was a sophist, and it is said that Alcibiades
					as a boy attended his school), and having acquired
					power in speaking - as some think, through his own
					natural ability - he entered upon a public career.
					And he set up a school and had his disagreement with
					Socrates on the subject of words, not in a contentious
					spirit, but for the sake of argument, as Xenophon
					has narrated in his <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi>.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Memorabilia</hi>, i. 6.</note> And he wrote some
					speeches for citizens who wanted them for their
					suits in the law-courts, being the first who practised
					this profession, as some say. At any rate no legal
					oration is extant of any of those who lived before
					his time, nor of his contemporaries either, because
					the custom of speech-writing had not yet arisen ;
					there is none by Themistocles, Aristeides, or Pericles,
					although the times afforded them many opportunities
					and also occasions when such speeches were needed.
					And it was not for lack of ability that they refrained
					from such speech-writing, as is evident from what
					is said by the historians about each of the abovementioned orators. Yet all those whom we are able
					to record as having practised this kind of speeches,
					going back to the earliest occurrence, will be found
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.347"/>
					
					
					to have followed Antiphon when he was already old;
					I mean such as Alcibiades, Critias, Lysias, and
					Archinus. He was also the first to publish rules of
					the art of oratory, being of sharp intellect, and for
					this reason he was nicknamed Nestor.
				</p>
            <p>
					And Caecilius, in the treatise he compiled about
					him, conjectures from the terms in which Antiphon
					is praised in the work of the historian Thucydides
					that he was the latter's teacher.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Thucydides, viii. 68 <foreign lang="greek">a)nh\r *)aqhnai/wn tw=n kaq' e(auto\n a)reth=| te ou)deno\s deu/teros kai\ kra/tistos e)nqumhqh=nai geno/menos kai\ a(\ gnoi/h ei)pei=n</foreign>, <q direct="unspecified">a man inferior to none of the Athenians of his own day in force of character, and one who had proved himself most able both to formulate a plan and to set forth his conclusions in speech</q> (Smith's translation, L.C.L.).</note> In his speeches
					he is accurate and persuasive, clever in invention,
					ingenious in handling perplexing cases; he attacks
					unexpectedly, and he addresses his arguments to
					both the laws and the emotions, aiming especially at
					propriety. He was born at the time of the Persian
					wars and of the sophist Gorgias, who was somewhat
					older than he ; and his life extended until the destruction of the democracy by the Four Hundred,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">In 411 b.c. when for some four months an oligarchy ruled Athens.</note>
					in causing which he seems himself to have had a

					another by being general<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Antiphon was a common name at Athens in the fifth century. Blass, <hi rend="italics">Die attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, 2nd ed. i. pp. 93 ff., distinguishes, in addition to the orator: (1) a patriotic and worthy citizen (Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Hell.</hi> ii. 3. 40) in defence of whose daughter Lysias wrote a speech, and to whom the military activities belong which are here ascribed to the orator; (2) the tragic poet who was put to death by Dionysius of Syracuse (Aristotle, <hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi> ii. 6. p. 1385 a 9); (3) Antiphon the sophist (Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Mem.</hi> i. 6. 5; Diog. Laert. ii. 5. 25), who is probably the one who practised mental healing at Corinth; (4) the son of Pyrilampus (Plato, <hi rend="italics">Parmenides</hi>, 127 a); (5) the son of Lysonides (<hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 833 a); and (6) an Antiphon derided by Aristophanes (<hi rend="italics">Wasps</hi>, 1270), as a starveling. The Pseudo-Plutarch has evidently fused several of these personalities with that of the orator.</note> and gaining many victories
					in battle and winning important alliances for the

					by manning sixty triremes, and by being on every
					occasion their envoy to Lacedaemon at the time
					when E&euml;tioneia had been fortified.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">E&euml;tioneia, the mole which formed the northern side of the great Harbour of Peiraeus, was fortified by the Four Hundred in order to command the entrance.</note> And after the
					overthrow of the Four Hundred he was indicted along
					with Archeptolemus, one of the Four Hundred, was
					found guilty, subjected to the punishments prescribed for traitors, thrown out unburied, and inscribed along with his descendants in the list of the
					disfranchised. But some tell us that he was put to
					death by the Thirty,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">In 404 b.c., when Athens was occupied by the Lacedaemonians, a body of Thirty men was appointed to revise the constitution. They seized all power and ruled ruthlessly until overthrown in May 403 b.c.</note> as Lysias says in his speech
					in defence of Antiphon's daughter ; for he had a
					daughter whom Callaeschrus claimed in marriage by
					legal process. And that he was put to death by the
					Thirty is told also by Theopompus in the fifteenth
					book of his <hi rend="italics">Philippics</hi>
               <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italics">Frag. Hist. Graec.</hi> i. p. 300.</note>; but that must have been
					another Antiphon, the son of Lysidonides, whom
					Cratinus also, in his play <hi rend="italics">The Flask</hi>, mentions as a
					rascal; for how could a man who had died previously
					and had been put to death by the Four Hundred be
					living again in the time of the Thirty ? But there is
					also another story of his death : that he sailed as
					envoy to Syracuse when the tyranny of Dionysius
					the First was at its height, and at a convivial gathering the question arose what bronze was the best ;
					then when most of the guests disagreed, he said
					that bronze was the best from which the statues of
					Harmodius and Aristogeiton were made ; and when
					Dionysius heard this, suspecting that the remark
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.351"/>
					
					
					was intended to encourage an attack upon himself,
					he ordered that Antiphon be put to death. But
					others say that he was angry because Antiphon made
					fun of his tragedies.
				</p>
            <p>
					There are current sixty orations ascribed to this
					orator, twenty-five of which Caecilius says are
					spurious. He is ridiculed as a lover of money by
					Plato in his <hi rend="italics">Peisander</hi>.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Kock, <hi rend="italics">Com. Att. Frag.</hi> i. p. 629, no. 103.</note> And he is said to have
					written tragedies both by himself and in collaboration
					with the tyrant Dionysius. But while he was still
					busy with poetry he invented a method of curing
					distress, just as physicians have a treatment for those
					who are ill; and at Corinth, fitting up a room near
					the market-place, he wrote on the door that he
					could cure by words those who were in distress ; and
					by asking questions and finding out the causes of
					their condition he consoled those in trouble. But
					thinking this art was unworthy of him he turned to
					oratory. There are some who ascribe also to Antiphon the book <hi rend="italics">On Poets</hi> by Glaucus of Rhegium.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italics">Frag. Hist. Graec.</hi> ii. p. 23.</note>
					His most admired orations are the one concerning
					Herodes, that against Erasistratus about the peacocks, that on the Indictment, which he wrote in his
					own defence, and that against the general Demosthenes for moving an illegal measure. He wrote
					also a speech against the general Hippocrates and
					caused him to be convicted by default.

            <p>
					Caecilius has appended a decree passed in the
					archonship of Theopompus,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">411-410 b.c. Caecilius derived his text of the decree from Craterus's collection of decrees. See Harpocration, <hi rend="italics">s.v.</hi>

					Four Hundred were overthrown, according to which
					the senate voted the trial of Antiphon :
					<quote rend="blockquote">Voted by the senate on the twenty-first day of the

					detriment of the State of the Athenians while serving as
					envoys to Lacedaemon and for sailing from the camp
					in a ship of the enemy and for having passed by land
					through Deceleia, namely Archeptolemus, Onomacles, and
					Antiphon, that they be arrested and brought before the

					Andocides was the son of Leogoras, son of that

					traces its origin to him. On this account, too, he
					was once chosen along with Glaucon to go with
					twenty ships to aid the Corcyraeans who were embroiled with the Corinthians.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Thucydides, i. 51, who seems to have been the source of this error. The colleague of Glaucon on this expedition was Dracontides, son of Leogoras of Thurae, and not Andocides, who at the time, 433 b.c., was too young. See <hi rend="italics">I. G.</hi> i. 295 (ed. min.), and Kirchner, <hi rend="italics">Prosopographia Attica</hi>, 828 and 4551.</note> And after this he
					was accused of impiety as being one of those who
					mutilated the Hermae<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The Hermae, square pillars surmounted by the head of the god Hermes, stood before the doors of Athenian houses. In 415 b.c., just as the great expedition against Sicily was about to sail, these Hermae were systematically mutilated in the night by unknown persons.</note> and as profaning the mysteries of Demeter [because at an earlier time he was

					dissipated and in a nocturnal revel had broken one
					of the images of the god, and when he was indicted
					refused to surrender the slave whom his accusers
					were looking for, so that he gained a bad name and
					was suspected and accused in the second suit also,
					which was brought shortly after the expedition went
					to Sicily, when the Corinthians sent in men from
					Leontini and Egesta and, as the Athenians hesitated
					about aiding them privately, they mutilated the
					Hermae about the market-place, as Cratippus says,
					and profaned the mysteries besides]. At his trial
					on these charges he was acquitted on condition that
					he should inform against the wrongdoers. He
					exerted himself greatly and discovered those who
					were guilty of the sacrilege, among whom he informed against his own father. And he brought
					about the conviction and death of all the others, but
					saved his father, although he had already been put
					in prison, by promising that he would be of great
					service to the city. And he kept his promise ; for
					Leogoras caused the conviction of many men who
					were embezzling public funds and committing other
					misdeeds. And for these reasons he was acquitted
					of the charge.
				</p>
            <p>
					But Andocides, since his reputation in public life
					was not good, took to merchandising and became a
					friend of the Cypriote kings and many other men of
					note, at which time he abducted a girl of Athenian
					birth, daughter of Aristeides and his own niece,
					without the knowledge of her family, and sent her as
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.359"/>
					
					
					a gift to the King of Cyprus. Then, when he was to be
					brought to trial for this, he stole her back again from
					Cyprus and was caught and put in prison by the king ;
					but he ran away and came back to Athens at the
					time when the Four Hundred were in control of
					affairs. He was put in prison by them, but escaped,
					and again, when the oligarchy was overthrown, he
					. . . was banished from the city after the Thirty had
					taken over the government. He spent the period

					Isocrates was the son of Theodorus of Erchia, a
					citizen of the middle class, an owner of slaves who
					made flutes, through whom he gained a competence,
					so that he paid for a public chorus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Wealthy Athenians performed in turn special services to the state called <q direct="unspecified">liturgies.</q> The most expensive of these was the choregy, which involved the payment, training, and equipment of a chorus for a lyrical or dramatic performance.</note> and gave his

					hence he is ridiculed on account of the flutes by
					Aristophanes and Strattis. Isocrates was born in
					the eighty-sixth Olympiad, in the archonship of
					Lysimachus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">436-435 b.c.</note> of Myrrhinus, being twenty-two years
					younger than Lysias and seven years older than
					Plato.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato was born in 428-427 b.c. Lysias, according to this statement, in 459-458. But see note on 835 d above.</note> In his boyhood he was as well educated as
					any Athenian, for he attended the lectures of Prodicus of Ceos, Gorgias of Leontini, Teisias of Syracuse,
					and the orator Theramenes ; and when the lastnamed was in danger of being arrested by the Thirty
					and had fled for safety to the altar of Hestia Boulaea,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The sanctuary of this Goddess of the Senate's Hearth was in or near the Prytaneum, which was somewhere on the northern slope of the Acropolis.</note>
					everyone else was terrified, but Isocrates alone arose
					to speak in his aid; and at first he was silent for a long
					time, then afterwards he was urged to be silent by
					Theramenes himself, who said that his misfortune
					would be more painful if any of his friends should
					share it. And it is said that certain rhetorical teachings of Theramenes - those which go under the name
					of Boton - were of use to Isocrates when he was
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.373"/>
					
					
					falsely accused in the courts. But when he became
					a man he kept away from political affairs, since he had
					a weak voice and a timid disposition<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See Isocrates, <hi rend="italics">Philip</hi> (Or. v.), 81; <hi rend="italics">Panathenaic</hi> (Or. xii.), 9.</note> and had lost his
					inherited property in the war against the Lacedaemonians. It is evident that he composed speeches
					for others, but he delivered only one, that on the
					Exchange of Property. He set up a school and turned
					to philosophy and to writing out the results of his
					thinking, and he composed his Festival Oration<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Panegyric</hi>, delivered at Olympia.</note> and
					some others of an advisory nature, some of which he
					delivered himself and some of which he prepared for
					others to deliver, hoping that in this way he might
					lead the Greeks to think as they ought. But when
					he failed of his purpose he gave up that sort of thing
					and became the head of a school, at first, as some say,
					at Chios, where he had nine pupils. That was the
					time when, as he saw the tuition fees counted out,
					he burst into tears and said, <q direct="unspecified">Now I recognize that I
						have sold myself to these people.</q> He would carry
					on conversation with all who desired it and was the
					first to make a distinction between contentious
					speeches and those of a political character, to which
					latter he devoted himself. And he also instituted at
					Chios public offices and the same constitution which
					existed in his native city. He made more money
					than any other sophist, so that he was even a trierarch.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The trierarchy was one of the <q direct="unspecified">liturgies</q> which wealthy citizens were obliged to perform. Being trierarch thus showed wealth.</note>

					His pupils numbered about one hundred, including
					among many others Timothe&uuml;s, son of Conon, with
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.375"/>
					
					
					whom he visited many cities ; and he composed the
					letters which Timothe&uuml;s sent to the Athenians, on

					Phaselis, who afterwards wrote tragedies and whose
					monument stood as you go to the Bean-market along
					the Sacred Way which leads to Eleusis ; it is now in
					ruins. There, too, were set up statues of the famous
					poets along with his ; of these only the poet Homer
					exists now. And Leodamas the Athenian and
					Lacritus the Athenian law-maker and, as some say,
					Hypereides and Isaeus were his pupils. And they
					say that while he was still teaching oratory Demosthenes came to him eager to learn and said that he
					could not pay the thousand drachmas which he asked
					as tuition fee, but would give two hundred for one
					fifth of the instruction ; whereupon Isocrates replied :
					<q direct="unspecified">We do not cut our instruction into bits, Demosthenes, but just as people sell fine fish whole, so, if

					to come the next day, since now the lecture-room had
					a full audience. And he used to say to his pupils that

            <head>VII. LYCURGUS</head>
            <p>
					Lycurgus was the son of Lycophron and grandson of the Lycurgus whom the Thirty Tyrants put to
					death, his execution being brought about by Aristodemus
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.397"/>
					
					
					of Bat&ecirc;, who also, after having been one of the
					Hellenotamiae,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The Hellenotamiae were a board of ten members who collected and administered the tribute paid to Athens by the members of the Delian Confederacy.</note> was banished under the democracy.
					Lycurgus was of the deme of the Butadae and the
					family of the Eteobutadae. He attended the
					lectures of Plato the philosopher and at first devoted
					himself to philosophy ; then, after being a pupil of
					the orator Isocrates, he had a notable public career
					both as a speaker and as a man of action, and he was
					also entrusted with the management of the finances
					of the State ; for he was made treasurer for three
					periods of four years<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">338-326 b.c. The title of his office is not known. No regular office so extensive as this is mentioned in Aristotle's <hi rend="italics">Constitution of Athens</hi>. He may have been in charge of the theoric fund or the military fund, or both, by virtue of a special commission, which in the next generation became a regular office; see Ferguson, <hi rend="italics">Hellenistic Athens</hi>, p. 10, Tarn, <hi rend="italics">Cambridge Ancient History</hi>, vi. p. 441. The period meant may be the quinquennium.</note> in charge of fourteen thousand
					talents, or, as some say (and among them the man
					who proposed the vote of honours for him,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See Decree III, below, 852.</note> Stratocles
					the orator), eighteen thousand, six hundred and
					fifty.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Roughly equivalent to £3,026,000 or $15,130,000, or more at present values.</note> He was elected in his own person the first
					time, but afterwards he entered the name of one of
					his friends, though he himself administered the office,
					because a law had previously been introduced forbidding anyone elected treasurer of the public funds
					to hold the office more than four years ; and he was
					always intent upon the public business summer and
					winter. When he was elected to provide munitions
					of war he restored many edifices in the city, he
					provided four hundred triremes for the people, he constructed the gymnasium in the Lyceum and planted
					trees in it, he built the palaestra and finished the
					Dionysiac theatre when he was the commissioner
					in charge of that work.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Probably while he was in control of the finances. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> D&ouml;rpfeld and Reisch, <hi rend="italics">Das griechische Theater</hi>, pp. 39 f.</note> He took care of two hundred
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.399"/>
					
					
					and fifty talents entrusted to him on deposit by
					private persons, he provided for the city objects of
					gold and silver for use in processions and golden
					Victories, and many buildings which came into his
					hands half-finished he completed, among them the
					ship-sheds and the arsenal. And he put the foundation-walls round the Panathenaic stadium. This he
					accomplished, and also the levelling of the ravine,
					because a certain Deinias who owned this plot of
					land gave it to the city when Lycurgus suggested to
					him that he make the gift.
				</p>
            <p>
					He was charged also with guarding the city and
					arresting malefactors, whom he drove out entirely,
					so that some of the sophists said that Lycurgus
					signed warrants against evil-doers with a pen dipped,
					not in ink, but in death. And therefore, when King
					Alexander demanded his surrender, the people did
					not give him up. When Philip was carrying on the
					second war with the Athenians, Lycurgus went as
					envoy with Polyeuctus and Demosthenes to the
					Peloponnesus and to some other States. Throughout
					his life he was always highly esteemed among the
					Athenians and considered a just man, so that in the
					courts of law the word of Lycurgus was regarded as
					a help to anyone requiring an advocate.
				</p>
            <p>
					He also introduced laws : the law relating to
					comic actors, that a competitive performance be held
					on the festival of Pots<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The third day of the Anthesteria, the thirteenth day of the month Anthesterium.</note> and that the victor's name

					which had not been permitted before, and thus he
					revived a contest which had fallen out of use ; the
					law that bronze statues of the poets Aeschylus,
					Sophocles, and Euripides be erected, that their
					tragedies be written out and kept in a public depository, and that the clerk of the State read them to the
					actors who were to perform their plays for comparison of the texts and that it be unlawful to depart
					from the authorized text in acting ; a third law that

					should be held in Peiraeus, consisting of no fewer than

               <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The story may well be apocryphal.

					decrees. And although he was well-to-do, he wore

					on sandals only on days when they wTere necessary.
					He studied night and day, since he had no natural
					gift for extemporaneous speaking, and he lay on a
					cot with only a sheepskin and a pillow on it, so that
					he might wake up easily and study. When someone
					found fault with him for paying money to sophists

					that if anyone would promise to make his sons better,
					he would pay him, not thousands only, but half his

					Thucydides and also the philosopher Plato, whose
					instruction, some say, he followed with especial zeal.
					But Hegesias of Magnesia says that he asked his

					for it was by swearing in this way that he had caused

					being admitted, but after he had entered the harbour,
					Demosthenes accepted one thousand darics and
					changed his attitude, and when the Athenians wished
					to surrender the man to Antipater, he spoke against
					it and made a motion that Harpalus deposit the money
					on the Acropolis without even stating the amount to
					the people ; and although Harpalus stated that he
					had brought with him seven hundred talents, that
					which was taken up to the Acropolis was found to
					amount to only three hundred and fifty or a little
					more, as Philochorus says. And after this, when
					Harpalus escaped from the prison in which he was
					being kept until a representative of Alexander should
					arrive, and had gone to Crete or, as some say, to
					Taenarum in Laconia, Demosthenes was accused of
					bribe-taking and of having this reason for not mentioning the amount of the money taken up or the
					carelessness of the guard. He was brought to trial
					by Hypereides, Pytheas, Menesaechmus, Himeraeus,
					and Patrocles, and they obtained his conviction by
					the Senate of the Areopagus ; and after his conviction he went into exile, not being able to pay back
					five times the amount (he was accused of having
					accepted thirty talents), or, as some say, he did not
					wait for the trial. After this time the Athenians
					sent Polyeuctus as envoy to the commonwealth of the
					Arcadians in order to detach them from their alliance
					with the Macedonians, and when Polyeuctus was
					unable to persuade them, Demosthenes appeared to
					help him and did persuade them. For this he was
					admired, and after some time he was permitted to
					return, a decree in his favour having been passed

					Sixty-five genuine speeches of Demosthenes are

					derived from the name of his nurse and was given to

					him once in a tavern looking ashamed and trying to
					withdraw from sight, said, <q direct="unspecified">The more you withdraw,
						the more you will be in the tavern.</q> And he jeered
					at him, saying that in his speeches he was a Scythian,
					but in battle a city man. He received money from
					Ephialtes also, one of the politicians, who had been
					on an embassy to the King of Persia and came
					secretly bringing funds for distribution among the
					politicians for the purpose of stirring up the war
					against Philip ; and they say that he received a
					private bribe of three thousand darics from the King.
					He arrested a certain Anaxilas of Oreus, who had been
					a guest-friend of his, subjected him to torture as a
					spy, and when he confessed nothing proposed a decree
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.435"/>
					
					
					that he be handed over to the executioners. And
					once when he was being prevented by the Athenians
					from speaking in the assembly, he said that he only
					wished to speak briefly to them, and when they became silent he said, <q direct="unspecified">A young man in the summer

						the ass that he had complete rights in him.</q> When
					he had said this, he began to go away ; and when the

					Hypereides was the son of Glaucippus and grandson of Dionysius, of the deme of Collyt&ecirc;. He had a

					was an orator and writer of speeches.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">In the Athenian courts of law the parties to a suit were obliged to speak in person, therefore those who were not sure of their own ability hired others to write their speeches, which they learned by heart and delivered.</note> He in turn

					philosopher Plato, along with Lycurgus, and of the
					orator Isocrates, Hypereides entered upon public life
					at Athens at the time when Alexander was interfering in the affairs of Greece. And he spoke in
					opposition to him concerning the generals whose
					surrender he demanded of the Athenians and concerning the triremes. He also advised against
					disbanding the mercenary force at Taenarum under
					the command of Chares, since he was well disposed
					towards that general. At first he pleaded in suits at
					law in return for a fee. And since he was believed to

					when others were released from all contributions to the
					public service. He also proposed honours for Demosthenes, and when suit was brought by Diondas on the
					ground that the decree was contrary to law, he was
					acquitted. Although he was a friend of Demosthenes, Lysicles, Lycurgus, and their associates, he
					did not remain so to the end ; but when Lysicles and
					Lycurgus were dead and Demosthenes was being
					tried for receiving bribes from Harpalus, he was
					chosen from all the orators (for he alone was unbribed)
					and brought the accusation against him. And when
					he was brought to trial by Aristogeiton for illegal
					conduct in proposing a decree after the battle of
					Chaeroneia to grant citizenship to the resident aliens,
					to set the slaves free, and to put the sacred objects,
					the children, and the women in Peiraeus for safekeeping, he was acquitted. And when certain

					month of Pyanepsion. But Hermippus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italics">Frag. Hist. Graec.</hi> i. p. 50.</note> says that he

					by the people in the archonship of Diocles,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">288-287 b.c.</note> he first reduced
					the expenses of the administration and was sparing of the
					public resources; he went as envoy to Lysimachus and
					secured for the people thirty talents of silver and again one
					hundred more ; he proposed the sending of an embassy to
					Ptolemy in Egypt, and those who took part in it brought
					back for the people fifty talents of silver; he was envoy to
					Antipater and secured twenty talents of silver which he
					brought to Eleusis for the people. He won the assent of the
					people to all these measures and accomplished them ; he was
					exiled for the sake of the democracy, he took no part in any
					oligarchy, he held no office after the democracy had been
					overthrown, and he was the only Athenian of those who were
					engaged in public life in his time who never plotted to alter
					the government of the country by changing it to a form other
					than democracy; he made the decisions of the courts, the
					laws, the courts, and property, safe for all Athenians by
					the policy he pursued, and he never did anything adverse to
					the democracy by word or deed.

					Lycophron, son of Lycurgus, of the deme Butadae, presented in writing a claim for maintenance in the Prytaneum
					for himself in accordance with the gift presented by the
					people to Lycurgus of the deme Butadae. In the archonship
					of Anaxicrates,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">307-306 b.c. Much of the substance of this document is contained in the <hi rend="italics">Life</hi> of Lycurgus, see pp. 395 ff. above.</note> in the sixth prytany, that of the tribe
					Antiochis, Stratocles, son of Euthydemus, of the deme
					Diomeia, made the following motion: Whereas Lycurgus,
					son of Lycophron, of the deme Butadae, having inherited
					from early times from his ancestors that loyalty to the
					democracy which has been peculiar to his family, and the
					progenitors of Lycurgus, Lycomedes and Lycurgus, were
					not only honoured by the people during their lives, but also
					after their death the people granted them for their courage
					and virtue public burials in the Cerameicus ; and whereas
					Lycurgus himself during his public career made many
					excellent laws for his country, and when he was treasurer of
					the public revenues of the city for three periods of four years
					distributed from the public revenue eighteen thousand nine
					hundred talents ; and having received in trust large funds
					from private citizens, from which he made loans previously
					agreed upon in order to meet the exigencies of the city
					and the people, in all six hundred and fifty talents ; and,
					because he was believed to have administered all these funds
					justly, was often crowned by the State ; and whereas when
					chosen by the people he brought together large sums of
					money upon the Acropolis, providing adornment for the
					Goddess, solid gold Victories, gold and silver vessels for the
					processions, and ornaments of gold for one hundred basket-carriers,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Maidens of good birth who carried baskets of offerings in the processions.</note> and when chosen to be in charge of the equipment for
					the war he brought to the Acropolis many pieces of armour
					and fifty thousand missiles and fitted out four hundred
					triremes ready to set sail, providing the equipment for some
					of them and causing some to be built from the beginning;
					
					<pb id="v.10.p.457"/>
					
					
					and besides all this he finished the ship-sheds and the arsenal,
					which were half done when they came into his hands, and
					completed the Panathenaic stadium and erected the gymnasium at the Lyceum, and adorned the city with many
					other edifices. And when King Alexander, after overthrowing all Asia, assumed to give orders to all the Greeks in
					common and demanded that Lycurgus be surrendered because
					he was acting in opposition to him, the city did not surrender
					him in spite of fear of Alexander. And although he had
					many times submitted his accounts while the city was free
					and had a democratic form of government, he never was
					convicted of wrongdoing or of taking bribes through all his
					career. Therefore, that all may know that those who choose
					to act justly in public life in behalf of democracy and freedom
					are held in the highest esteem while living and receive after
					death enduring gratitude: With good Fortune: Be it resolved
					by the people to commend Lycurgus, son of Lycophron, of
					the deme Butadae, for his virtue and justice, and to set up
					a bronze statue of him in the Market-place, only not in
					any place where the law forbids its erection, and to grant
					maintenance in the Prytaneum to the eldest descendant of
					Lycurgus for all time, and that all his decrees be valid, and
					that the secretary of the people inscribe them on stone
					tablets arid place them on the Acropolis near the dedicatory
					offerings; and that the treasurer of the people give for
					inscribing the tablets fifty drachmas from the funds expended
					by the people for decrees.
