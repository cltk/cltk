					PARALLEL STORIES

					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					The <hi rend="italics">Greek and Roman Parallel Stories</hi> (sometimes called
					the <hi rend="italics">Parallela Minora</hi>) are a puzzle. The use of some
					strange and barbarous forms, the substitution of <q direct="unspecified">the
						aforesaid</q>
               <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">On <foreign lang="greek">proeirhme/nos</foreign> see W. Schmid, <hi rend="italics">Der Atticismus</hi>, iii. pp. 147 ff.</note> for the usual pronoun of reference (though
					this is, to be sure, a prominent characteristic of the
					work of Polybius), and above all the atrocious style in
					which the work is written make it impossible that
					this could reasonably be regarded as the work of
					Plutarch,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Contrariwise see Parthenius, translated by S. Gaselee, in the L.C.L. p. 289 note.</note> though some scholars, fortunately unknown to Hartman, have actually regarded this work
					as one of the sins of Plutarch's otherwise stainless
					youth.
				</p>
            <p>Yet a work of this name is included in Lamprias's
					list, No. 128 under the title <foreign lang="greek">*dihgh/seis *para/llhloi
					*(ellhnikai\ kai\ *(rwmai+kai/</foreign> and several of these tales
					are quoted in full<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Only the first, however, is assigned to Plutarch.</note> in almost the exact words of our
					ms. text by Joannes Stobaeus. But the excessive
					ineptitude of the language quite excludes the possibility that the work before us can be Plutarch's, if
					indeed he ever wrote a book of this sort.
				</p>
            <p>S. Luria,in <hi rend="italics">Rheinisches Museum</hi>, lxxviii. (1929) p. 94,
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.254"/>
					
					has suggested that the <hi rend="italics">Parallela</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">De Fluviis</hi>
               <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Bernardakis's ed. vol. vii. pp. 282-328.</note>
					are parodies after the manner of Lucian's <hi rend="italics">True History</hi>;
					and both Hercher and Hartman have expressed the
					opinion that both works are by the same anonymous
					author, chiefly because it is difficult to imagine thato
					such fools as the author of each discloses himself to be
					could ever have lived ! The confusion that the author
					(ingeniously?) introduces, the forced simplicity of his
					glaring misnomers, his many references to authorities
					that Hercher<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Plutarchi libellus de fluviis</hi> (Leipzig, 1851). Schlereth, however, has severely criticized Hercher's conclusions. On the sources of <hi rend="italics">De Fluviis</hi> see Atenst&auml;dt, <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, lvii. pp. 219 ff.</note> has attempted to show never existed,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Yet M&uuml;ller receives them all as Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum. It has not been thought worth while to include in the notes the references to M&uuml;ller, since no additional information is to be found there. All the references, however, will be found in the recent Teubner edition.</note>
					all have been thought to suggest that the <hi rend="italics">Parallela</hi>
					is a parody of the comparisons in the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi> ; but
					J. Schlereth, in his excellent dissertation <hi rend="italics">De Plutarchi
					quae feruntur Parallela Minora</hi> (Freiburg, 1931), has
					with great learning and acumen attempted to disprove
					this thesis.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">It must be noted that many of the points which Plutarch has selected for comparison in the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi>, that is, in the so-called <foreign lang="greek">*sugkri/seis</foreign>, are very tenuous, not to say inept. They would lend themselves readily to parody. On the <foreign lang="greek">*su/gkrisis</foreign> see further F. Focke, <hi rend="italics">Hermes</hi>, lviii. pp. 327 ff.</note> His work may be consulted by anyone
					who may be curious about the sources, the language,
					or the purpose of the <hi rend="italics">Parallela Minora</hi>.
				</p>
            <p>Wilhelm Schmid (<hi rend="italics">Philologische Wochenschrift</hi> 1932,
					coll. 625-634) has reviewed Schlereth's work with
					great care. Both Schmid and Nachst&auml;dt hold that
					the citations from otherwise unknown authors are
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.255"/>
					
					genuine, not falsifications of the compiler. Nachst&auml;dt,
					accordingly in the Teubner edition of 1934, gives all
					the references, and also adds, for convenient comparison, the most important passages from Stobaeus,
					Lydus, and a <hi rend="italics">gnomologicum Parisinum</hi>, published by
					Sternbach in 1893, which seem to have the same
					original as the text of the present work.
