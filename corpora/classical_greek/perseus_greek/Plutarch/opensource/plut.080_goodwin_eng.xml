            <p>Our great ignorance of the Divine Beings most naturally runs in two streams; whereof the one in harsh and coarse
				tempers, as in dry and stubborn soils, produces atheism,
				and the other in the more tender and flexible, as in moist
				and yielding grounds, produces superstition. Indeed, every
				wrong judgment, in matters of this nature especially, is
				a great unhappiness to us; but it is here attended with a
				passion, or disorder of the mind, of a worse consequence
				than itself. For every such passion is, as it were, an error
				inflamed. And as a dislocation is the more painful when
				it is attended with a bruise, so are the perversions of our
				understandings, when attended with passion. Is a man of
				opinion that atoms and a void were the first origins of
				things? It is indeed a mistaken conceit, but makes no
				ulcer, no shooting, no searching pain. But is a man of
				opinion that wealth is his last good? This error contains
				in it a canker; it preys upon a man's spirits, it transports
				him, it suffers him not to sleep, it makes him horn-mad, it
				carries him over headlong precipices, strangles him, and
				makes him unable to speak his mind. Are there some
				again, that take virtue and vice for substantial bodies?
				This may be sottish conceit indeed, but yet it bespeaks
				neither lamentations nor groans. But such opinions and
				conceits as these,&mdash;

				and for thee have I quitted injustice, the way to wealth, and
				excess, the parent of all true pleasure,&mdash;these are the
				thoughts that call at once for our pity and indignation; for
				they will engender swarms of diseases, like fly-blows and
				vermin, in our minds.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>To return then to our subject, atheism, which is
				a false persuasion that there are no blessed and incorruptible beings, tends yet, by its disbelief of a Divinity, to bring
				men to a sort of unconcernedness and indifferency of temper;
				for the design of those that deny a God is to ease themselves
				of his fear. But superstition appears by its appellation
				to be a distempered opinion and conceit, productive of
				such mean and abject apprehensions as debase and break
				a man's spirit, while he thinks there are divine powers indeed, but withal sour and vindictive ones. So that the
				atheist is not at all, and the superstitious is perversely, affected
				with the thoughts of God; ignorance depriving the one of
				the sense of his goodness, and superadding to the other a
				persuasion of his cruelty. Atheism then is but false reasoning single, but superstition is a disorder of the mind produced by this false reasoning.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>Every distemper of our minds is truly base and ignoble; yet some passions are accompanied with a sort of levity,
				that makes men appear gay, prompt, and erect; but none,
				we may say, are wholly destitute of force for action. But
				the common charge upon all sorts of passions is, that they
				excite and urge the reason, forcing it by their violent stings.
				Fear alone, being equally destitute of reason and audacity,
				renders our whole irrational part stupid, distracted, and unserviceable. Therefore it is called <foreign lang="greek">dei=ma</foreign> because it <hi rend="italics">binds,</hi>
				and <foreign lang="greek">ta/rbos</foreign> because it <hi rend="italics">distracts</hi> the mind.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plutarch derives <foreign lang="greek">dei=ma</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">de/w,</foreign>

					<hi rend="italics">confuse.</hi> (G.)</note> But of all fears,
				none so dozes and confounds as that of superstition. He
				fears not the sea that never goes to sea; nor a battle, that
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.170"/>
				
				follows not the camp; nor robbers, that stirs not abroad;
				nor malicious informers, that is a poor man; nor emulation,
				that leads a private life; nor earthquakes, that dwells in
				Gaul; nor thunderbolts, that dwells in Ethiopia: but he
				that dreads divine powers dreads every thing, the land, the
				sea, the air, the sky, the dark, the light, a sound, a silence,
				a dream. Even slaves forget their masters in their sleep;
				sleep lightens the irons of the fettered; their angry sores,
				mortified gangrenes, and pinching pains allow them some
				intermission at night.

				Superstition will not permit a man to say this. That
				alone will give no truce at night, nor suffer the poor soul
				so much as to breathe or look up, or respite her sour and
				dismal thoughts of God a moment; but raises in the sleep
				of the superstitious, as in the place of the damned, certain
				prodigious forms and ghastly spectres, and perpetually
				tortures the unhappy soul, chasing her out of sleep into
				dreams, lashed and tormented by her own self, as by some
				other, and charged by herself with dire and portentous
				injunctions. Neither have they, when awake, enough sense
				to slight and smile at all this, or to be pleased with the
				thought that nothing of all that terrified them was real;
				but they still fear an empty shadow, that could never mean
				them any ill, and cheat themselves afresh at noonday, and
				keep a bustle, and are at expense upon the next fortuneteller or vagrant that shall but tell them:&mdash;

				as tumbling in mire, rolling themselves in dunghills, keeping of Sabbaths, monstrous prostrations, long and obstinate
				sittings in a place, and vile and abject adorations, and all
				for vain superstition! They that were careful to preserve
				good singing used to direct the practisers of that science to
				sing with their mouths in their true and proper postures.
				Should not we then admonish those that would address
				themselves to the heavenly powers to do that also with a
				true and natural mouth, lest, while we are so solicitous that
				the tongue of a sacrifice be pure and right, we distort and
				abuse our own with silly and canting language, and thereby expose the dignity of our divine and ancient piety to
				contempt and raillery? It was not unpleasantly said somewhere by the comedian to those that adorned their beds with
				the needless ornaments of silver and gold: Since the Gods
				have given us nothing gratis except sleep, why will you
				make that so costly? It might as well be said to the
				superstitious bigot: Since the Gods have bestowed sleep on
				us, to the intent we may take some rest and forget our
				sorrows, why will you needs make it a continual irksome
				tormentor, when you know your poor soul hath ne'er
				another sleep to betake herself to? Heraclitus saith: They
				who are awake have a world in common amongst them; but
				they that are asleep are retired each to his own private
				world. But the frightful visionary hath ne'er a world at
				all, either in common with others or in private to himself;
				for neither can he use his reason when awake, nor be free
				from his fears when asleep; but he hath his reason always
				asleep, and his fears always awake; nor hath he either an
				hiding-place or refuge.</p>

            <p>Polycrates was formidable at Samos, and so was
				Periander at Corinth; but no man ever feared either of
				them that had made his escape to an equal and free
				government. But he that dreads the divine government,
				as a sort of inexorable and implacable tyranny, whither
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.172"/>
				
				can he remove? Whither can he fly? What land, what
				sea can he find where God is not? Wretched and miserable man! in what corner of the world canst thou so hide
				thyself, as to think thou hast now escaped him? Slaves
				are allowed by the laws, when they despair of obtaining
				their freedom, to demand a second sale, in hopes of kinder
				masters. But superstition allows of no change of Gods;
				nor could he indeed find a God he would not fear, that
				dreads his own and his ancestors' guardians, that quivers at
				his preservers and benign patrons, and that trembles and
				shakes at those of whom we ask wealth, plenty, concord,
				peace, and direction to the best words and actions. Slaves
				again account it their misfortune to become such, and can
				say,&mdash;
				
				
				<quote rend="blockquote">

				But how much less tolerable, think you, is their condition,
				that can never possibly run away, escape, or desert? A
				slave may fly to an altar, and many temples afford sanctuary
				to thieves; and they that are pursued by an enemy think
				themselves safe if they can catch hold on a statue or a
				shrine. But the superstitious fears, quivers, and dreads
				most of all there, where others when fearfullest take
				greatest courage. Never hale a superstitious man from
				the altar. It is his place of torment; he is there chastised. In one word, death itself, the end of life, puts no
				period to this vain and foolish dread; but it transcends
				those limits, and extends its fears beyond the grave, adding
				to it the imagination of immortal ills; and after respite from
				past sorrows, it fancies it shall next enter upon never-ending ones. I know not what gates of hell open themselves
				from beneath, rivers of fire together with Stygian torrents
				present themselves to view; a gloomy darkness appears
				full of ghastly spectres and horrid shapes, with dreadful
				aspects and doleful groans, together with judges and tormentors,
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.173"/>
				
				 pits and caverns, full of millions of miseries and
				woes. Thus does wretched superstition bring inevitably
				upon itself by its fancies even those calamities which it has
				once escaped.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>Atheism is attended with none of this. True indeed,
				the ignorance is very lamentable and sad. For to be blind
				or to see amiss in matters of this consequence cannot but
				be a fatal unhappiness to the mind, it being then deprived
				of the fairest and brightest of its many eyes, the knowledge
				of God. Yet this opinion (as hath been said) is not necessarily accompanied with any disordering, ulcerous, frightful,
				or slavish passion. Plato thinks the Gods never gave men
				music, the science of melody and harmony, for mere
				delectation or to tickle the ear, but in order that the
				confusion and disorder in the periods and harmonies of
				the soul, which often for want of the Muses and of grace
				break forth into extravagance through intemperance and
				license, might be sweetly recalled, and artfully wound up
				to their former consent and agreement.

				rage immediately and run stark mad, and in fine tear
				themselves in pieces. They certainly suffer the less
				inconvenience of the two, who either through defect of
				hearing or utter deafness are wholly insensible of music,
				and therefore unmoved by it. It was a great misfortune
				indeed to Tiresias, that he wanted sight to see his friends
				and children; but a far greater to Athamas and Agave, to
				see them in the shape of lions and bucks. And it had
				been happier for Hercules, when he was distracted, if he

         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>Well then, is not this the very case of the atheist,
				compared with the superstitious? The former sees not
				the Gods at all, the latter believes that he really sees them;
				the former wholly overlooks them, but the latter mistakes
				their benignity for terror, their paternal affection for
				tyranny, their providence for cruelty, and their frank simplicity for savageness and brutality.</p>
            <p>Again, the workman in copper, stone, and wax can persuade such that the Gods are in human shape; for so they
					make them, so they draw them, and so they worship them.
					But they will not hear either philosophers or statesmen
					that describe the majesty of the Divinity as accompanied
					by goodness, magnanimity, benignity, and beneficence.
					The one therefore hath neither a sense nor belief of that
					divine good he might participate of; and the other dreads
					and fears it. In a word, atheism is an absolute insensibility to God (or <hi rend="italics">want of passion</hi>), which does not
					recognize goodness; while superstition is a blind heap
					of passions, which imagine the good to be evil. They are
					afraid of their Gods, and yet run to them; they fawn upon
					them, and reproach them; they invoke them, and accuse
					them. It is the common destiny of humanity not to enjoy
					uninterrupted felicity.

            <p>Consider well the atheist, and observe his behavior

				otherwise a man of good temper, he is silent under his

				remedies or palliatives for his misfortunes. But if he be a
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.175"/>
				
				fretful and impatient man, his whole complaint is against
				Fortune. He cries out, that nothing is managed here
				below either after the rules of a strict justice or the orderly
				course of a providence, and that all human affairs are hurried and driven without either premeditation or distinction.
				This is not the demeanor of the superstitious; if the least
				thing do but happen amiss to him, he sits him down
				plunged in sorrow, and raises himself a vast tempest of
				intolerable and incurable passions, and presents his fancy
				with nothing but terrors, fears, surmises, and distractions,
				until he hath overwhelmed himself with groans and fears.
				He blames neither man, nor Fortune, nor the times, nor
				himself; but charges all upon God, from whom he fancies
				a whole deluge of vengeance to be pouring down upon
				him; and, as if he were not only unfortunate but in open
				hostility with Heaven, he imagines that he is punished by
				God and is now making satisfaction for his past crimes,
				and saith that his sufferings are all just and owing to himself. Again, when the atheist falls sick, he reckons up
				and calls to his remembrance his several surfeits and
				debauches, his irregular course of living, excessive labors,
				or unaccustomed changes of air or climate. Likewise,
				when he miscarries in any public administration, and either
				falls into popular disgrace or comes to be ill presented to
				his prince, he searches for the causes in himself and those
				about him, and asks,

				But the fanciful superstitionist accounts every little distemper in his body or decay in his estate, the death of his
				children, and crosses and disappointments in matters relating to the public, as the immediate strokes of God and
				the incursions of some vindictive daemon. And therefore
				he dares not attempt to remove or relieve his disasters, or
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.176"/>
				
				to use the least remedy or to oppose himself to them, for fear
				he should seem to struggle with God and to make resistance under correction. If he be sick, he thrusts away the
				physician; if he be in any grief, he shuts out the philosopher that would comfort and advise him. Let me alone,
				saith he, to pay for my sins: I am a cursed and vile offender, and detestable both to God and angels. Now suppose
				a man unpersuaded of a Divinity in never so great sorrow
				and trouble, you may yet possibly wipe away his tears, cut
				his hair, and force away his mourning; but how will you
				come at this superstitious penitentiary, either to speak to
				him or to bring him any relief? He sits him down without doors in sackcloth, or wrapped up in foul and nasty
				rags; yea, many times rolls himself naked in mire, repeating over I know not what sins and transgressions of his
				own; as, how he did eat this thing and drink the other
				thing, or went some way prohibited by his Genius. But
				suppose he be now at his best, and laboring under only a
				mild attack of superstition; you shall even then find him
				sitting down in the midst of his house all becharmed and
				bespelled, with a parcel of old women about him, tugging
				all they can light on, and hanging it upon him as (to use
				an expression of Bion's) upon some nail or peg.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="8">
            <p>It is reported of Teribazus that, being seized by the
				Persians, he drew out his scimitar, and being a very stout
				person, defended himself bravely; but when they cried
				out and told him he was apprehended by the king's order, he
				immediately put up his sword, and presented his hands to
				be bound. Is not this the very case of the superstitious?
				Others can oppose their misfortunes, repel their troubles,
				and furnish themselves with retreats, or means of avoiding
				the stroke of things not under the disposal of their wills;
				but the superstitious person, without anybody's speaking
				to him,&mdash;but merely upon his own saying to himself, This
				thou undergoest, vile wretch, by the direction of Providence,
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.177"/>
				
				and by Heaven's just appointment,&mdash;immediately casts
				away all hope, surrenders himself up, and shuns and
				affronts his friends that would relieve him. Thus do these
				sottish fears oftentimes convert tolerable evils into fatal and
				insupportable ones. The ancient Midas (as the story goes
				of him), being much troubled and disquieted by certain
				dreams, grew so melancholy thereupon, that he made himself away by drinking bull's blood. Aristodemus, king of
				Messenia, when a war broke out betwixt the Lacedaemonians and the Messenians, upon some dogs howling like
				wolves, and grass coming up about his ancestors' domestic
				altar, and his divines presaging ill upon it, fell into such a
				fit of sullenness and despair that he slew himself. And
				perhaps it had been better if the Athenian general, Nicias,
				had been eased of his folly the same way that Midas and
				Aristodemus were, than for him to sit still for fear of a
				lunar eclipse, while he was invested by an enemy, and so
				be himself made a prisoner, together with an army of forty
				thousand men (that were all either slain or taken), and die
				ingloriously. There was nothing formidable in the interposition of the earth betwixt the sun and the moon, neither
				was there any thing dreadful in the shadow's meeting the
				moon at the proper time: no, the dreadfulness lay here,
				that the darkness of ignorance should blind and befool
				a man's reason at a time when he had most occasion to
				use it.
