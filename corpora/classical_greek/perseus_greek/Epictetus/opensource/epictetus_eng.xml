<head>Arrian's Discourses of Epictetus</head>
<div1 type="book" n="0">
<div2 type="chapter" n="0">
<head>Arrian to Lucius Gellius, with wishes for his happiness.</head>
<p>I NEITHER wrote these Discourses<note anchored="yes">A. Gellius (<bibl n="Gel. 1.2">i. 2</bibl> and <bibl n="Gel. 17.19">xvii. 19</bibl>)
speaks of the Discourses of Epictetus
being arranged by Arrian; and Gellius (<bibl n="Gel. 19.1">xix. 1</bibl>) speaks of a fifth book
of these Discourses, but only four are extant and some fragments. The
whole number of books was eight, as Photius (Cod. 58) says. There
is also extant an Encheiridion or Manual, consisting of short pieces
selected from the Discourses of Epictetus; and there is the valuable
commentary on the Encheiridion written by Simplicius in the sixth
century A. D. and in the reign of Justinian.
<p>Arrian explains in a manner what he means by saying that he did
not write these Discourses of Epictetus; but he does not explain his
meaning when he says that he did not make them public. He tells
us that he did attempt to write down in the words of Epictetus what
the philosopher said; but how it happened that they were first published, without his knowledge or consent, Arrian does not say. It
appears, however, that he did see the Discourses when they were
published; and as Schweighaeuser remarks, he would naturally correct
any errors that he detected, and so there would be an edition revised
by himself. Schweighaeuser has a note (i. ch. 26, 13) on the difficulties
which we now find in the Discourses.</p></note> of Epictetus in the way
in which a man might write such things; nor did I make
them public myself, inasmuch as I declare that I did not
even write them. But whatever I heard him say, the
same I attempted to write down in his own words as
nearly as possible, for the purpose of preserving them as
memorials to myself afterwards of the thoughts and the
freedom of speech of Epictetus. Accordingly, the Discourses are naturally such as a man would address without preparation to another, not such as a man would write
<pb n="2"/>
with the view of others reading them. Now, being such,
I do not know how they fell into the hands of the public,
without either my consent or my knowledge. But it
concerns me little if I shall be considered incompetent
to write; and it concerns Epictetus not at all if any man
shall despise his words; for at the time when he uttered
them, it was plain that he had no other purpose than to
move the minds of his hearers to the best things. If, indeed,
these Discourses should produce this effect, they will have,
I think, the result which the words of philosophers ought
to have. But if they shall not, let those who read them
know that, when Epictetus delivered them, the hearer
could not avoid being affected in the way that Epictetus
wished him to be. But if the Discourses themselves,
as they are written, do not effect this result, it may be
that the fault is mine, or, it may be, that the thing is
unavoidable.</p>

<div1 type="book" n="1">
<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>Of the things which are in our power, and not in our power.</head>
<p>OF all the faculties (except that which I shall soon mention), you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself, and, consequently, not capable either of
approving or disapproving.<note anchored="yes"><quote>This moral approving and disapproving faculty</quote> is Bp. Butler's
translation of the <foreign lang="greek">dokimastikh/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)podokimastikh/</foreign> of Epictetus (i. 1, 1)
in his dissertation, Of the Nature of Virtue. See his note.</note> How far does the grammatic
art possess the contemplating power? As far as forming
a judgment about what is written and spoken. And how
far music? As far as judging about melody. Does
either of them then contemplate itself? By no means.
But when you must write something to your friend,
grammar will tell you what words you should write; but
whether you should write or not, grammar will not tell
you. And so it is with music as to musical sounds; but
whether you should sing at the present time and play on
the lute, or do neither, music will not tell you. What
faculty then will tell you? That which contemplates
both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty?
The rational faculty;<note anchored="yes">The rational faculty is the <foreign lang="greek">logikh\ yuxh/</foreign> of Epictetus and Antoninus,
of which Antoninus says (xi. 1): <quote>These are the properties of
the rational soul: it sees itself, analyses itself, and makes itself such
as it chooses; the fruit which it bears, itself enjoys.</quote></note> for this is the only faculty that we
<pb n="4"/>
have received which examines itself, what it is, and what
power it has, and what is the value of this gift, and examines all other faculties: for what else is there which
tells us that golden things are beautiful, for they do not
say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is
capable of judging of appearances.<note anchored="yes">This is what he has just named the rational faculty. The Stoics
gave the name of appearances (<foreign lang="greek">fantasi/ai</foreign>) to all impressions received
by the senses, and to all emotions caused by external things. Chrysippus said:
<quote lang="greek">fantasi/a e)sti\ pa/qos e)n th=| yuxh=| gino/menon, e)ndeiknu/menon e(auto/ te
kai\ to\ pepoihko/s</quote> (Plutarch, iv. c. 12, De Placit. Philosoph.).</note> What else judges of
music, grammar, and the other faculties, proves their uses,
and points out the occasions for using them? Nothing
else.</p>
<p>As then it was fit to be so, that which is best of
all and supreme over all is the only thing which the
gods have placed in our power, the right use of appearances; but all other things they have not placed in our
power. Was it because they did not choose? I indeed
think that, if they had been able, they would have put
these other things also in our power, but they certainly
could not.<note anchored="yes">Compare Antoninus, ii. 3. Epictetus does not intend to limit the
power of the gods, but he means that the constitution of things being
what it is, they cannot do contradictories. They have so constituted
things that man is hindered by externals. How then could they
give to man a power of not being hindered by externals? <placeName key="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName>
    (<bibl n="Sen. Prov. 6">De Providentia, c. 6</bibl>) says: <quote>But it may be said, many things
happen which cause sadness, fear, and are hard to bear. Because
(God says) I could not save you from them, I have armed your minds
against all.</quote> This is the answer to those who imagine that they have
disproved the common assertion of the omnipotence of God, when
they ask whether He can combine inherent contradictions, whether He
can cause two and two to make five. This is indeed a very absurd
way of talking.</note> For as we exist on the earth, and are bound
to such a body and to such companions, how was it possible for us not to be hindered as to these things by
externals?</p>
<p>But what says Zeus? Epictetus, if it were possible,
I would have made both your little body and your little
property free and not exposed to hindrance. But now be
not ignorant of this: this body is not yours, but it is clay
finely tempered. And since I was not able to do for you
<pb n="5"/>
what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion
of us,<note anchored="yes">Schweighaeuser observes that these faculties of pursuit and avoidance, and of desire and aversion, and even the faculty of using
appearances, belong to animals as well as to man: but animals in
using appearances are moved by passion only, and do not understand
what they are doing, while in man these passions are under his
control. Salmasius proposed to change <foreign lang="greek">h(me/teron</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">u(me/teron</foreign>, to
remove the difficulty about these animal passions being called <quote>a
small portion of us (the gods).</quote> Schweighaeuser, however, though he
sees the difficulty, does not accept the emendation. Perhaps Arrian
has here imperfectly represented what his master said, and perhaps he
did not.</note> this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it,
and the faculty of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the
faculty of using the appearances of things; and if you will
take care of this faculty and consider it your only possession, you will never be hindered, never meet with impediments; you will not lament, you will not blame, you will
not flatter any person.</p>
<p>Well, do these seem to you small matters? I hope
not. Be content with them then and pray to the
gods. But now when it is in our power to look after
one thing, and to attach ourselves to it, we prefer to look
after many things, and to be bound to many things, to
the body and to property, and to brother and to friend,
and to child and to slave. Since then we are bound to
many things, we are depressed by them and dragged down.
For this reason, when the weather is not fit for sailing, we
sit down and torment ourselves, and continually look out
to see what wind is blowing. It is north. What is that
to us? When will the west wind blow? When it shall
choose, my good man, or when it shall please Aeolus; for
God has not made you the manager of the winds, but
Aeolus.<note anchored="yes">He alludes to the <cit><bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.21">Odyssey, X. 21:</bibl>
<quote lang="greek"><l>kei=non ga\r tami/hn a)ne/mwn poi/hse *kroni/wn.</l></quote></cit></note> What then? We must make the best use that
we can of the things which are in our power, and use the
rest according to their nature. What is their nature
then? As God may please.</p>
<p>Must I then alone have my head cut off? What, would
you have all men lose their heads that you may be consoled? 
<pb n="6"/>
Will you not stretch out your neck as Lateranus<note anchored="yes">Plautius Lateranus, consul-elect, was charged with being engaged
in <placeName key="tgn,2040810">Piso</placeName>'s conspiracy against <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>. He was hurried to execution
without being allowed to see his children; and though the tribune
who executed him was privy to the plot, Lateranus said nothing.

did at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> when <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> ordered him to be beheaded?
For when he had stretched out his neck, and received a
feeble blow, which made him draw it in for a moment, he
stretched it out again. And a little before, when he was
visited by Epaphroditus,<note anchored="yes">Epaphroditus was a freedman of <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>, and once the master of
Epictetus. He was Nero's secretary. One good act is recorded of
him: he helped Nero to kill himself, and for this act he was killed by
Domitian (<bibl n="Suet. Dom. 14">Suetonius, Domitian, c. 14</bibl>).</note> Nero's freedman, who asked him
about the cause of offence which he had given, he said, <quote>If
I choose to tell anything, I will tell your master.</quote></p>
<p>What then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? What else than this? What is mine, and
what is not mine; and what is permitted to me, and what
is not permitted to me. I must die. Must I then die
lamenting? I must be put in chains. Must I then also
lament? I must go into exile. Does any man then
hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and
contentment? Tell me the secret which you possess. I
will not, for this is in my power. But I will put you in
chains.<note anchored="yes">This is an imitation of a passage in the Bacchae of Euripides
(<bibl n="Eur. Ba. 492">v. 492, &amp;c.</bibl>), which is also imitated by Horace (<bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.16">Epp, i, 16</bibl>).</note> Man,
what are you talking about? Me in
chains? You may fetter my leg, but my will<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">h( proai/resi/s</foreign>. It is

Zeus himself can overpower. I will throw you into prison.
My poor body, you mean. I will cut your head off. When
then have I told you that my head alone cannot be cut
off? These are the things which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they
should exercise themselves.</p>
<p>Thrasea<note anchored="yes">Thrasea Paetus, a Stoic philosopher, who was ordered in Nero's
time to put himself to death (<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16.21">Tacit. Ann. xvi. 21&ndash;35</bibl>). He was
the husband of Arria, whose mother Arria, the wife of Caecina Paetus,
in the time of the Emperor Claudius, heroically showed her husband
the way to die (Plinius, <bibl n="Plin. Ep. 3.16">Letters, iii. 16</bibl>.) Martial has immortalised
the elder Arria in a famous epigram (<bibl n="Mart. 1.14">i. 14</bibl>):&mdash;
<quote lang="en"><lg type="ia5">
<l>When Arria to her Paetus gave the sword,</l>
<l>Which her own hand from her chaste bosom drew,</l>

<l>But that will pain me which thy hand will do.'</l></lg></quote></note> used to say, I would rather be killed to-day

than banished to-morrow. What then did <placeName key="tgn,2057400">Rufus</placeName><note anchored="yes">C. Musonius Rufus, a <placeName key="tgn,2734548">Tuscan</placeName> by birth, of equestrian rank, a
philosopher and Stoic (<bibl n="Tac. Hist. 3.81">Tacit. Hist. iii. 81</bibl>).</note> say to
him? If you choose death as the heavier misfortune,
how great is the folly of your choice? But if, as the
lighter, who has given you the choice? Will you not
study to be content with that which has been given to
you?</p>
<p>What then did Agrippinus<note anchored="yes">Paconius Agrippinus was condemned in <placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>'s time. The charge
against him was that he inherited his father's hatred of the head of
the Roman state (<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16.28">Tacit. Ann. xvi. 28</bibl>). The father of Agrippinus
had been put to death under <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> (Suetonius, <bibl n="Suet. Tib. 61">Tib. c. 61</bibl>).</note> say? He said, <quote>I am not
a hindrance to myself.</quote> When it was reported to him
that his trial was going on in the Senate, he said, <quote>I hope
it may turn out well; but it is the fifth hour of the day</quote>
&mdash;this was the time when he was used to exercise himself
and then take the cold bath&mdash;<quote>let us go and take our
exercise.</quote> After he had taken his exercise, one comes
and tells him, You have been condemned. To banishment, he replies, or to death? To banishment. What
about my property? It is not taken from you. Let us
go to Aricia then,<note anchored="yes">Aricia, about twenty Roman miles from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Via Appia</placeName>

<p>This it is to have studied what a man ought to study;
to have made desire, aversion, free from hindrance, and
free from all that a man would avoid. I must die. If
now, I am ready to die. If, after a short time, I now dine
because it is the dinner-hour; after this I will then die.
How? Like a man who gives up<note anchored="yes">Epictetus, Encheiridion, c. 11: <quote>Never say on the occasion of
anything, 'I have lost it' but say, 'I have returned it.'</quote></note> what belongs to
another.

<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<head>How a man on every occasion can maintain his proper character.</head>
<p>To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable;
but that which is rational is tolerable. Blows are not
naturally intolerable. How is that? See how the Lacedaemonians<note anchored="yes">The Spartan boys used to be whipped at the altar of Artemis
Orthia till blood flowed abundantly, and sometimes till death; but
they never uttered even a groan (Cicero, Tuscul. ii. 14; v. 27).</note> endure whipping when they have learned that
whipping is consistent with reason. To hang yourself is
not intolerable. When then you have the opinion that it
is rational, you go and hang yourself. In short, if we
observe, we shall find that the animal man is pained by
nothing so much as by that which is irrational; and, on
the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that
which is rational.</p>
<p>But the rational and the irrational appear such in a
different way to different persons, just as the good and the
bad, the profitable and the unprofitable. For this reason,
particularly, we need discipline, in order to learn how to
adapt the preconception<note anchored="yes">The preconception <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign> is thus defined by the Stoics: <foreign lang="greek">e)sti dh\ h( pro/lhyis e)/nnoia fusikh\ tw=n kaq' o(/lou</foreign> (Diogenes Laert. vii.). <quote><hi rend="ital">We</hi>
name Anticipation all knowledge, by which I can <hi rend="ital">&agrave; priori</hi> know and
determine that which belongs to empirical knowledge, and without
doubt this is the sense in which Epicurus used his expression <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign></quote>(Kant, Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p. 152, 7th ed.). He
adds: <quote>But since there is something in appearances which never
can be known <hi rend="ital">&agrave; priori,</hi> and which consequently constitutes the difference between empirical knowledge and knowledge <hi rend="ital">&agrave; priori,</hi> that is,
sensation (as the material of observation), it follows that this sensation is specially that which cannot be anticipated (it cannot be a <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign>). On the other hand, we could name the pure determinations in space and time, both in respect to form and magnitude, anticipations of the appearances, because these determinations represent
<hi rend="ital">&agrave; priori</hi> whatever may be presented to us <hi rend="ital"> &agrave; posteriori</hi> in experience.</quote>
see also p. 8, &amp;c.</note> of the rational and the irrational
to the several things conformably to nature. But in order
to determine the rational and the irrational, we use not
only the estimates of external things, but we consider also
<pb n="9"/>
what is appropriate to each person. For to one man it is
consistent with reason to hold a chamber pot for another,
and to look to this only, that if he does not hold it, he will
receive stripes, and he will not receive his food: but if he
shall hold the pot, he will not suffer anything hard or disagreeable. But to another man not only does the holding
of a chamber pot appear intolerable for himself, but intolerable also for him to allow another to do this office for
him. If then you ask me whether you should hold the
chamber pot or not, I shall say to you that the receiving
of food is worth more than the not receiving of it, and the
being scourged is a greater indignity than not being
scourged; so that if you measure your interests by these
things, go and hold the chamber pot. <quote>But this,</quote> you
say, <quote>would not be worthy of me.</quote> Well then, it is you
who must introduce this consideration into the inquiry,
not I; for it is you who know yourself, how much you are
worth to yourself, and at what price you sell yourself; for
men sell themselves at various prices.</p>
<p>For this reason, when Florus was deliberating whether
he should go down to <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>'s<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> was passionately fond of scenic representations, and used to
induce the descendants of noble families, whose poverty made them
consent, to appear on the stage (<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14.14">Tacitus, Annals, xiv. 14</bibl>; Suetonius,
<bibl n="Suet. Nero 21">Nero, c. 21</bibl>).</note> spectacles, and also perform
in them himself, Agrippinus said to him, Go down:
and when Florus asked Agrippinus, Why do not you go
down? Agrippinus replied, Because I do not even deliberate about the matter. For he who has once brought
himself to deliberate about such matters, and to calculate
the value of external things, comes very near to those
who have forgotten their own character. For why do you
ask me the question, whether death is preferable or life?
I say life. Pain or pleasure? I say pleasure. But if I
do not take a part in the tragic acting, I shall have my
head struck off. Go then and take a part, but I will not.
Why? Because you consider yourself to be only one
thread of those which are in the tunic. Well then it was
fitting for you to take care how you should be like the rest
of men, just as the thread has no design to be anything
<pb n="10"/>
superior to the other threads. But I wish to be purple,<note anchored="yes">The <quote>purple</quote> is the broad purple border on the toga named the
<hi rend="ital">toga praetexta,</hi> worn by certain Roman magistrates and some others,
and by senators, it is said, on certain days (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.43">Cic. Phil. ii. 43</bibl>).</note>
that small part which is bright, and makes all the rest
appear graceful and beautiful. Why then do you tell me
to make myself like the many? and if I do, how shall I
still be purple?</p>
<p>Priscus Helvidius<note anchored="yes">Helvidius Priscus, a Roman senator and a philosopher, is commended
by Tacitus (<bibl n="Tac. Hist. 4.4.5">Hist. iv. 4, 5</bibl>) as an honest man: <quote>He followed
the philosophers who considered those things only to be good which
are virtuous, those only to be bad which are foul; and he reckoned
power, rank, and all other things which are external to the mind as
neither good nor bad.</quote> Vespasian, probably in a fit of passion, being
provoked by Helvidius, ordered him to be put to death, and then
revoked the order when it was too late (Suetonius <bibl n="Suet. Ves. 15">Vespasianus,
c. 15</bibl>).</note> also saw this, and acted conformably.
For when Vespasian sent and commanded him not to go
into the senate, he replied, <quote>It is in your power not to
allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long as I
am, I must go in.</quote> Well, go in then, says the emperor, but say nothing. Do not ask my opinion, and
I will be silent. But I must ask your opinion. And
I must say what I think right. But if you do, I
shall put you to death. When then did I tell you
that I am immortal? You will do your part, and I
will do mine: it is your part to kill; it is mine to die,
but not in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart
without sorrow.</p>
<p>What good then did Priscus do, who was only a single
person? And what good does the purple do for the toga?
Why, what else than this, that it is conspicuous in the
toga as purple, and is displayed also as a fine example to
all other things? But in such circumstances another
would have replied to Caesar who forbade him to enter the
senate, I thank you for sparing me. But such a man
Vespasian would not even have forbidden to enter the
senate, for he knew that he would either sit there like an
earthen vessel, or, if he spoke, he would say what Caesar
wished, and add even more.
<pb n="11"/></p>
<p>In this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of
dying unless his private parts were amputated. His
brother came to the athlete, who was a philosopher, and
said, Come, brother, what are you going to do? Shall we
amputate this member and return to the gymnasium?
But the athlete persisted in his resolution and died.
When some one asked Epictetus, How he did this, as an
athlete or a philosopher? As a man, Epictetus replied,
and a man who had been proclaimed among the athletes at
the Olympic games and had contended in them, a man who
had been familiar with such a place, and not merely
anointed in Baton's school.<note anchored="yes">Baton was elected for two years gymnasiarch or superintendent of
a gymnasium in or about the time of M. Aurelius Antoninus. See
Schweighaeuser's note.</note> Another would have allowed
even his head to be cut off, if he could have lived without
it. Such is that regard to character which is so strong in
those who have been accustomed to introduce it of themselves and conjoined with other things into their deliberations.</p>
<p>Come then, Epictetus, shave<note anchored="yes">This is supposed, as Casaubon says, to refer to Domitian's order
to the philosophers to go into exile; and some of them, in order to
conceal their profession of philosophy, shaved their beards. Epictetus
would not take off his beard.</note> yourself. If I am a philosopher, I answer, I will not shave myself. But I will take
off your head? If that will do you any good, take it off.</p>
<p>Some person asked, how then shall every man among
us perceive what is suitable to his character? How, he
replied, does the bull alone, when the lion has attacked,
discover his own powers and put himself forward in
defence of the whole herd? It is plain that with the
powers the perception of having them is immediately conjoined: and, therefore, whoever of us has such powers
will not be ignorant of them. Now a bull is not made suddenly, nor a brave man; but we must discipline ourselves
in the winter for the summer campaign, and not rashly
run upon that which does not concern us.</p>
<p>Only consider at what price you sell your own will: if
for no other reason, at least for this, that you sell it not for
a small sum. But that which is great and superior perhaps
<pb n="12"/>

but he employs his aversion only on things which are dependent on his will. For if he attempts to avoid anything
independent of his will, he knows that sometimes he will
fall in with something which he wishes to avoid, and he
will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises good fortune
and tranquillity and happiness, certainly also the progress
towards virtue is progress towards each of these things.
For it is always true that to whatever point the perfecting
of anything leads us, progress is an approach towards this
point.</p>
<p>How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have
said, and yet seek progress in other things and make a display of it? What is the product of virtue? Tranquillity.
Who then makes improvement? Is it he who has read
many books of Chrysippus?<note anchored="yes">Diogenes Laertius (Chrysippus, lib. vii.) states that Chrysippus
wrote seven hundred and five books, or treatises, or whatever the
word <foreign lang="greek">suggra/mmata</foreign> means. He was born at <placeName key="perseus,Soli">Soli</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, or at

having understood Chrysippus? If this is so, progress is
clearly nothing else than knowing a great deal of Chrysippus. But now we admit that virtue produces one
thing, and we declare that approaching near to it is
another thing, namely, progress or improvement. Such a
person, says one, is already able to read Chrysippus by
himself. Indeed, sir, you are making great progress.
What kind of progress? But why do you mock the man?
Why do you draw him away from the perception of his
own misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of
virtue that he may learn where to look for improvement?
<pb n="15"/>
Seek it there, wretch, where your work lies. And where
is your work? In desire and in aversion, that you may
not be disappointed in your desire, and that you may not
fall into that which you would avoid; in your pursuit and
avoiding, that you commit no error; in assent and suspension of assent, that you be not deceived. The first
things, and the most necessary, are those which I have
named.<note anchored="yes">Compare iii. c. 2. The word is <foreign lang="greek">to/poi</foreign>.</note> But if with trembling and lamentation you

Halteres. So, when you say: Take the treatise on the
active powers (<foreign lang="greek">o(rmh/</foreign>), and see how I have studied it. I
reply, Slave, I am not inquiring about this, but how you
exercise pursuit and avoidance, desire and aversion, how
you design and purpose and prepare yourself, whether
conformably to nature or not. If conformably, give me
evidence of it, and I will say that you are making progress: but if not conformably, be gone, and not only
expound your books, but write such books yourself; and

what will you gain by it? Do you not know that the
whole book costs only five denarii? Does then the expounder seem to be worth more than five denarii? Never
then look for the matter itself in one place, and progress
towards it in another.</p>
<p>Where then is progress? If any of you, withdrawing
himself from externals, turns to his own will (<foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>)
to exercise it and to improve it by labour, so as to make it
conformable to nature, elevated, free, unrestrained, unimpeded, faithful, modest; and if he has learned that he
who desires or avoids the things which are not in his
power can neither be faithful nor free, but of necessity he
must change with them and be tossed abort with them as

others who have the power to procure or prevent what
he desires or would avoid; finally, when he rises in the
morning, if he observes and keeps these rules, bathes as a
man of fidelity, eats as a modest man; in like manner, if
in every matter that occurs he works out his chief principles <foreign lang="greek">ta\ prohgou/mena</foreign>) as the runner does with reference to
running, and the trainer of the voice with reference to the
voice&mdash;this is the man who truly makes progress, and this
is the man who has not travelled in vain. But if he has
strained his efforts to the practice of reading books, and
labours only at this, and has travelled for this, I tell him
to return home immediately, and not to neglect his affairs
there; for this for which he has travelled is nothing. But
the other thing is something, to study how a man can
rid his life of lamentation and groaning, and saying, Woe
to me, and wretched that I am, and to rid it also of misfortune and disappointment, and to learn what death is,
and exile, and prison, and poison, that he may be able to
say when he is in fetters, Dear Crito,<note anchored="yes">This is said in the Criton of Plato, 1; but not in exactly the
same way.</note> if it is the will of the
gods that it be so, let it be so; and not to say, Wretched
am I, an old man; have I kept my grey hairs for this?

not Priam say this? Does not Oedipus say this? Nay,
all kings say it!<note anchored="yes">So kings and such personages speak in the Greek tragedies.
Compare what M. Antoninus (xi. 6) says of Tragedy.</note> For what else is tragedy than the perturbations (<foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>) of men who value externals exhibited in

that no external things which are independent of the will

aid of which I should live happily and undisturbed. But
you must consider for yourselves what you wish.</p>
<p>What then does Chrysippus teach us? The reply is,
to know that these things are not false, from which happiness comes and tranquillity arises. Take my books, and
you will learn how true and conformable to nature are the
things which make me free from perturbations. O great

<p>IF a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident truths, it is
not easy to find arguments by which we shall make him

stone, how shall we then be able to deal with him by
argument?</p>
<p>Now there are two kinds of hardening, one of the understanding, the other of the sense of shame, when a man
is resolved not to assent to what is manifest nor to desist
from contradictions. Most of us are afraid of mortification
of the body, and would contrive all means to avoid such a
thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification. And
indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state
as not to apprehend anything, or understand at all, we
think that he is in a bad condition: but if the sense of
shame and modesty are deadened, this we call even power
(or strength).</p>
<p>Do you comprehend that you are awake? I do not, the
man replies, for I do not even comprehend when in my
sleep I imagine that I am awake. Does this appearance
then not differ from the other? Not at all, he replies.
Shall I still argue with this man?<note anchored="yes">Compare Cicero, Academ. Prior. ii. 6.</note> And what fire or
what iron shall I apply to him to make him feel that he is
deadened? He does perceive, but he pretends that he
does not. He is even worse than a dead man. He does
not see the contradiction: he is in a bad condition.
Another does see it, but he is not moved, and makes no
improvement: he is even in a worse condition. His
modesty is extirpated, and his sense of shame; and the
rational faculty has not been cut off from him, but it is
brutalised. Shall I name this strength of mind? Cer-
tainly not, unless we also name it such in catamites,
through which they do and say in public whatever comes
into their head.

<head>Of Providence.</head>
<p>FROM everything which is or happens in the world, it
is easy to praise Providence, if a man possesses these two
qualities, the faculty of seeing what belongs and happens
to all persons and things, and a grateful disposition. If he
does not possess these two qualities, one man will not see
the use of things which are and which happen; another
will not be thankful for them, even if he does know them.
If God had made colours, but had not made the faculty of
seeing them, what would have been their use? None at
all. On the other hand, if He had made the faculty of
vision, but had not made objects such as to fall under the
faculty, what in that case also would have been the use
of it? None at all. Well, suppose that He had made
both, but had not made light? In that case, also, they
would have been of no use. Who is it then who has
fitted this to that and that to this? And who is it that
has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the knife?
Is it no one?<note anchored="yes">Goethe has a short poem, entitled Gleich und Gleich (Like and

things which have attained their completion, we are accustomed to show that the work is certainly the act of some
artificer, and that it has not been constructed without a
purpose. Does then each of these things demonstrate the
workman, and do not visible things and the faculty of
seeing and light demonstrate Him? And the existence of
male and female, and the desire of each for conjunction,
and the power of using the parts which are constructed,
do not even these declare the workman? If they do not,
let us consider<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note. I have given the sense of the passage, I
think.</note> the constitution of our understanding
<pb n="20"/>
according to which, when we meet with sensible objects,
we do not simply receive impressions from them, but we
also select<note anchored="yes">Cicero, De Off. i. c. 4, on the difference between man and beast.</note> something from them, and subtract something,
and add, and compound by means of them these things or
those, and, in fact, pass from some to other things which,
in a manner, resemble them: is not even this sufficient
to move some men, and to induce them not to forget the
workman? If not so, let them explain to us what it is
that makes each several thing, or how it is possible that
things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art
should exist by chance and from their own proper motion?</p>
<p>What, then, are these things done in us only? Many,
indeed, in us only, of which the rational animal had
peculiarly need; but you will find many common to us
with irrational animals. Do they then understand what
is done? By no means. For use is one thing, and understanding is another: God had need of irrational animals
to make use of appearances, but of us to understand the
use of appearances.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig,'s note, tom. ii. p. 84.</note> It is therefore enough for them to
eat and to drink, and to sleep and to copulate, and to do all
the other things which they severally do. But for us, to
whom He has given also the intellectual faculty, these
things are not sufficient; for unless we act in a proper
and orderly manner, and conformably to the nature and
constitution of each thing, we shall never attain our true
end. For where the constitutions of living beings are
different, there also the acts and the ends are different.
In those animals then whose constitution is adapted only
to use, use alone is enough: but in an animal (man), which
has also the power of understanding the use, unless there
be the due exercise of the understanding, he will never
attain his proper end. Well then God constitutes every
animal, one to be eaten, another to serve for agriculture,
another to supply cheese, and another for some like use;
for which purposes what need is there to understand
appearances and to be able to distinguish them? But God
has introduced man to be a spectator of God<note anchored="yes">The original is <foreign lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign>, which I refer to God; but it may be am-
biguous. Schweighaeuser refers it to man, and explains it to mean that man should be a spectator of himself, according to the maxim,
<foreign lang="greek">*gnw=qi seauto/n</foreign>. It is true that man can in a manner contemplate
himself and his faculties as well as external objects; and as every
man can be an object to every other man, so a man may be an object
to himself when he examines his faculties and reflects on his own
acts. Schweighaeuser asks how can a man be a spectator of God,
except so far as he is a spectator of God's works? It is not enough;
he says, to reply that God and the universe, whom and which man
contemplates, are the same thing to the Stoics; for Epictetus always
distinguishes God the maker and governor of the universe from the
universe itself. But here lies the difficulty. The universe is an
all-comprehensive term: it is all that we can in any way perceive and
conceive as existing; and it may therefore comprehend God, not as
something distinct from the universe, but as being the universe himself. This form of expression is an acknowledgment of the weakness of
the human faculties, and contains the implicit assertion of Locke that
the notion of God is beyond man's understanding (Essay, etc. ii. c. 17).</note> and of His
<pb n="21"/>
works; and not only a spectator of them, but an interpreter.
For this reason it is shameful for man to begin and to end
where irrational animals do; but rather he ought to begin
where they begin, and to end where nature ends in us;
and nature ends in contemplation and understanding, and
in a way of life conformable to nature. Take care then
not to die without having been spectators of these things.</p>

Is it then consistent with reason that there should be running of noses in the world?&mdash;Nay, how much better it is
to wipe your nose than to find fault. What do you think
that Hercules would have been if there had not been such
a lion, and hydra, and stag, and boar, and certain unjust
and bestial men, whom Hercules used to drive away and
clear out? And what would he have been doing if there
had been nothing of the kind? Is it not plain that he
would have wrapped himself up and have slept? In the
first place then he would not have been a Hercules, when
he was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and ease;
and even if he had been one, what would have been the
use of him? and what the use of his arms, and of the
strength of the other parts of his body, and his endurance
and noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions had
not roused and exercised him? Well then must a man
provide for himself such means of exercise, and seek to introduce a lion from some place into his country, and a boar,
and a hydra? This would be folly and madness: but as
they did exist, and were found, they were useful for showing what Hercules was and for exercising him. Come

power, without even having reserved to Himself any power
of hindering or impeding. You, who have received these
powers free and as your own, use them not: you do not
even see what you have received, and from whom; some of
you being blinded to the giver, and not even acknowledging your benefactor, and others, through meanness of

ought to be made into those topics (<foreign lang="greek">to/pwn</foreign>) on which particularly questioning and answering are employed. For
what is the end proposed in reasoning? To establish true
propositions, to remove the false, to withhold assent from
those which are not plain. Is it enough then to have
learned only this? It is enough, a man may reply. Is
it then also enough for a man, who would not make a
mistake in the use of coined money, to have heard this
precept, that he should receive the genuine drachmae and
reject the spurious? It is not enough. What then ought
to be added to this precept? What else than the faculty
which proves and distinguishes the genuine and the spurious
drachmae? Consequently also in reasoning what has been
said is not enough; but it is necessary that a man should
acquire the faculty of examining and distinguishing the
true and the false, and that which is not plain? It is
necessary. Besides this, what is proposed in reasoning?
That you should accept what follows from that which you
have properly granted. Well, is it then enough in this
case also to know this? It is not enough; but a man
must learn how one thing is a consequence of other things,
and when one thing follows from one thing, and when it
follows from several collectively. Consider then if it be
not necessary that this power should also be acquired by
him, who purposes to conduct himself skilfully in reasoning, the power of demonstrating himself the several
things which he has proposed,<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note on <foreign lang="greek">a)podei/cein e(/kasta a)podo/nta</foreign>.</note> and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others, and of not being
deceived by sophists, as if they were demonstrating.
Therefore there has arisen among us the practice and
<pb n="25"/>
exercise of conclusive arguments<note anchored="yes">These are syllogisms and figures, modes (<foreign lang="greek">tro/poi</foreign>) by which the
syllogism has its proper conclusion.</note> and figures, and it has
been shown to be necessary.</p>
<p>But in fact in some cases we have properly granted the
premises<note anchored="yes">Compare Aristotle, Topic. viii. 1, 22 (ed. J. Pac. 758). Afterwards Epictetus uses <foreign lang="greek">ta\ w(mologhme/na</foreign> as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">lh/mmata</foreign>
(premises or assumptions).</note> or assumptions, and there results from them
something; and though it is not true, yet none the less it
does result. What then ought I to do? Ought I to admit
the falsehood? And how is that possible? Well, should I
say that I did not properly grant that which we agreed
upon? But you are not allowed to do even this. Shall I
then say that the consequence does not arise through what
has been conceded? But neither is this allowed. What then
must be done in this case? Consider if it is not this: as
to have borrowed is not enough to make a man still a
debtor, but to this must be added the fact that he continues
to owe the money and that the debt is not paid, so it is not
enough to compel you to admit the inference<note anchored="yes"><quote>The inference,</quote> <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)pifero/menon.</foreign> <quote><foreign lang="greek">*)epifora/</foreign> est 'illatio' quae
assumptionem sequitur</quote> (Upton).</note>that you have
granted the premises (<foreign lang="greek">ta\ lh/mmata</foreign>), but you must abide
by what you have granted. Indeed, if the premises continue to the end such as they were when they were granted,
it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have
granted, and we must accept their consequences: but if
the premises do not remain<note anchored="yes">This, then, is a case of <foreign lang="greek">metapi/ptontes lo/goi</foreign> (chap. vii. 1), where
there has been a sophistical or dishonest change in the premises or in
some term, by virtue of which change there appears to be a just conclusion, which, however, is false; and it is not a conclusion derived
from the premises to which we assented. A ridiculous example is
given by <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName>, Ep. 48: <quote>Mus syllaba est: mus autem caseum
rodit: syllaba ergo caseum rodit.</quote> <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> laughs at this absurdity,
and says perhaps the following syllogism (<hi rend="ital">collectio</hi>) may be a better
example of acuteness: <quote>Mus syllaba est: syllaba autem caseum non
rodit: mus ergo caseum non rodit.</quote> One is as good as the other. We
know that neither conclusion is true, and we see where the error is.
M&eacute;nage says that though the Stoics particularly cultivated logic,
some of them despised it, and he mentions <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName>, Epictetus, and
Marcus Antoninus. Upton, however, observes that Epictetus and
Marcus Antoninus did not despise logic (he says nothing about
<placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName>), but employed it for their own purposes.
<p>It has been observed that if a man is asked whether, if every A is
B, every B is also A, he might answer that it is. But if you put the
conversion in this material form: <quote>Every goose is an animal,</quote> he
immediately perceives that he cannot say, <quote>Every animal is a goose.</quote>
What does this show? It shows that the man's comprehension of the
proposition, every A is B, was not true, and that he took it to mean
Something different from what the person intended who put the
question. He understood that A and B were coextensive. Whether
we call this reasoning or something else, makes no matter. A man
whose understanding is sound cannot in the nature of things reason
wrong; but his understanding of the matter on which he reasons may
be wrong somewhere, and he may not be able to discover where. A
man who has been trained in the logical art may show him that his
conclusion is just according to his understanding of the terms and the
propositions employed, but yet it is not true.</p></note> such as they were when they
<pb n="26"/>
were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us also to with-
draw from what we granted, and from accepting what does
not follow from the words in which our concessions were
made. For the inference is now not our inference, nor does
it result with our assent, since we have withdrawn from the
premises which we granted. We ought then both to examine such kinds of premises, and such change and variation of them (from one meaning to another), by which in
the course of questioning or answering, or in making the
syllogistic conclusion, or in any other such way, the premises undergo variations, and give occasion to the foolish
to be confounded, if they do not see what conclusions
(consequences) are. For what reason ought we to examine? In order that we may not in this matter be
employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way.</p>
<p>And the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments;
for it is necessary sometimes to demand the granting of
some hypothesis as a kind of passage to the argument
which follows. Must we then allow every hypothesis that
is proposed, or not allow every one? And if not every
one, which should we allow? And if a man has allowed
an hypothesis, must he in every case abide by allowing
it? or must he sometimes withdraw from it, but admit the
consequences and not admit contradictions? Yes; but
suppose that a man says, If you admit the hypothesis of
a possibility, I will draw you to an impossibility. With
such a person shall a man of sense refuse to enter into a
contest, and avoid discussion and conversation with him?
But what other man than the man of sense can use argumentation and is skilful in questioning and answering, and
<pb n="27"/>
incapable of being cheated and deceived by false reasoning?
And shall he enter into the contest, and yet not take care
whether he shall engage in argument not rashly and not
carelessly? And if he does not take care, how can he be
such a man as we conceive him to be? But without some
such exercise and preparation, can he maintain a continuous and consistent argument? Let them show this;
and all these speculations (<foreign lang="greek">qewrh/mata</foreign>) become superfluous,
and are absurd and inconsistent with our notion of a good
and serious man.</p>
<p>Why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish,
and why do we seek pretences for not labouring and not
being watchful in cultivating our reason? If then I shall
make a mistake in these matters may I not have killed my
father? Slave, where was there a father in this matter
that you could kill him? What then have you done?
The only fault that was possible here is the fault which
you have committed. This is the very remark which I
made to Rufus<note anchored="yes">Rufus is Musonius Rufus (i. 1). To kill a father and to burn
the Roman Capitol are mentioned as instances of the greatest crimes.
Comp. <bibl n="Hor. Epod. 3">Horace, Epode, iii.</bibl>; Cicero, De Amicit. c. 11; Plutarch, Tib.
Gracchus, c. 20.</note> when he blamed me for not having discovered the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism: I
suppose, I said, that I have burnt the Capitol. Slave, he
replied, was the thing omitted here the Capitol? Or are
these the only crimes, to burn the Capitol and to kill your
father? But for a man to use the appearances presented
to him rashly and foolishly and carelessly, and not to
understand argument, nor demonstration, nor sophism,
nor, in a word, to see in questioning and answering what
is consistent with that which we have granted or is not
consistent; is there no error in this?

instance: if you have borrowed and not repaid, you owe

skilfully is suitable to no man more than to the philosopher; for if the enthymeme is an imperfect syllogism,
it is plain that he who has been exercised in the perfect
syllogism must be equally expert in the imperfect also.</p>
<p>Why then do we not exercise ourselves and one another
in this manner? Because, I reply, at present, though we are
not exercised in these things and not distracted from the
study of morality, by me at least, still we make no progress
in virtue. What then must we expect if we should add
this occupation? and particularly as this would not only
be an occupation which would withdraw us from more
necessary things, but would also be a cause of self-conceit
and arrogance, and no small cause. For great is the
power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion, and particularly if it should be much exercised, and also receive
additional ornament from language: and so universally,
every faculty acquired by the uninstructed and weak
brings with it the danger of these persons being elated
<pb n="29"/>
and inflated by it. For by what means could one persuade
a young man who excels in these matters, that he ought
not to become an appendage<note anchored="yes">A man, as Wolf explains it, should not make oratory, or the art

an appendage to himself? Does he not trample on all such

him of what he has neglected and to what he has turned
aside?</p>

and was not Hippocrates a physician? but you see how
Hippocrates speaks. Does Hippocrates then speak thus in
respect of being a physician? Why do you mingle things
which have been accidentally united in the same men?
And if Plato was handsome and strong, ought I also to set
to work and endeavour to become handsome or strong, as if
this was necessary for philosophy, because a certain philosopher was at the same time handsome and a philosopher?

<p>I indeed think that the old man<note anchored="yes">The old man is Epictetus.</note> ought to be sitting
here, not to contrive how you may have no mean thoughts
nor mean and ignoble talk about yourselves, but to take
care that there be not among us any young men of such a
mind, that when they have recognised their kinship to
God, and that we are fettered by these bonds, the body,
I mean, and its possessions, and whatever else on account
of them is necessary to us for the economy and commerce
of life, they should intend to throw off these things as if
they were burdens painful and intolerable, and to depart
to their kinsmen. But this is the labour that your
teacher and instructor ought to be employed upon, if he
really were what he should be. You should come to him
and say, <quote>Epictetus, we can no longer endure being
bound to this poor body, and feeding it and giving it
drink, and rest, and cleaning it, and for the sake of the
body complying with the wishes of these and of those.<note anchored="yes">He means, as Wolf says, <quote>on account of the necessities of the
body seeking the favour of the more powerful by disagreeable compliances.</quote></note>
Are not these things indifferent and nothing to us; and
is not death no evil? And are we not in a manner
kinsmen of God, and did we not come from him? Allow
us to depart to the place from which we came; allow us
to be released at last from these bonds by which we are
bound and weighed down. Here there are robbers and
thieves and courts of justice, and those who are named
tyrants, and think that they have some power over us by
means of the body and its possessions. Permit us to show
them that they have no power over any man.</quote> And I on
my part would say, <quote>Friends, wait for God: when He
shall give the signal<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,1030954">Upton</placeName> refers to Cicero, Tuscul. i. 30, Cato Major, c. 20; Somnium
Scipionis, c. 3 (De Republica, iv. 15); the purport of which passage
is that we must not depart from life without the command of God.
See Marcus Antoninus, ii. 17; iii. 5; v. 33. But how shall a man know
the signal for departure, of which Epictetus speaks?</note> and release you from this service,
then go to Him; but for the present endure to dwell in
this place where He has put you: short indeed is this

<head>Of natural affection.</head>
<p>WHEN he was visited by one of the magistrates, Epictetus
inquired of him about several particulars, and asked if he
had children and a wife. The man replied that he had;
and Epictetus inquired further, how he felt under the
circumstances. Miserable, the man said. Then Epictetus
asked, In what respect, for men do not marry and beget
children in order to be wretched, but rather to be happy.
But I, the man replied, am so wretched about my children
that lately, when my little daughter was sick and was supposed to be in danger, I could not endure to stay with
her, but I left home till a person sent me news that she
had recovered. Well then, said Epictetus, do you think that
you acted right? I acted naturally, the man replied. But
convince me of this that you acted naturally, and I will
convince you that everything which takes place according
to nature takes place rightly. This is the case, said the
man, with all or at least most fathers. I do not deny that:
but the matter about which we are inquiring is whether
such behaviour is right; for in respect to this matter we
must say that tumours also come for the good of the body,
because they do come; and generally we must say that to
do wrong is natural, because nearly all or at least most of
us do wrong. Do you show me then how your behaviour
is natural. I cannot, he said; but do you rather show me
how it is not according to nature, and is not rightly
done.</p>
<p>Well, said Epictetus, if we were inquiring about white and
black, what criterion should we employ for distinguishing
between them? The sight, he said. And if about hot and
cold, and hard and soft, what criterion? The touch. Well
then, since we are inquiring about things which are according to nature, and those which are done rightly or not
rightly, what kind of criterion do you think that we should
employ? I do not know, he said. And yet not to know
the criterion of colours and smells, and also of tastes, is
<pb n="38"/>
perhaps no great harm; but if a man do not know the
criterion of good and bad, and of things according to nature
and contrary to nature, does this seem to you a small harm?
The greatest harm (I think). Come tell me, do all things
which seem to some persons to be good and becoming,
rightly appear such; and at present as to Jews and Syrians
and Egyptians and Romans, is it possible that the opinions
of all of them in respect to food are right? How is it
possible? he said. Well, I suppose, it is absolutely necessary that, if the opinions of the Egyptians are right, the
opinions of the rest must be wrong: if the opinions of the
Jews are right, those of the rest cannot be right. Certainly. But where there is ignorance, there also there is
want of learning and training in things which are necessary. He assented to this. You then, said Epictetus,
since you know this, for the future will employ yourself
seriously about nothing else, and will apply your mind to
nothing else than to learn the criterion of things which are
according to nature, and by using it also to determine each
several thing. But in the present matter I have so muck
as this to aid you towards what you wish. Does affection
to those of your family appear to you to be according to
nature and to be good? Certainly. Well, is such affection
natural and good, and is a thing consistent with reason not
good? By no means. Is then that which is consistent with
reason in contradiction with affection? I think not. You
are right, for if it is otherwise, it is necessary that one of
the contradictions being according to nature, the other must
be contrary to nature. Is it not so? It is, he said. Whatever
then we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate
and also consistent with reason, this we confidently declare
to be right and good. Agreed. Well then to leave your
sick child and to go away is not reasonable, and I suppose
that you will not say that it is; but it remains for us to
inquire if it is consistent with affection. Yes, let us consider. Did you then, since you had an affectionate disposition to your child, do right when you ran off and left her;
and has the mother no affection for the child? Certainly,
she has. Ought then the mother also to have left her, or
ought she not? She ought not. And the nurse, does she
<pb n="39"/>
love her? She does. Ought then she also to have left her?
By no means. And the paedagogue,<note anchored="yes"><quote>When we are children our parents put us in the hands of a
paedagogue to see on all occasions that we take no harm.</quote>&mdash;Epictetus,
Frag. 97.</note> does he not love her?
He does love her. Ought then he also to have deserted
her? and so should the child have been left alone and
without help on account of the great affection of you the
parents and of those about her, or should she have died in
the hands of those who neither loved her nor cared for her?
Certainly not. Now this is unfair and unreasonable, not
to allow those who have equal affection with yourself to do
what you think to be proper for yourself to do because you
have affection. It is absurd. Come then, if you were
sick, would you wish your relations to be so affectionate,
and all the rest, children and wife, as to leave you alone
and deserted? By no means. And would you wish to be
so loved by your own that through their excessive affection
you would always be left alone in sickness? or for this
reason would you rather pray, if it were possible, to be
loved by your enemies and deserted by them? But if this
is so, it results that your behaviour was not at all an affec-
tionate act.</p>
<p>Well then, was it nothing which moved you and induced
you to desert your child? and how is that possible? But
it might be something of the kind which moved a man at
<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to wrap up his head while a horse was running
which he favoured; and when contrary to expectation the
horse won, he required sponges to recover from his fainting fit. What then is the thing which moved? The
exact discussion of this does not belong to the present
occasion perhaps; but it is enough to be convinced of
this, if what the philosophers say is true, that we must
not look for it anywhere without, but in all cases it is one
and the same thing which is the cause of our doing or not
doing something, of saying or not saying something, of
being elated or depressed, of avoiding any thing or pur-
suing: the very thing which is now the cause to me and
to you, to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing,
and to me of saying what I do say. And what is this?
Is it any other than our will to do sc? No other. But
<pb n="40"/>
if we had willed otherwise, what else should we have
been doing than that which we willed to do? This then
was the cause of Achilles' lamentation, not the death of
Patroclus; for another man does not behave thus on the
death of his companion; but it was because he chose to
do so. And to you this was the very cause of your then
running away, that you chose to do so; and on the other
side, if you should (hereafter) stay with her, the reason
will be the same. And now you are going to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>
because you choose; and if you should change your mind,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ka)\n metado/ch|</foreign>, <quote>if you should change your mind,</quote> as we say. So
we may translate, in the previous part of this chapter, <foreign lang="greek">e)/docen h(mi=n</foreign>, and the like, <quote>we had a mind to such and such a thing.</quote> Below
it is said that the causes of our actions are <quote>our opinions and our

in which it is often used, that is, a man's resolve to do so and so. See
Schweig.'s note on <foreign lang="greek">u(po/lhyis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">do/gma</foreign>. As Antoninus says (viii. 1):
<quote>How then shall a man do this (what his nature requires)? If he
has principles (<foreign lang="greek">do/gmata</foreign>) from which come his affects (<foreign lang="greek">o(/rmai</foreign>) and his
acts (<foreign lang="greek">pra/ceis</foreign>)?</quote></note>
you will not go thither. And in a word, neither death
nor exile nor pain nor anything of the kind is the cause
of our doing anything or not doing; but our own opinions
and our wills (<foreign lang="greek">do/gmata</foreign>).</p>
<p>Do I convince you of this or not? You do convince
me. Such then as the causes are in each case, such also
are the effects. When then we are doing anything not
rightly, from this day we shall impute it to nothing else
than to the will (<foreign lang="greek">do/gma</foreign> or opinion) from which we have
done it: and it is that which we shall endeavour to take
away and to extirpate more than the tumours and abscesses
out of the body. And in like manner we shall give the
same account of the cause of the things which we do right;
and we shall no longer allege as causes of any evil to us,
either slave or neighbour, or wife or children, being persuaded, that if we do not think things to be what we do
think them to be, we do not the acts which follow from
such opinions; and as to thinking or not thinking, that is
in our power and not in externals. It is so, he said.

<head>Of contentment.</head>
<p>WITH respect to gods, there are some who say that a
divine being does not exist: others say that it exists, but
is inactive and careless, and takes no forethought about
any thing; a third class say that such a being exists and
exercises forethought, but only about great things and
heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth
class say that a divine being exercises forethought both
about things on the earth and heavenly things, but in a
general way only, and not about things severally. There
is a fifth class to whom <placeName key="tgn,2093866">Ulysses</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> belong, who
say: <quote>I move not without thy knowledge</quote><note anchored="yes">The line is from the prayer of <placeName key="tgn,2041721">Ulysses</placeName> to Athena: <quote>Hear me
child of Zeus, thou who standest by me always in all dangers, nor do
I even move without thy knowledge.</quote> <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> said that the gods
know everything, what is said and done and thought (Xenophon,
<bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.1.19">Mem. i. 1, 19</bibl>). Compare <placeName key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>, De Nat. Deorum, i. 1, 2; and Dr.
Price's Dissertation on Providence, sect. i. Epictetus enumerates the
various opinions about the gods in antient times. The reader may
consult the notes in Schweighaeuser's edition. The opinions about
God among modern nations, who are called civilized, and are so more
or less, do not seem to be so varied as in antient times: but the con-
trasts in modern opinions are striking. These modern opinions vary
between denial of a God, though the number of those who deny is
perhaps not large, and the superstitious notions about God and his
administration of the world, which are taught by teachers, learned
and ignorant, and exercise a great power over the minds of those who
are unable or do not dare to exercise the faculty of reason.</note>(<placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName>, x.
278).
<pb n="42"/>
Before all other things then it is necessary to inquire
about each of these opinions, whether it is affirmed truly
or not truly. For if there are no gods, how is it our
proper end to follow them?<note anchored="yes"><quote>To follow God,</quote> is a Stoical expression. Antoninus, x. 11.</note> And if they exist, but take
no care of anything, in this case also how will it be right
to follow them? But if indeed they do exist and look
after things, still if there is nothing communicated from
them to men, nor in fact to myself, how even so is it right
(to follow them)? The wise and good man then after considering all these things, submits his own mind to him
who administers the whole, as good citizens do to the law
of the state. He who is receiving instruction ought to
come to be instructed with this intention, How shall I
follow the gods in all things, how shall I be contented
with the divine administration, and how can I become
free? For he is free to whom every thing happens
according to his will, and whom no man can hinder.
What then is freedom madness? Certainly not: for madness; in freedom do not consist. But, you say, I would
have every thing result just as I like, and in whatever
way I like. You are mad, you are beside yourself. Do
you not know that freedom is a noble and valuable thing?
But for me inconsiderately to wish for things to happen
as I inconsiderately like, this appears to be not only not
noble, but even most base. For how do we proceed in
the matter of writing? Do I wish to write the name of
Dion as I choose? No, but I am taught to choose to write
it as it ought to be written. And how with respect to
music? In the same manner. And what universally in
every art or science? Just the same. If it were not so,
it would be of no value to know anything, if knowledge
were adapted to every man's whim. Is it then in this
alone, in this which is the greatest and the chief thing,
I mean freedom, that I am permitted to will inconside-
rately? By no means; but to be instructed is this, to
learn to wish that every thing may happen as it does.<note anchored="yes">This means that we ought to learn to be satisfied with everything
that happens, in fact with the will of God. This is a part of education, according to Epictetus. But it does not appear in our systems of
education so plainly as it does here. Antoninus (iv. 23): <quote>Everything
harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, 0 universe. Nothing
for me is too early nor too late. which is in due time for thee?</quote></note>
<pb n="43"/>
And how do things happen? As the disposer has disposed them? And he has appointed summer and winter,
and abundance and scarcity, and virtue and vice, and all
such opposites for the harmony of the whole;<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2002086">Upton</placeName> has collected the passages in which this doctrine was mentioned.
One passage is in Gellius (<bibl n="Gel. 6.1">vi. 1</bibl>), from the fourth book of
Chrysippus on Providence, who says: <quote>nothing is more foolish than
the opinions of those who think that good could have existed without
evil.</quote> Schweighaeuser wishes that Epictetus had discussed more fully
the question on the nature and origin of Evil. He refers to the commentary of Simplicius on the Encheiridion of Epictetus, c. 13 (8), and
34 (27), for his treatment of this subject. Epictetus (Encheiridion,
c. 27) says that <quote>as a mark is not set up for the purpose of missing it,
so neither does the nature of evil exist in the universe.</quote> Simplicius
observes (p. 278, ed. Schweig.): <quote>The Good is that which is according to each thing's nature, wherein each thing has its perfection: but
the Bad is the disposition contrary to its nature of the thing which
contains the bad, by which disposition it is deprived of that which is
according to nature, namely, the good. For if the Bad as well as the
Good were a disposition and perfection of the form (<foreign lang="greek">ei)/dous</foreign>) in which it
is, the bad itself would also be good and would not then be called
Bad.</quote></note> and to
each of us he has given a body, and parts of the body,
and possessions, and companions.</p>
<p>Remembering then this disposition of things, we ought
to go to be instructed, not that we may change the constitution<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign>. It is explained by what follows.</note> of things,&mdash;for we have not the power to do it,
nor is it better that we should have the power,&mdash;but in
order that, as the things around us are what they are and
by nature exist, we may maintain our minds in harmony
with the things which happen. For can we escape from
men? and how is it possible? And if we associate with
them, can we change them? Who gives us the power?
What then remains, or what method is discovered of holding commerce with them? Is there such a method by
which they shall do what seems fit to them, and we not
the less shall be in a mood which is conformable to nature?
But you are unwilling to endure and are discontented:
and if you are alone, you call it solitude; and if you are
with men, you call them knaves and robbers; and you
find fault with your own parents and children, and brothers
and neighbours. But you ought when you are alone to
call this condition by the name of tranquillity and freedom,
<pb n="44"/>
and to think yourself like to the gods; and when you are
with many, you ought not to call it crowd, nor trouble,
nor uneasiness, but festival and assembly, and so accept
all contentedly.</p>
<p>What then is the punishment of those who do not
accept? It is to be what they are. Is any person dissatisfied with being alone? let him be alone. Is a man
dissatisfied with his parents? let him be a bad son, and
lament. Is he dissatisfied with his children? let him
be a bad father. Cast him into prison. What prison?
Where he is already, for he is there against his will; and
where a man is against his will, there he is in prison. So
<placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> was not in prison, for he was there willingly-
Must my leg then be lamed? Wretch, do you then on
account of one poor leg find fault with the world? Will
you not willingly surrender it for the whole? Will you
not withdraw from it? Will you not gladly part with it
to him who gave it? And will you be vexed and discontented with the things established by Zeus, which he with
the Moirae (fates) who were present and spinning the
thread of your generation, defined and put in order?
Know you not how small apart you are compared with the
whole.<note anchored="yes"><quote>Et quota pars homo sit terrai totius unus.</quote> Lucret. vi. 652, and

to be begotten. Of what kind of parents? Of such as
they were. Well then, since they are such as they are, is
there no remedy given to you? Now if you did not know
for what purpose you possess the faculty of vision, you
would be unfortunate and wretched if you closed your
eyes when colours were brought before them; but in that
you possess greatness of soul and nobility of spirit for
every event that may happen, and you know not that you
possess them, are you not more unfortunate and wretched?
Things are brought close to you which are proportionate
to the power which you possess, but you turn away this
power most particularly at the very time when you ought
to maintain it open and discerning. Do you not rather
thank the gods that they have allowed you to be above
these things which they have not placed in your power,
and have made you accountable only for those which are
in your power? As to your parents, the gods have left
you free from responsibility; and so with respect to your
brothers, and your body, and possessions, and death and
life. For what then have they made you responsible?
For that which alone is in your power, the proper use of
appearances. Why then do you draw on yourself the
things for which you are not responsible? It is, indeed,
a giving of trouble to yourself.</p></div2>

the soldiers do to Caesar. But they who are hired for pay
swear to regard the safety of Caesar before all things; and
you who have received so many and such great favors,
will you not swear, or when you have sworn, will you not
abide by your oath? And what shall you swear? Never
to be disobedient, never to make any charges, never to
find fault with any thing that he has given, and never
unwillingly to do or to suffer any thing that is necessary.

<head>What philosophy promises.</head>
<p>WHEN a man was consulting him how he should persuade
his brother to cease being angry with him, Epictetus
replied, Philosophy does not propose to secure for a man
any external thing. If it did (or, if it were not, as I say),
philosophy would be allowing something which is not
within its province. For as the carpenter's material is
wood, and that of the statuary is copper, so the matter of
the art of living is each man's life.&mdash;What then is my
brother's?&mdash;That again belongs to his own art; but with
respect to yours, it is one of the external things, like a
piece of land, like health, like reputation. But Philosophy
promises none of these. In every circumstance I will maintain, she says, the governing part<note anchored="yes">This is <foreign lang="greek">to\ h(gemoniko/n</foreign>, a word often used by Antoninus, ii. 2; vi. S.</note> conformable to nature.
Whose governing part? His in whom I am, she says.</p>
<p>How then shall my brother cease to be angry with
me? Bring him to me and I will tell him. But I have
nothing to say to you about his anger.</p>
<p>When the man, who was consulting him, said, I seek
to know this, How, even if my brother is not reconciled
to me, shall I maintain myself in a state conformable to
nature? Nothing great, said Epictetus, is produced suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If you say
to me now that you want a fig, I will answer to you that
it requires time: let it flower<note anchored="yes"><quote>The philosopher had forgot that fig-trees do not blossom</quote> (Mrs.

becomes the fruit.

<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Of Providence.</head>
<p>Do not wonder if for other animals than man all things
are provided for the body, not only food and drink, but beds
also, and they have no need of shoes nor bed materials,
nor clothing; but we require all these additional things.
For animals not being made for themselves, but for service,
it was not fit for them to be made so as to need other
things. For consider what it would be for us to take care
not only of ourselves, but also about cattle and asses, how
they should be clothed, and how shod, and how they
should eat and drink. Now as soldiers are ready for their
commander, shod, clothed, and armed: but it would be
a hard thing for the chiliarch (tribune) to go round and
shoe or clothe his thousand men: so also nature has formed
the animals which are made for service, all ready, prepared, and requiring no further care. So one little boy
with only a stick drives the cattle.</p>
<p>But now we, instead of being thankful that we need
not take the same care of animals as of ourselves, complain
of God on our own account; and yet, in the name of Zeus
and the gods, any one thing of those which exist would
be enough to make a man perceive the providence of God,
at least a man who is modest and grateful. And speak
not to me now of the great things, but only of this, that
milk is produced from grass, and cheese from milk, and
wool form skins. Who made these things or devised
them? No one, you say. O amazing shamelessness and
stupidity!</p>
<p>Well, let us omit the works of nature, and contemplate
her smaller (subordinate, <foreign lang="greek">pa/rerga</foreign>) acts. Is there anything
less useful than the hair on the chin? What then, has
not nature used this hair also in the most suitable manner
possible? Has she not by it distinguished the male and
the female? does not the nature of every man forthwith
proclaim from a distance, I am a man: as such approach
me, as such speak to me; look for nothing else; see the
signs? Again, in the case of women, as she has mingled
<pb n="51"/>
something softer in the voice, so she has also deprived them
of hair (on the chin). You say, not so: the human animal
ought to have been left without marks of distinction, and
each of us should have been obliged to proclaim, I am a
man. But how is not the sign beautiful and becoming
and venerable? how much more beautiful than the cock's
comb, how much more becoming than the lion's mane?
For this reason we ought to preserve the signs which God
has given, we ought not to throw them away, nor to confound, as much as we can, the distinctions of the sexes.</p>
<p>Are these the only works of providence in us? And
what words are sufficient to praise them and set them forth
according to their worth? For if we had understanding,
ought we to do any thing else both jointly and severally
than to sing hymns and bless the deity, and to tell of
his benefits?<note anchored="yes">Antoninus, v. 33.</note> Ought we not when we are digging and
ploughing and eating to sing this hymn to God? <quote>Great
is God, who has given us such implements with which we
shall cultivate the earth: great is God who has given us
hands, the power of swallowing, a stomach, imperceptible
growth, and the power of breathing while we sleep.</quote> This
is what we ought to sing on every occasion, and to sing the
greatest and most divine hymn for giving us the faculty
of comprehending these things and using a proper way.<note anchored="yes">See <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>'s note on <foreign lang="greek">o(dw=|</foreign>.</note>
Well then, since most of you have become blind, ought there
not to be some man to fill this office, and on behalf of all to
sing<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)/|donta</foreign> is Schweighaeuser's probable emendation.</note> the hymn to God? For what else can I do, a lame
old man, than sing hymns to God? If then I was a nightingale, I would do the part of a nightingale. if I were
a swan, I would do like a swan. But now I am a rational
creature, and I ought to praise God: this is my work; I
do it, nor will I desert this post, so long as I am allowed
to keep it; and I exhort you to join in this same song.

<p>SINCE reason is the faculty which analyses<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">*lo/gos e)sti\n o( diarqrw=n</foreign>. <foreign lang="greek">*diarqrou=n</foreign> means <quote>to divide a thing

the rest, and it ought itself not to be unanalysed, by what
should it be analysed? for it is plain that this should be
done either by itself or by another thing. Either then
this other thing also is reason, or something else superior
to reason; which is impossible. But if it is reason, again
who shall analyse that reason? For if that reason does
this for itself, our reason also can do it. But if we shall
require something else, the thing will go on to infinity and
have no end.<note anchored="yes">This is obscure. The conclusion, <quote>Reason therefore is analysed
by itself</quote> is not in Epictetus; but it is implied, as Schweighaeuser
says (p. 197, notes). So Antoninus, xi. 1, writes: <quote>These are the
properties of the rational soul; it sees itself, analyses itself.</quote> If
reason, our reason, requires another reason to analyse it, that other
reason will require another reason to analyse that other reason; and
so on to infinity. If reason then, our reason, can be analysed, it must
be analysed by itself. The notes on the first part of this chapter in
the edition of Schweighaeuser may be read by those who are inclined.</note> Reason therefore is analysed by itself.

if you should say, <quote>I know not whether you are arguing
truly or falsely,</quote> and if I should express myself in any way
ambiguously, and you should say to me, <quote>Distinguish,</quote>
I will bear with you no longer, and I shall say to you, <quote>It

that his adversary's difficulty shows the necessity of Dialectic.</note> This is the reason, I suppose, why they
(the Stoic teachers) place the logical art first, as in the
measuring of corn we place first the examination of the
measure. But if we do not determine first what is a
<pb n="53"/>
modius, and what is a balance, how shall we be able to
measure or weigh anything?</p>
<p>In this case then if we have not fully learned and
accurately examined the criterion of all other things, by
which the other things are learned, shall we be able to
examine accurately and to learn fully any thing else? How
is this possible? Yes; but the modius is only wood, and
a thing which produces no fruit.&mdash;But it is a thing which
can measure corn.&mdash;Logic also produces no fruit.&mdash;As to
this indeed we shall see: but then even if a man should
grant this, it is enough that logic has the power of distinguishing and examining other things, and, as we may
say, of measuring and weighing them. Who says this?
Is it only Chrysippus, and <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>, and Cleanthes? And
does not Antisthenes say so?<note anchored="yes">Antisthenes who professed the Cynic philosophy, rejected Logic
and Physic (Schweig. note p. 201).</note> And who is it that has
written that the examination of names is the beginning of
education? And does not <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> say so? And of whom

education ought to be. We learn language, and we ought to learn
what it means. When children learn words, they should learn what
the thing is which is signified by the word. In the case of children
this can only be done imperfectly as to some words, but it may be
done even then in some degree; and it must be done, or the word
signifies nothing, or, what is equally bad, the word is misunderstood.
All of us pass our lives in ignorance of many words which we use;
some of us in greater ignorance than others, but all of us in ignorance
to some degree.</note> Is this then the
great and wondrous thing to understand or interpret Chrysippus? Who says this?&mdash;What then is the wondrous
thing?&mdash;To understand the will of nature. Well then do
you apprehend it yourself by your own power? and what
more have you need of? For if it is true that all men
err involuntarily, and you have learned the truth, of necessity you must act right.&mdash;But in truth I do not apprehend
the will of nature. Who then tells us what it is?&mdash;They
say that it is Chrysippus.&mdash;I proceed, and I inquire what
this interpreter of nature says. I begin not to understand
what he says: I seek an interpreter of Chrysippus.&mdash;Well,
consider how this is said, just as if it were said in the
<pb n="54"/>
Roman tongue.<note anchored="yes">The supposed interpreter says this. When Epictetus says <quote>the
Roman tongue,</quote> perhaps he means that the supposed opponent is a
Roman and does not know Greek well.</note>&mdash;What then is this superciliousness of
the interpreter?<note anchored="yes">Encheiridion, c. 49. <quote>When a man gives himself great airs
because he can understand and expound Chrysippus, say to yourself,
If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this man would have had
nothing to be proud of.</quote> See the rest.</note> There is no superciliousness which can
justly be charged even to Chrysippus, if he only interprets
the will of nature, but does not follow it himself; and
much more is this so with his interpreter. For we have
no need of Chrysippus for his own sake, but in order that
we may understand nature. Nor do we need a diviner
(sacrificer) on his own account, but because we think that
through him we shall know the future and understand the
signs given by the gods; nor do we need the viscera of
animals for their own sake, but because through them
signs are given; nor do we look with wonder on the crow
or raven, but on God, who through them gives signs?<note anchored="yes">Compare Xenophon, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.1.3">Mem. i. 1, 3</bibl>.</note></p>
<p>I go then to the interpreter of these things and the
sacrificer, and I say, Inspect the viscera for me, and tell me
what signs they give. The man takes the viscera, opens
them, and interprets: Man, he says, you have a will free
by nature from hindrance and compulsion; this is written
here in the viscera. I will show you this first in the matter
of assent. Can any man hinder you from assenting to the
truth? No man can. Can any man compel you to receive
what is false? No man can. You see that in this matter
you have the faculty of the will free from hindrance, free
from compulsion, unimpeded. Well then, in the matter of
desire and pursuit of an object, is it otherwise? And what
can overcome pursuit except another pursuit? And what
can overcome desire and aversion (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisin</foreign>) except another
desire and aversion? But, you object: <quote>If you place before
me the fear of death, you do compel me.</quote> No, it is not what
is placed before you that compels, but your opinion that it
is better to do so and so than to die. In this matter then
it is your opinion that compelled you: that is, will compelled will<note anchored="yes">This is true. If you place before a man the fear of death, you
threaten him with the fear of death. The man may yield to the threat and do what it is the object of the threat to make him do; or
he may make resistance to him who attempts to enforce the threat;
or he may refuse to yield, and so take the consequence of his refusal.
If a man yields to the threat, he does so for the reason which Epictetus gives, and freedom of choice, and consequently freedom of will
really exists in this case. The Roman law did not allow contracts or
agreements made under the influence of threats to be valid; and the
reason for declaring them invalid was not the want of free will in him
who yielded to the threat, but the fact that threats are directly contrary to the purpose of all law, which purpose is to secure the independent action of every person in all things allowed by law. This
matter is discussed by Savigny, Das heut. R&ouml;mische Recht, iii. &sect; 114.
See the title 'Quod metus causa,' in the Digest, 4, 2. Compare also
Epictetus, iv. 1, 68, etc.</note>. For if God had made that part of himself,
<pb n="55"/>
which he took from himself and gave to us, of such a
nature as to be hindered or compelled either by himself or
by another, he would not then be God nor would he be
taking care of us as he ought. This, says the diviner, I
find in the victims: these are the things which are signified to you. If you choose, you are free; if you choose,
you will blame no one: you will charge no one. All will
be at the same time according to your mind and the mind
of God. For the sake of this divination I go to this
diviner and to the philosopher, not admiring him for this
interpretation, but admiring the things which he interprets.</p></div2>

is so, and in the case of dissent the persuasion that a
thing is not so, and in the case of a suspense of judgment
the persuasion that a thing is uncertain, so also in the
<pb n="56"/>
case of a movement towards any thing the persuasion that
a thing is for a man's advantage, and it is impossible to
think that one thing is advantageous and to desire another,
and to judge one thing to be proper and to move towards
another, why then are we angry with the many?<note anchored="yes">Mrs. Carter says: <quote>The most ignorant persons often practise
what they know to be evil: and they, who voluntarily suffer, as many
do, their inclinations to blind their judgment, are not justified by following it. (Perhaps she means <quote>them,</quote> <quote>their inclinations.</quote>) The
doctrine of Epictetus therefore, here and elsewhere, on this head, contradicts the voice of reason and conscience: nor is it less pernicious
than ill-grounded. It destroys all guilt and merit, all punishment
and reward, all blame of ourselves or others, all sense of misbehaviour
towards our fellow-creatures, or our Creator. No wonder that such
philosophers did not teach repentance towards God.</quote>
<p>Mrs. Carter has not understood Epictetus; and her censure is misplaced. It is true that <quote>the most ignorant persons often practise what
they know to be evil,</quote> as she truly says. But she might have said
more. It is also true that persons, who are not ignorant, often do what
they know to be evil, and even what they would condemn in another,
at least before they had fallen into the same evil themselves; for
when they have done what they know to be wrong, they have a fellow-
feeling with others who are as bad as themselves. Nor does he say,
as Mrs. Carter seems to imply that he does, for her words are ambiguous, that they who voluntarily suffer their inclinations to blind
their judgment are justified by following them. He says that men
will do as they do, so long as they think as they think. He only
traces to their origin the bad acts which bad men do; and he says
that we should pity them and try to mend them. Now the best man
in the world, if he sees the origin and direct cause of bad acts in men,
may pity them for their wickedness, and he will do right. He will
pity, and still he will punish severely, if the interests of society
require the guilty to be punished: but he will not punish in anger.
Epictetus says nothing about legal penalties; and I assume that he
would not say that the penalties are always unjust, if I understand his
principles. His discourse is to this effect, as the title tells us, that we
ought not to be angry with the errors of others: the matter of the
discourse is the feeling and disposition which we ought to have towards
those who do wrong, <quote>because they are mistaken about good and
evil.</quote></p>
<p>He does not discuss the question of the origin of these men's mistake
further than this: men think that a thing or act is advantageous; and
it is impossible for them to think that one thing is advantageous and
to desire another thing. Their error is in their opinion. Then he
tells us to show them their error, and they will desist from their
errors. He is not here examining the way of showing them their
error; by which I suppose that he means convincing them of their
error. He seems to admit that it may not be possible to convince them of their errors; for he says, <quote>if they do not see their errors, they
have nothing superior to their present opinion.</quote></p>
<p>This is the plain and certain meaning of Epictetus which Mrs. Carter
in her zeal has not seen.</p></note>
<pb n="57"/>
They are thieves and robbers, you may say. What do
you mean by thieves and robbers? They are mistaken
about good and evil. Ought we then to be angry with
them, or to pity them? But show them their error, and
you will see how they desist from their errors. If they
do not see their errors, they have nothing superior to
their present opinion.</p>
<p>Ought not then this robber and this adulterer to be
destroyed? By no means say so, but speak rather in this
way: This man who has been mistaken and deceived about
the most important things, and blinded, not in the faculty
of vision which distinguishes white and black, but in the
faculty which distinguishes good and bad, should we not
destroy him? If you speak thus, you will see how inhuman this is which you say, and that it is just as if you
would say, Ought we not to destroy this blind and deaf
man? But if the greatest harm is the privation of the
greatest things, and the greatest thing in every man is the
will or choice such as it ought to be, and a man is deprived of this will, why are you also angry with him?
Man, you ought not to be affected contrary to nature by
the bad things of another.<note anchored="yes">Here the text, 9, 10, 11 is defective. See Schweighaeuser's note.</note> Pity him rather: drop this
readiness to be offended and to hate, and these words which
the many utter: <quote>these accursed and odious fellows.</quote>
How have you been made so wise at once? and how are
you so peevish? Why then are we angry? Is it because
we value so much the things of which these men rob us?
Do not admire your clothes, and then you will not be
angry with the thief. Do not admire the beauty of your
wife, and you will not be angry with the adulterer. Learn
that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things
which are yours, but in those which belong to others and
which are not in your power. If you dismiss these things
and consider them as nothing, with whom are you still
angry? But so long as you value these things, be angry
with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer.
<pb n="58"/>
Consider the matter thus: you have fine clothes; your
neighbour has not: you have a window; you wish to
air the clothes. The thief does not know wherein man's
good consists, but he thinks that it consists in having
fine clothes, the very thing which you also think. Must
he not then come and take them away? When you show
a cake to greedy persons, and swallow it all yourself, do
you expect them not to snatch it from you? Do not provoke them: do not have a window: do not air your
clothes. I also lately had an iron lamp placed by the
side of my household gods: hearing a noise at the door, I
ran down, and found that the lamp had been carried off.
I reflected that he who had taken the lamp had done
nothing strange. What then? To-morrow, I said, you
will find an earthen lamp: for a man only loses that which
he has. I have lost my garment. The reason is that you
had a garment. I have pain in my head. Have you any
pain in your horns? Why then are you troubled? for we
only lose those things, we have only pains about those
things which we possess.<note anchored="yes">The conclusion explains what precedes. A man can have no
pain in his horns, because he has none. A man cannot be vexed
about the loss of a thing if he does not possess it. <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName> says that

beginning with them to proceed to the greater. I have

<head>How we should behave to tyrants.</head>
<p>IF a man possesses any superiority, or thinks that he does,
when he does not, such a man, if he is uninstructed, will
of necessity be puffed up through it. For instance, the
tyrant says, <quote>I am master of all?</quote> And what can you
do for me? Can you give me desire which shall have no
hindrance? How can you? Have you the infallible
power of avoiding what you would avoid? Have you the
power of moving towards an object without error? And
how do you possess this power? Come, when you are in
a ship, do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman? And
when you are in a chariot, to whom do you trust but to
the driver? And how is it in all other arts? Just the
same. In what then lies your power? All men pay
respect<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">qerapeu/ousi</foreign>. Epictetus continues to use the same word.</note> to me. Well, I also pay respect to my platter,
and I wash it and wipe it; and for the sake of my oil
flask, I drive a peg into the wall. Well then, are these
things superior to me? No, but they supply some of my
wants, and for this reason I take care of them. Well, do
I not attend to my ass? Do I not wash his feet? Do I
not clean him? Do you not know that every man has
regard to himself, and to you just the same as he has
regard to his ass? For who has regard to you as a man?
Show me. Who wishes to become like you? Who
imitates you, as he imitates <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>?&mdash;But I can cut off
your head.&mdash;You say right. I had forgotten that I must
have regard to you, as I would to a fever<note anchored="yes">Febris, fever, was a goddess at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName> refers to an inscrip-
tion in Gruter 97, which begins <quote>Febri Divae.</quote> Compare Lactantius,
De falsa religione, c. 20.</note> and the bile,
and raise an altar to you, as there is at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> an altar
to fever.</p>
<p>What is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multitude? is it the tyrant and his guards? [By no means.]
I hope that it is not so. It is not possible that what
is by nature free can be disturbed by anything else, or
<pb n="61"/>
hindered by any other thing than by itself. But it is a
man's own opinions which disturb him: for when the
tyrant says to a man, <quote>I will chain your leg,</quote> he who
values his leg says, <quote>Do not; have pity:</quote> but he who
values his own will says, <quote>If it appears more advantageous
to you, chain it.</quote> Do you not care? I do not care. I
will show you that I am master. You cannot do that.
Zeus has set me free: do you think that he intended to
allow his own son<note anchored="yes">Comp. i. c. 3.</note> to be enslaved? But you are master
of my carcase: take it.&mdash;So when you approach me, you
have no regard to me? No, but I have regard to myself;
and if you wish me to say that I have regard to you also,
I tell you that I have the same regard to you that I have
to my pipkin.</p>
<p>This is not a perverse self-regard,<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">fi/lauton</foreign>, self-love, but here it means self-regard, which
implies no censure. See Aristotle, Ethic. Nicom. ix. c. 8: <foreign lang="greek">w(s e)n ai)sxrw=| filau/tous a)pokalou=si</foreign>. His conclusion is: <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw me\n ou)=n dei= fi/lauton ei)=nai, kaqa/per ei)/rhtai w(s d) oi( polloi/, ou) xrh/</foreign>. See the note of Schweighaeuser. Epictetus, as usual, is right in his opinion of man's nature.</note> for the animal is
constituted so as to do all things for itself. For even the
sun does all things for itself; nay, even Zeus himself.
But when he chooses to be the Giver of rain and the Giver
of fruits, and the Father of Gods and men, you see that
he cannot obtain these functions and these names, if he is
not useful to man; and, universally, he has made the
nature of the rational animal such that it cannot obtain
any one of its own proper interests, if it does not contribute something to the common interest.<note anchored="yes">This has been misunderstood by Wolf. Schweighaeuser, who
always writes like a man of sense, says: <quote>Epictetus means by 'our
proper interests,' the interests proper to man, as a man, as a rational
being; and this interest or good consists in the proper use of our
powers, and so far from being repugnant to common interest or utility,
it contains within itself the notion of general utility and cannot be
separated from it.</quote></note> In this
manner and sense it is not unsociable for a man to do
every thing for the sake of himself. For what do you
expect? that a man should neglect himself and his own
interest? And how in that case can there be one and the
same principle in all animals, the principle of attachment
(regard) to themselves?</p>
<p>What then? when absurd notions about things inde-
<pb n="62"/>
pendent of our will, as if they were good and (or) bad, lie at
the bottom of our opinions, we must of necessity pay regard to tyrants; for I wish that men would pay regard to
tyrants only, and not also to the bedchamber men.<note anchored="yes">Such a man was named in Greek <foreign lang="greek">koitwni/ths</foreign>; in Latin <quote>cubicu-
larius,</quote> a lord of the bedchamber, as we might say. <placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName>, De Constantia Sapientis, c. 14, speaks <quote>of the pride of the nomenclator (the
announcer of the name), of the arrogance of the bedchamber man.</quote>
Even the clerk of the close-stool was an important person. Slaves
used to carry this useful domestic vessel on a journey. <bibl n="Hor. S. 1.6.109">Horat. Sat. i. 6, 109</bibl> (<placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>).</note> How
is it that the man becomes all at once wise, when Caesar
has made him superintendent of the close stool? How is
it that we say immediately, <quote>Felicion spoke sensibly to
me.</quote> I wish he were ejected from the bedchamber, that
he might again appear to you to be a fool.</p>
<p>Epaphroditus<note anchored="yes">Once the master of Epictetus (i. 1, 20).</note> had a shoemaker whom he sold because
he was good for nothing. This fellow by some good luck
was bought by one of Caesar's men, and became Caesar's
shoemaker. You should have seen what respect Epaphroditus paid to him: <quote>How does the good Felicion do, I
pray?</quote> Then if any of us asked, <quote>What is master
(Epaphroditus) doing?</quote> the answer was, <quote>He is consulting about something with Felicion.</quote> Had he not sold
the man as good for nothing? Who then made him wise
all at once? This is an instance of valuing something else
than the things which depend on the will.</p>
<p>Has a man been exalted to the tribuneship? All who
meet him offer their congratulations: one kisses his eyes,
another the neck, and the slaves kiss his hands.<note anchored="yes">Hand-kissing was in those times of tyranny the duty of a slave,
not of a free man. This servile practice still exists among men called
free.</note> He
goes to his house, he finds torches lighted. He ascends
the Capitol: he offers a sacrifice on the occasion. Now
who ever sacrificed for having had good desires? for having
acted conformably to nature? For in fact we thank the

Shaftesbury's emendation, <foreign lang="greek">o(/pou</foreign>. The emendation <foreign lang="greek">o(/pou</foreign> is good, but

A person was talking to me to-day about the priesthood
of Augustus.<note anchored="yes">Casaubon, in a learned note on Suetonius, <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 18">Augustus, c. 18</bibl>, informs
us that divine honours were paid to Augustus at <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName>, which town
he founded after the victory at <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>. The priesthood of Augustus
at <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName> was a high office, and the priest gave his name to the year;
that is, when it was intended in any writing to fix the year, either in
any writing which related to public matters, or in instruments used in
private affairs, the name of the priest of Augustus was used, and this
was also the practice in most Greek cities. In order to establish the
sense of this passage, Casaubon changed the text from <foreign lang="greek">ta\s fwna/s</foreign> into
<foreign lang="greek">ta\ su/mfwna</foreign>, which emendation Schweighaeuser has admitted into his
text.</note> I say to him: <quote>Man, let the thing alone:
you will spend much for no purpose.</quote> But he replies,
<quote>Those who draw up agreements will write my name.</quote>
Do you then stand by those who read them, and say to
such persons <quote>It is I whose name is written there</quote>? And
if you can now be present on all such occasions, what will
you do when you are dead? My name will remain.&mdash;

<head>About reason, how it contemplates itself.</head><note anchored="yes">A comparison of lib. i. chap. 1, will help to explain this chapter.

<p>EVERY art and faculty contemplates certain things especially.<note anchored="yes">Wolf suggests that we should read <foreign lang="greek">prohgoume/nws</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">prohgoume/nwn</foreign>.</note> When then it is itself of the same kind with the
objects which it contemplates, it must of necessity contemplate itself also: but when it is of an unlike kind, it
cannot contemplate itself. For instance, the shoemaker's
art is employed on skins, but itself is entirely distinct
from the material of skins: for this reason it does not
contemplate itself. Again, the grammarian's art is em-
<pb n="64"/>
ployed about articulate speech;<note anchored="yes">See Schweighaeuser's note.</note> is then the art also
articulate speech? By no means. For this reason it
is not able to contemplate itself. Now reason, for what
purpose has it been given by nature? For the right use
of appearances. What is it then itself? A system (combination) of certain appearances. So by its nature it has
the faculty of contemplating itself also. Again, sound
sense, for the contemplation of what things does it belong
to us? Good and evil, and things which are neither.
What is it then itself? Good. And want of sense, what
is it? Evil. Do you see then that good sense necessarily
contemplates both itself and the opposite? For this reason
it is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances, and to distinguish them, and to admit
none without examination. You see even in the matter
of coin, in which our interest appears to be somewhat concerned, how we have invented an art, and how many
means the assayer uses to try the value of coin, the sight,
the touch, the smell, and lastly the hearing. He throws
the coin (denarius) down, and observes the sound, and he
is not content with its sounding once, but through his
great attention he becomes a musician. In like manner,
where we think that to be mistaken and not to be mistaken make a great difference, there we apply great attention to discovering the things which can deceive. But
in the matter of our miserable ruling faculty, yawning and
sleeping, we carelessly admit every appearance, for the
harm is not noticed.</p>
<p>When then you would know how careless you are
with respect to good and evil, and how active with respect to things which are indifferent<note anchored="yes"><quote>We reckon death among the things which are indifferent (in-
differentia), which the Greeks name <foreign lang="greek">a)dia/fora</foreign>. But I name 'indif-
ferent' the things which are neither good nor bad, as disease, pain,
poverty, exile, death.</quote>&mdash;<placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName>, Ep. 82.</note> (neither good nor
evil), observe how you feel with respect to being deprived
of the sight of the eyes, and how with respect to being
deceived, and you will discover that you are far from
feeling as you ought to do in relation to good and evil.
But this is a matter which requires much preparation,
and much labour and study. Well then do you expect
<pb n="65"/>
to acquire the greatest of arts with small labour? And
yet the chief doctrine of philosophers is very brief. If
you would know, read Zeno's<note anchored="yes">Zeno, a native of <placeName key="tgn,7016636">Citium</placeName>, in the island of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, is said to have

are necessary. If then Epicurus should come and say,
that the good must be in the body; in this case also many
words become necessary, and we must be taught what is
the leading principle in us, and the fundamental and the
substantial; and as it is not probable that the good of
a snail is in the shell, is it probable that the good of a
man is in the body? But you yourself, Epicurus, possess
something better than this. What is that in you which
deliberates, what is that which examines every thing, what
is that which forms a judgment about the body itself, that
it is the principal part? and why do you light your lamp
and labour for us, and write so many<note anchored="yes">Epicurus is said to have written more than any other person, as

et ante percepta cujusque formae cognitio, enodationis indigens.</quote> In
the De Natura Deorum (i. 16) he says: <quote lang="la">Quae est enim gens aut quod
genus hominum, quod non habeat sine doctrina anticipationem quandam deorum, quam appellat <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyin</foreign> Epicurus? id est, anteceptam
animo rei quandam informationem, sine qua nec intelligi quidquam
nec quaeri nec disputari potest.</quote> Epicurus, as <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName> says in the
following chapter (17), was the first who used <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign> in this sense,
which Cicero applies to what he calls the ingrafted or rather innate
cognitions of the existence of gods, and these cognitions he supposes
to be universal; but whether this is so or not, I do not know. See
l. c. 2; Tuscul i. 24; De Fin. iii. 6, and <foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign> in iv. 8. 6.</note>
<p>PRAECOGNITIONS are common to all men, and praecognition
is not contradictory to praecognition. For who of us does
not assume that Good is useful and eligible, and in all circumstances that we ought to follow and pursue it? And
<pb n="67"/>
who of us does not assume that Justice is beautiful and
becoming? When then does the contradiction arise?
It arises in the adaptation of the praecognitions to the
particular cases. When one man says, He has done well:
he is a brave man, and another says, <quote>Not so; but he
has acted foolishly;</quote> then the disputes arise among men.
This is the dispute among the Jews and the Syrians and
the Egyptians and the Romans; not whether holiness<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">o(/sion</foreign>, which is very difficult to translate. We may
take an instance from ourselves. There is a general agreement about
integrity, and about the worship of the supreme being, but a wondrous
difference about certain acts or doings in trading, whether they are
consistent with integrity or not; and a still more wondrous difference
in forms of worship, whether they are conformable to religion or not.</note>
should be preferred to all things and in all cases should
be pursued, but whether it is holy to eat pig's flesh or
not holy. You will find this dispute also between Agamemnon and Achilles;<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.2">Horace, Epp. i. 2</bibl>.</note> for call them forth. What do
you say, Agamemnon? ought not that to be done which
is proper and right? Certainly. Well, what do you say,
Achilles? do you not admit that what is good ought to
be done? I do most certainly. Adapt your praecognitions then to the present matter. Here the dispute
begins. Agamemnon says, I ought not to give up
Chryseis to her father. Achilles says, You ought. It
is certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation
of the praecognition of <quote>ought</quote> or <quote>duty.</quote> Further,
Agamemnon says, Then if I ought to restore Chryseis,
it is fit that I take his prize from some of you. Achilles
replies, <quote>Would you then take her whom I love?</quote>
Yes, her whom you love. Must I then be the only man
who goes without a prize? and must I be the only man
who has no prize? Thus the dispute begins.<note anchored="yes">Iliad, i. The quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon about giving
up Chryseis to her father.</note></p>
<p>What then is education? Education is the learning
how to adapt the natural praecognitions to the particular
things conformably to nature; and then to distinguish
that of things some are in our power, but others are not:
in our power are will and all acts which depend on the
will; things not in our power are the body, the parts of
<pb n="68"/>
the body, possessions, parents, brothers, children, country
and generally, all with whom we live in society. In what
then should we place the good? To what kind of things
(<foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a|</foreign>) shall we adapt it? To the things which are in
our power? Is not health then a good thing, and
soundness of limb, and life? and are not children and
parents and country? Who will tolerate you if you deny
this?</p>
<p>Let us then transfer the notion of good to these things.
Is it possible then, when a man sustains damage and
does not obtain good things, that he can be happy? It is
not possible. And can he maintain towards society a
proper behaviour? He can not. For I am naturally
formed to look after my own interest. If it is my interest to have an estate in land, it is my interest also to
take it from my neighbour. If it is my interest to have a
garment, it is my interest also to steal it from the bath.<note anchored="yes">The bath was a place of common resort, where a thief had the
opportunity of carrying off a bather's clothes. From men's desires to
have what they have not, and do not choose to labour for, spring the
disorders of society, as it is said in the epistle of James, c. iv., v. 1, to
which Mrs. Carter refers.</note>
This is the origin of wars, civil commotions, tyrannies,
conspiracies. And how shall I be still able to maintain
my duty towards Zeus? for if I sustain damage and am
unlucky, he takes no care of me; and what is he to me
if he cannot help me; and further, what is he to me if he
allows me to be in the condition in which I am? I now
begin to hate him. Why then do we build temples, why
set up statues to Zeus, as well as to evil daemons, such
as to Fever;<note anchored="yes">See i. 19. 6, note 2.</note> and how is Zeus the Saviour, and how the
giver of rain, and the giver of fruits? And in truth if we
place the nature of Good in any such things, all this
follows.</p>
<p>What should we do then? This is the inquiry of the
true philosopher who is in labour.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName> refers to a passage in the Theaetetus (p. 150, Steph.),
where <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> professes that it is his art to discover whether a young
man's mind is giving birth to an idol (an unreality) and a falsity, or to
something productive and true; and he says (p. 151) that those who
associate with him are like women in child-birth, for they are in labour
and full of trouble nights and days much more than women, and his art has the power of stirring up and putting to rest this labour of
child-birth.
<p>The conclusion in the chapter is not clear. The student is supposed
to be addressed by some rich old man, who really does not know what
to say; and the best way of getting rid of him and his idle talk is by
dismissing him with a joke. See Schweighaeuser's note.</p></note> Now I do not see
<pb n="69"/>
what the Good is nor the Bad. Am I not mad? Yes.
But suppose that I place the good somewhere among the
things which depend on the will: all will laugh at me.
There will come some greyhead wearing many gold rings
on his fingers, and he will shake his head and say, Hear,
my child. It is right that you should philosophize; but
you ought to have some brains also: all this that you
are doing is silly. You learn the syllogism from philosophers; but you know how to act better than philosophers
do.&mdash;Man, why then do you blame me, if I know? What
shall I say to this slave? If I am silent, he will burst.
I must speak in this way: Excuse me, as you would
excuse lovers: I am not my own master: I am mad.</p></div2>

<head>Against Epicurus.</head>
<p>EVEN Epicurus perceives that we are by nature social, but
having once placed our good in the husk<note anchored="yes">That is in the body; see i. 20, 17. Compare ii. 20, at the beginning of the chapter.</note> he is no longer
able to say anything else. For on the other hand lie
strongly maintains this, that we ought not to admire nor to
accept any thing which is detached from the nature of good;
and he is right in maintaining this. How then are we
[suspicious],<note anchored="yes">The word <foreign lang="greek">u(ponohtikoi/</foreign> is not intelligible. Schweighaeuser suggests
that it ought to be <foreign lang="greek">pronohtikoi/</foreign>, <quote>how have we any care for others?</quote>
Epicurus taught that we should not marry nor beget children nor
engage in public affairs, because these things disturb our tranquillity.</note> if we have no natural affection to our children? Why do you advise the wise man not to bring up
children? Why are you afraid that he may thus fall into
<pb n="70"/>
trouble? For does he fall into trouble on account of the
mouse which is nurtured in the house? What does he care
if a little mouse in the house makes lamentation to him?
But Epicurus knows that if once a child is born, it is no
longer in our power not to love it nor care about it. For
this reason, Epicurus says, that a man who has any sense
also does not engage in political matters; for he knows
what a man must do who is engaged in such things; for
indeed, if you intend to behave among men as you would
among a swarm of flies, what hinders you? But Epicurus,
who knows this, ventures to say that we should not bring up
children. But a sheep does not desert its own offspring,
nor yet a wolf; and shall a man desert his child? What
do you mean? that we should be as silly as sheep? but not
even do they desert their offspring: or as savage as wolves,
but not even do wolves desert their young. Well, who
would follow your advice, if he saw his child weeping
after falling on the ground? For my part I think that
even if your mother and your father had been told by an
oracle, that you would say what you have said, they would
not have cast you away.</p></div2>

<p>Diogenes,<note anchored="yes">Diogenes was brought to king Philip after the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>
as a spy (iii. 22, 24). Plutarch in the treatise, Quomodo assentator ab
amico dignoscatur, c. 30, states that when Philip asked Diogenes if he
was a spy, he replied, Certainly I am a spy, Philip, of your want of
judgment and of your folly, which lead you without any necessity to
put to the hazard your kingdom and your life in one single hour.</note> who was sent as a scout before you, made a
different report to us. He says that death is no evil, for
neither is it base: he says that fame (reputation) is the
noise of madmen. And what has this spy said about pain,
about pleasure, and about poverty? He says that to be naked
is better than any purple robe, and to sleep on the bare
ground is the softest bed; and he gives as a proof of each
thing that he affirms his own courage, his tranquillity, his
freedom, and the healthy appearance and compactness of
his body. There is no enemy near, he says; all is peace.
How so, Diogenes? See, he replies, if I am struck, if I
have been wounded, if I have fled from any man. This is
what a scout ought to be. But you come to us and tell us
one thing after another. Will you not go back, and you
will see clearer when you have laid aside fear?</p>
<p>What then shall I do? What do you do when you leave
a ship? Do you take away the helm or the oars? What
then do you take away? You take what is your own, your
bottle and your wallet; and now if you think of what is
your own, you will never claim what belongs to others.

Just as we call the bed in the inn. If then the innkeeper
at his death leaves you the beds; all well; but if he leaves
them to another, he will have them, and you will seek
another bed. If then you shall not find one, you will
sleep on the ground: only sleep with a good will and

the rich and kings and tyrants, but no poor man fills a

<head>On the same.</head>
<p>IF these things are true, and if we are not silly, and are
not acting hypocritically when we say that the good of
man is in the will, and the evil too, and that every thing
else does not concern us, why are we still disturbed, why
are we still afraid? The things about which we have been
busied are in no man's power: and the things which are in
the power of others, we care not for. What kind of trouble
have we still?</p>
<p>But give me directions. Why should I give you directions? has not Zeus given you directions? Has he not
given to you what is your own free from hindrance and
free from impediment, and what is not your own subject to hindrance and impediment? What directions then,
what kind of orders did you bring when you came
from him? Keep by every means what is your own; do
not desire what belongs to others. Fidelity (integrity)
is your own, virtuous shame is your own; who then can
take these things from you? who else than yourself will
hinder you from using them? But how do you act? when
you seek what is not your own, you lose that which is your
own. Having such promptings and commands from Zeus,
what kind do you still ask from me? Am I more powerful
than he, am I more worthy of confidence? But if you
observe these, do you want any others besides? Well, but
he has not given these orders, you will say. Produce your
praecognitions (<foreign lang="greek">prolh/yeis</foreign>), produce the proofs of philosophers, produce what you have often heard, and produce
what you have said yourself, produce what you have read,
produce what you have meditated on; and you will then
see that all these things are from God.<note anchored="yes">The conclusion <quote>and you will then see,</quote> is not in the text, but
it is what Epictetus means. The argument is complete. If we admit
the existence of God, and that he is our father, as Epictetus teaches,
we have from him the intellectual powers which we possess; and
those men in whom these powers have been roused to activity, and are
exercised, require no other instructor. It is true that in a large part
of mankind these powers are inactive and are not exercised, or if they are exercised, it is in a very imperfect way. But those who contemplate the improvement of the human race, hope that all men, or if not
all men, a great number will be roused to the exercise of the powers
which they have, and that human life will be made more conformable
to Nature, that is, that man will use the powers which he has, and
will not need advice and direction from other men, who professing
that they are wise and that they can teach, prove by their teaching
and often by their example that they are not wise, and are incapable
of teaching.
<p>This is equally true for those who may deny or doubt about the
existence of God. They cannot deny that man has the intellectual
powers which he does possess; and they are certainly not the persons
who will proclaim their own want of these powers. If man has them
and can exercise them, the fact is sufficient; and we need not dispute
about the source of these powers which are in man Naturally, that is,
according to the constitution of his Nature.</p></note> How long then is

<p>For as we behave in the matter of hypothetical arguments, so ought we to do in life. Suppose it to be
night. I suppose that it is night. Well then; is it day?
No, for I admitted the hypothesis that it was night. Suppose that you think that it is night? Suppose that I do.
But also think that it is night. That is not consistent with
the hypothesis. So in this case also: Suppose that you
are unfortunate. Well, suppose so. Are you then unhappy? Yes. Well then are you troubled with an

that you are in misery. This is not consistent with the

<head>What is the law of life.</head>
<p>WHEN a person was reading hypothetical arguments,
Epictetus said, This also is an hypothetical law that we
must accept what follows from the hypothesis. But much
before this law is the law of life, that we must act conformably to nature. For if in every matter and circumstance we wish to observe what is natural, it is plain that
in every thing we ought to make it our aim that neither
that which is consequent shall escape us, and that we do
not admit the contradictory. First then philosophers
exercise us in theory<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ th=s qewri/as</foreign>. <quote>Intelligere quid verum rectumque sit, prius

&mdash;Wolf.
<p>This is a profound and useful remark of Epictetus. General principles are most easily understood and accepted. The difficulty is in
the application of them. What is more easy, for example, than to
understand general principles of law which are true and good? But
in practice cases are presented to us which as Bacon says, are <quote>immersed in matter;</quote> and it is this matter which makes the difficulty
of applying the principles, and requires the ability and study of
an experienced man. It is easy, and it is right, to teach the young
the general principles of the rules of life; but the difficulty of applying them is that in which the young and the old too often fail.
So if you ask whether virtue can be taught, the answer is that the
rules for a virtuous life can be delivered; but the application of the
rules is the difficulty, as teachers of religion and morality know well,
if they are fit to teach. If they do not know this truth, they are
neither fit to teach the rules, nor to lead the way to the practice of
them by the only method which is possible; and this method is by
their own example, assisted by the example of those who direct the
education of youth, and of those with whom young persons live.</p></note>(contemplation of things), which is
easier; and then next they lead us to the more difficult
things; for in theory, there is nothing which draws us
away from following what is taught; but in the matters
of life, many are the things which distract us. He is
ridiculous then who says that he wishes to begin with the
matters of real life, for it is not easy to begin with the
more difficult things; and we ought to employ this fact as
an argument to those parents who are vexed at their
children learning philosophy: Am I doing wrong then

my father, and do I not know what is suitable to me and
becoming? If indeed this can neither be learned nor
taught, why do you blame me? but if it can be taught,
teach me; and if you can not, allow me to learn from those
who say that they know how to teach. For what do you
think? do you suppose that I voluntarily fall into evil
and miss the good? I hope that it may not be so. What
is then the cause of my doing wrong? Ignorance. Do
you not choose then that I should get rid of my ignorance?
Who was ever taught by anger the art of a pilot or music?
Do you think then that by means of your anger I shall

Epictetus said to the teacher, <quote>You are laughing at yourself: you did not prepare the young man nor did you
ascertain whether he was able to understand these matters;
but perhaps, you are only employing him as a reader.</quote>
Well then said Epictetus, if a man has not ability
enough to understand a complex (syllogism), do we trust
him in giving praise, do we trust him in giving blame,
do we allow that he is able to form a judgment about good
or bad? and if such a man blames any one, does the man
care for the blame? and if he praises any one, is the man
elated, when in such small matters as an hypothetical

<head>In how many ways appearances exist, and what aids we should provide against them.</head>
<p>APPEARANCES are to us in four ways: for either things
appear as they are; or they are not, and do not even
appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to be; or
they are not, and yet appear to be. Further, in all these
cases to form a right judgment (to hit the mark) is the
office of an educated man. But whatever it is that annoys
(troubles) us, to that we ought to apply a remedy. If the
sophisms of Pyrrho<note anchored="yes">Pyrrho was a native of <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>, in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. He is said to

Ethic; Lecture III., On the grounds of Scepticism.</p></note> and of the Academics are what annoys
(troubles), we must apply the remedy to them. If it is
the persuasion of appearances, by which some things
appear to be good, when they are not good, let us seek a
remedy for this. If it is habit which annoys us, we must
try to seek aid against habit. What aid then can we find
against habit? The contrary habit. You hear the ignorant say: <quote>That unfortunate person is dead: his father and
mother are overpowered with sorrow;<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)pw/leto</foreign> does not mean that the father is dead, and that the
mother is dead. They survive and lament. Compare Euripides,

<p>When death appears an evil, we ought to have this rule

death is a necessary thing. For what shall I do, and
where shall I escape it? Suppose that I am not Sarpedon,<note anchored="yes">Homer, <placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName>, xii. v. 328: <foreign lang="greek">i)/omen, h)e\ tw| eu)xos o)re/comen h)=e/ tis h(mi=n</foreign>.</note>
the son of Zeus, nor able to speak in this noble way: I
will go and I am resolved either to behave bravely
myself or to give to another the opportunity of doing so;
if I cannot succeed in doing any thing myself, I will not
grudge another the doing of something noble.&mdash;Suppose
that it is above our power to act thus; is it not in our
power to reason thus? Tell me where I can escape death:
discover for me the country, show me the men to whom I
must go, whom death does not visit. Discover to me a
charm against death. If I have not one, what do you wish
me to do? I cannot escape from death. Shall I not escape
from the fear of death, but shall I die lamenting and
trembling? For the origin of perturbation is this, to
wish for something, and that this should not happen.
Therefore if I am able to change externals according to
my wish, I change them; but if I can not, I am ready to
tear out the eyes of him who hinders me. For the nature
of man is not to endure to be deprived of the good, and
not to endure the falling into the evil. Then at last, when
I am neither able to change circumstances nor to tear out
the eyes of him who hinders me, I sit down and groan, and
abuse whom I can, Zeus and the rest of the gods. For if
they do not care for me, what are they to me?&mdash;Yes, but
you will be an impious man.&mdash;In what respect then will
it be worse for me than it is now?&mdash;To sum up, remember
this that unless piety and your interest be in the same

<head>That we ought not to be angry with men; and what are the small and the great things among men.</head><note anchored="yes">See c. 18 of this book.</note>
<p>WHAT is the cause of assenting to any thing? The fact
that it appears to be true. It is not possible then to
assent to that which appears not to be true. Why?
Because this is the nature of the understanding, to incline
to the true, to be dissatisfied with the false, and in matters
uncertain to withhold assent. What is the proof of this?
Imagine (persuade yourself), if you can, that it is now
night. It is not possible. Take away your persuasion that
it is day. It is not possible. Persuade yourself or take
away your persuasion that the stars are even in number.<note anchored="yes">We cannot conceive that the number of stars is either even or
odd. The construction of the word <foreign lang="greek">a)popa/sxein</foreign> is uncertain, for, says
Schweighaeuser, the word is found only here.</note>
It is impossible. When then any man assents to that
which is false, be assured that he did not intend to assent
to it as false, for every soul is unwillingly deprived of the
truth, as Plato says; but the falsity seemed to him to be
true. Well, in acts what have we of the like kind as we
have here truth or falsehood? We have the fit and the
not fit (duty and not duty), the profitable and the unprofitable, that which is suitable to a person and that which is
not, and whatever is like these. Can then a man think
that a thing is useful to him and not choose it? He cannot. How says Medea?<note anchored="yes">The Medea of Euripides, <date value="1079">1079</date>, <quote>where, instead of <foreign lang="greek">dra=n me/llw</foreign> of

She thought that to indulge her passion and take vengeance on her husband was more profitable than to spare

plainly that she is deceived, and she will not do it; but so
long as you do not show it, what can she follow except
<pb n="84"/>
that which appears to herself (her opinion)? Nothing
else. Why then are you angry with the unhappy
woman that she has been bewildered about the most important things, and is become a viper instead of human
creature? And why not, if it is possible, rather pity, as
we pity the blind and the lame, so those who are blinded
and maimed in the faculties which are supreme?</p>
<p>Whoever then clearly remembers this, that to man the
measure of every act is the appearance (the opinion),&mdash;
whether the thing appears good or bad: if good, he is free
from blame; if bad, himself suffers the penalty, for it is
impossible that he who is deceived can be one person, and
he who suffers another person&mdash;whoever remembers this
will not be angry with any man, will not be vexed at any
man, will not revile or blame any man, nor hate nor
quarrel with any man.</p>
<p>So then all these great and dreadful deeds have this
origin, in the appearance (opinion)? Yes, this origin and
no other. The <placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName> is nothing else than appearance and
the use of appearances. It appeared<note anchored="yes">This is the literal version. It does not mean <quote>that it appeared
right,</quote> as Mrs. Carter translates it. Alexander never thought whether
it was right or wrong. All that appeared to him was the possessing
of <placeName key="tgn,2384414">Helene</placeName>, and he used the means for getting possession of her, as a
dog who spies and pursues some wild animal.</note> to Alexander to carry
off the wife of Menelaus: it appeared to <placeName key="tgn,2384414">Helene</placeName> to follow
him. If then it had appeared to Menelaus to feel that it
was a gain to be deprived of such a wife, what would have
happened? Not only would the <placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName> have been lost,
but the Odyssey also. On so small a matter then did
such great things depend? But what do you mean by such
great things? Wars and civil commotions, and the destruction of many men and cities. And what great matter
is this? Is it nothing?&mdash;But what great matter is the
death of many oxen, and many sheep, and many nests of
swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed? Are these
things then like those? Very like. Bodies of men are
destroyed, and the bodies of oxen and sheep; the dwellings of men are burnt, and the nests of storks. What is
there in this great or dreadful? Or show me what is the
difference between a man's house and a stork's nest, as far
<pb n="85"/>
as each is a dwelling; except that man builds his little
houses of beams and tiles and bricks, and the stork builds
them of sticks and mud. Are a stork and a man then
like things? What say you?&mdash;In body they are very much
alike.</p>
<p>Does a man then differ in no respect from a stork?
Don't suppose that I say so; but there is no difference in
these matters (which I have mentioned). In what then
is the difference? Seek and you will find that there is a
difference in another matter. See whether it is not in a
man the understanding of what he does, see if it is not in
social community, in fidelity, in modesty, in steadfastness,
in intelligence. Where then is the great good and evil in
men? It is where the difference is. If the difference is
preserved and remains fenced round, and neither modesty
is destroyed, nor fidelity, nor intelligence, then the man
also is preserved; but if any of these things is destroyed
and stormed like a city, then the man too perishes;
and in this consist the great things. Alexander, you
say, sustained great damage then when the Hellenes
invaded and when they ravaged <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, and when his
brothers perished. By no means; for no man is damaged
by an action which is not his own; but what happened
at that time was only the destruction of storks' nests:
now the ruin of Alexander was when he lost the character of modesty, fidelity, regard to hospitality, and to
decency. When was Achilles ruined? Was it when
Patroclus died? Not so. But it happened when he began
to be angry, when he wept for a girl, when he forgot that
he was at <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> not to get mistresses, but to fight. These
things are the ruin of men, this is being besieged, this is
the destruction of cities, when right opinions are destroyed,
when they are corrupted.</p>
<p>When then women are carried off, when children are
made captives, and when the men are killed, are these not
evils? How is it then that you add to the facts these
opinions? Explain this to me also.&mdash;I shall not do that;
but how is it that you say that these are not evils?&mdash;Let
us come to the rules: produce the praecognitions (<foreign lang="greek">prolh/yeis</foreign>): for it is because this is neglected that we can not
sufficiently wonder at what men do. When we intend to
<pb n="86"/>
judge of weights, we do not judge by guess: where we
intend to judge of straight and crooked, we do not judge
by guess. In all cases where it is our interest to know
what is true in any matter, never will any man among us
do anything by guess. But in things which depend on
the first and on the only cause of doing right or wrong, of
happiness or unhappiness, of being unfortunate or fortunate, there only we are inconsiderate and rash. There
is then nothing like scales (balance), nothing like a rule:
but some appearance is presented, and straightway I act
according to it. Must I then suppose that I am superior to
Achilles or Agamemnon, so that they by following appearances do and suffer so many evils: and shall not the
appearance be sufficient for me?<note anchored="yes">Schweighaeuser proposes to erase <foreign lang="greek">mh\</foreign> from the text, but it is, I
suppose, in all the MSS.: and it is easy to explain the passage without erasing the, <foreign lang="greek">mh\</foreign>.</note>&mdash;And what tragedy has
any other beginning? The Atreus of Euripides, what is
it? An appearance.<note anchored="yes">The expression <foreign lang="greek">to\ faino/menon</foreign> often occurs in this chapter, and it is
sometimes translated by the Latin <quote>sententia</quote> or <quote>opinio</quote>: and so it

(s. 30) <foreign lang="greek">a)lla\ ti/ e)fa/nh, kai\ ei)qu\s poiw= to\ fane/n</foreign>: which means that there
was an appearance, which was followed by the act. The word generally used by Epictetus is <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, which occurs very often. In the
Encheiridion (i. 5) there is some difference between <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">to\ faino/menon</foreign>, for they are contrasted: <foreign lang="greek">to\ faino/menon</foreign> is the phenomenon,

it? An appearance. The Phoenix? An appearance.
The Hippolytus? An appearance. What kind of a man
then do you suppose him to be who pays no regard to this
matter? And what is the name of those who follow every
appearance? They are called madmen. Do we then act
at all differently?

(overvalue) the materials; for the opinions about the

but perverse and distorted opinions make the will bad.
God has fixed this law, and says, <quote>If you would have any
thing good, receive it from yourself.</quote> You say, No, but
I will have it from another.&mdash;Do not so: but receive it
from yourself. Therefore when the tyrant threatens and
calls me, I say, Whom do you threaten? If he says,
I will put you in chains, I say, You threaten my
hands and my feet. If he says, I will cut off your
head, I reply, You threaten my head. If he says, I
will throw you into prison, I say, You threaten the
whole of this poor body. If he threatens me with
banishment, I say the same. Does he then not threaten
you at all? If I feel that all these things do not concern
me, he does not threaten me at all; but if I fear any of
them, it is I whom he threatens. Whom then do I fear?
the master of what? The master of things which are in
my own power? There is no such master. Do I fear the
<pb n="88"/>
master of things which are not in my power? And what
are these things to me?</p>
<p>Do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings?
I hope not. Who among us teaches to claim against them
the power over things which they possess? Take my
poor body, take my property, take my reputation, take
those who are about me. If I advise any persons to claim
these things, they may truly accuse me.&mdash;Yes, but I intend
to command your opinions also.&mdash;And who has given you
this power? How can you conquer the opinion of another
man? By applying terror to it, he replies, I will conquer
it. Do you not know that opinion conquers itself,<note anchored="yes">This is explained by what follows. Opinion does not really conquer itself; but one opinion can conquer another, and nothing else can.</note> and is
not conquered by another? But nothing else can conquer
Will except the Will itself. For this reason too the law
of God is most powerful and most just, which is this: Let
the stronger always be superior to the weaker. Ten are
stronger than one. For what? For putting in chains,
for killing, for dragging whither they choose, for taking
away what a man has. The ten therefore conquer the one
in this in which they are stronger. In what then are the
ten weaker? If the one possesses right opinions and the
others do not. Well then, can the ten conquer in this
matter? How is it possible? If we were placed in the
scales, must not the heavier draw down the scale in which
it is.</p>
<p>How strange then that <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> should have been so

<p>But show me that he who has the inferior principles
overpowers him who is superior in principles. You will
never show this, nor come near showing it; for this is the
law of nature and of God that the superior shall always
overpower the inferior. In what? In that in which it is
superior. One body is stronger than another: many are
stronger than one: the thief is stronger than he who is
not a thief. This is the reason why I also lost my lamp,<note anchored="yes">See i. 18, 15, p. 58.</note>
because in wakefulness the thief was superior to me. But
the man bought the lamp at this price: for a lamp he
became a thief, a faithless fellow, and like a wild beast.
This seemed to him a good bargain. Be it so. But a
man has seized me by the cloak, and is drawing me to the
public place: then others bawl out, Philosopher, what
has been the use of your opinions? see you are dragged
to prison, you are going to be beheaded. And what
system of philosophy (<foreign lang="greek">ei)sagwgh/n</foreign>) could I have made so
that, if a stronger man should have laid hold of my cloak,
I should not be dragged off; that if ten men should have
laid hold of me and cast me into prison, I should not be

not new, and it may have been used by the Stoic writers long before
his time. The language of the Stoics was formed at least two centuries before the <placeName key="tgn,2000780">Christian</placeName> aera, and the New Testament writers would
use the Greek which was current in their age. The notion of <quote>Scripture language coming early into common use</quote> is entirely unfounded,
and is even absurd. Mrs. Carter's remark implies that Epictetus used
the Scripture language, whereas he used the particular language of
the Stoics, and the general language of his age, and the New Testament writers would do the same. There are resemblances between
the language of Epictetus and the New Testament writers, such as
the expression <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ge/noito</foreign> of Paul, which Epictetus often uses; but this
is a slight matter. The words of Peter (Ep. ii. 1, 4), <quote>that by these

<head>That confidence (courage) is not inconsistent with caution.</head>
<p>THE opinion of the philosophers perhaps seems to some to
be a paradox; but still let us examine as well as we can,
if it is true that it is possible to do every thing both with
caution and with confidence. For caution seems to be in
a manner contrary to confidence, and contraries are in no
way consistent. That which seems to many to be a paradox in the matter under consideration in my opinion is of
this kind: if we asserted that we ought to employ caution
and confidence in the same things, men might justly
accuse us of bringing together things which cannot be
united. But now where is the difficulty in what is said?
for if these things are true, which have been often said
and often proved, that the nature of good is in the use of
appearances, and the nature of evil likewise, and that
things independent of our will do not admit either the
nature of evil nor of good, what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say that where things are not
dependent on the will, there you should employ confidence,
but where they are dependent on the will, there you
should employ caution? For if the bad consists in a bad
exercise of the will, caution ought only to be used where
things are dependent on the will. But if things independent of the will and not in our power are nothing to
us, with respect to these we must employ confidence; and
<pb n="98"/>
thus we shall both be cautious and confident, and indeed
confident because of our caution. For by employing
caution towards things which are really bad, it will result
that we shall have confidence with respect to things which
are not so.</p>
<p>We are then in the condition of deer;<note anchored="yes">It was the fashion of hunters to frighten deer by displaying fathers
of various colours on ropes or strings and thus frightening them towards

<lg>
<l>Puniceaeve agitant pavidos formidine pennae,</l></lg></note> when they flee
from the huntsmen's feathers in fright, whither do they
turn and in what do they seek refuge as safe? They turn
to the nets, and thus they perish by confounding things
which are objects of fear with things that they ought not
to fear. Thus we also act: in what cases do we fear? In
things which are independent of the will. In what cases
on the contrary do we behave with confidence, as if there
were no danger? In things dependent on the will. To
be deceived then, or to act rashly, or shamelessly or with
base desire to seek something, does not concern us at all,
if we only hit the mark in things which are independent
of our will. But where there is death, or exile or pain or
infamy, there we attempt to run away, there we are struck
with terror. Therefore as we may expect it to happen
with those who err in the greatest matters, we convert
natural confidence (that is, according to nature) into
audacity, desperation, rashness, shamelessness; and we
convert natural caution and modesty into cowardice and
meanness, which are full of fear and confusion. For if a
man should transfer caution to those things in which the
will may be exercised and the acts of the will, he will
immediately by willing to be cautious have also the power
of avoiding what he chooses: but if he transfer it to the
things which are not in his power and will, and attempt
to avoid the things which are in the power of others, he
will of necessity fear, he will be unstable, he will be dis-
turbed. For death or pain is not formidable, but the fear
of pain or death. For this reason we commend the poet<note anchored="yes">Euripides, fragments.</note>
who said
<quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
<l>Not death is evil, but a shameful death.</l></lg></quote>
<pb n="99"/>
Confidence (courage) then ought to be employed against
death, and caution against the fear of death. But now we
do the contrary, and employ against death the attempt to
escape; and to our opinion about it we employ carelessness, rashness and indifference. These things <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName><note anchored="yes">In the Phaedon, c. 24, or p. 78.</note>
properly used to call tragic masks; for as to children
masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience, we
also are affected in like manner by events (the things
which happen in life) for no other reason than children
are by masks. For what is a child? Ignorance. What
is a child? Want of knowledge. For when a child knows
these things, he is in no way inferior to us. What is
death? A tragic mask. Turn it and examine it. See, it
does not bite. The poor body must be separated<note anchored="yes">It was the opinion of some philosophers that the soul was a portion

doctrine of all existing things perishing in the course of time and then

men. But for the few who are able to embrace in thought the past,
the present and the future, the contemplation of the perishable nature,
of all existing things may have a certain value by elevating their minds

does not satisfy (please) you, the door is open:<note anchored="yes">Sec. i. 9, note 7. Schweighaeuser says that he does not quite see
what is the meaning of 'ought to be open'; and he suggests that
Epictetus intended to say 'we ought to consider that the door is open
for all occasions'; but the occasions, he says, ought to be when things
are such that a man can in no way bear them or cannot honourably
endure them, and such occasions the wise man considers to be the voice
of God giving to him the sign' to retire.</note> if it

does, bear (with things). For the door ought to be open
for all occasions; and so we have no trouble.</p>
<p>What then is the fruit of these opinions? It is that
which ought to be the most noble and the most becoming
to those who are really educated, release from perturbation, release from fear, freedom. For in these matters we
must not believe the many, who say that free persons only
ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that the educated only are free. How is
this? In this manner. Is freedom any thing else than the
power of living as we choose? Nothing else. Tell me then,
ye men, do you wish to live in error? We do not. No one
then who lives in error is free. Do you wish to live in fear?
Do you wish to live in sorrow? Do you wish to live in perturbation? By no means. No one then who is in a state
of fear or sorrow or perturbation is free; but whoever is
delivered from sorrows and fears and perturbations, he is
at the same time also delivered from servitude. How then
can we continue to believe you, most dear legislators, when
you say, We only allow free persons to be educated? For
philosophers say we allow none to be free except the
educated; that is, God does not allow it. When then a

<head>Against a person who had once been detected in adultery.</head>
<p>As Epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity,
and that he who subverts fidelity subverts the peculiar
characteristic of men, there entered one of those who are
considered to be men of letters, who had once been
detected in adultery in the city. Then Epictetus continued, But if we lay aside this fidelity for which we are
formed and make designs against our neighbour's wife,
what are we doing? What else but destroying and overthrowing? Whom, the man of fidelity, the man of
modesty, the man of sanctity. Is this all? And are we
not overthrowing neighbourhood, and friendship, and the
community; and in what place are we putting ourselves?
How shall I consider you, man? As a neighbour, as a
friend? What kind of one? As a citizen? Wherein shall
I trust you? So if you were an utensil so worthless that a
man could not use you, you would be pitched out on the
dung heaps, and no man would pick you up. But if
being a man you are unable to fill any place which befits
a man, what shall we do with you? For suppose that
you cannot hold the place of a friend, can you hold the
place of a slave? And who will trust you? Are you not
then content that you also should be pitched somewhere
on a dung heap, as a useless utensil, and a bit of dung?
Then will you say, no man cares for me, a man of letters?
They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just
as if the wasps complained because no man cares for
them, but all fly from them, and if a man can, he strikes
them and knocks them down. You have such a sting
that you throw into trouble and pain any man that you
wound with it. What would you have us do with you?
You have no place where you can be put.</p>

Externals are not in my power: will is in my power.
Where shall I seek the good and the bad? Within, in the
things which are my own. But in what does not belong
to you call nothing either good or bad, or profit or damage
or any thing of the kind.</p>
<p>What then? Should we use such things carelessly?
In no way: for this on the other hand is bad for the
faculty of the will, and consequently against nature; but
we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent,
and we should also act with firmness and freedom from
perturbations because the material is indifferent. For
where the material is not indifferent, there no man can
hinder me nor compel me. Where I can be hindered and
compelled, the obtaining of those things is not in my power,
nor is it good or bad; but the use is either bad or good,
and the use is in my power. But it is difficult to mingle
and to bring together these two things, the carefulness of
him who is affected by the matter (or things about him)
and the firmness of him who has no regard for it; but it
is not impossible: and if it is, happiness is impossible.
But we should act as we do in the case of a voyage. What
can I do? I can choose the master of the ship, the sailors,
the day, the opportunity. Then comes a storm. What
more have I to care for? for my part is done. The business belongs to another, the master.&mdash;But the ship is sinking&mdash;what then have I to do? I do the only thing that
I can, not to be drowned fill of fear, nor screaming nor
blaming God, but knowing that what has been produced
must also perish: for I am not an immortal being, but a
man, a part of the whole, as an hour is a part of the day;
<pb n="110"/>
I must be present like the hour, and past like the hour.
What difference then does it make to me, how I pass
away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for I
must pass through some such means?</p>
<p>This is just what you will see those doing who play at
ball skilfully. No one cares about the ball<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">a(rpasto/n</foreign>, which was also used by the Romans. One
threw the ball and the other caught it. Chrysippus used this simile of
a ball in speaking of giving and receiving (<placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName>, De Beneficiis,
ii. 17). Martial has the word (Epig. iv. 19) 'Sive harpasta manu
pulverulenta rapis'; and elsewhere.</note> as being
good or bad, but about throwing and catching it. In this
therefore is the skill, in this the art, the quickness, the
judgment, so that even if I spread out my lap I may not
be able to catch it, and another, if I throw, may catch the
ball. But if with perturbation and fear we receive or
throw the ball, what kind of play is it then, and wherein
shall a man be steady, and how shall a man see the order
in the game? But one will say, Throw; or Do not throw;
and another will say, You have thrown once. This is
quarrelling, not play.</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> then knew how to play at ball. How? By
using pleasantry in the court where he was tried. Tell
me, he says, Anytus, how do you say that I do not believe
in God. The Daemons (<foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>), who are they, think
you? Are they not sons of Gods, or compounded of gods

it would be equally absurd if a man should believe that there are foals

asses. But <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> says nothing of mules, for the word mules in sore?
texts of the Apology is manifestly wrong</note> And what was the ball in that case?
Life, chains, banishment, a draught of poison, separation
from wife and leaving children orphans. These were the
things with which he was playing; but still he did play
and threw the ball skilfully. So we should do: we must
employ all the care of the players, but show the same
indifference about the ball. For we ought by all means
<pb n="111"/>
to apply our art to some external material, not as valuing
the material, but, whatever it may be, showing our art in
it. Thus too the weaver does not make wool, but exercises
his art upon such as he receives. Another gives you food
and property and is able to take them away and your poor
body also. When then you have received the material,
work on it. If then you come out (of the trial) without
having suffered any thing, all who meet you will congratulate you on your escape; but he who knows how to look
at such things, if he shall see that you have behaved
properly in the matter, will commend you and be pleased
with you; and if he shall find that you owe your escape
to any want of proper behaviour, he will do the contrary.
For where rejoicing is reasonable, there also is congratulation reasonable.</p>
<p>How then is it said that some external things are
according to nature and others contrary to nature? It is
said as it might be said if we were separated from union
(or society). for to the foot I shall say that it is according to nature for it to be clean; but if you take it as a
foot and as a thing not detached (independent), it will
befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns, and
sometimes to be cut off for the good of the whole body;
otherwise it is no longer a foot. We should think in some
such way about ourselves alsc. What are you? A man.
If you consider yourself as detached from other men, it is
according to nature to live to old age, to be rich, to be
healthy. But if you consider yourself as a man and a
part of a certain whole, it is for the sake of that whole
that at one time you should be sick, at another time take
a voyage and run into danger, and at another time be in
want, and in some cases die prematurely. Why then are
you troubled? Do you not know, that as a foot is no
longer a foot if it is detached from the body, so you are
no longer a man if you are separated from other men.

about it is not indifferent, but it is either knowledge or

indifferent. When any man then tells you that these
things also are indifferent, do not become negligent; and
when a man invites you to be careful (about such things),
do not become abject and struck with admiration of material things. And it is good for you to know your own
preparation and power, that in those matters where you

vexed, if others have the advantage over you. For you
too in syllogisms will claim to have the advantage over
them; and if others should be vexed at this, you will
console them by saying, 'I have learned them, and you
have not.' Thus also where there is need of any practice,
seek not that which is acquired from the need (of such
practice), but yield in that matter to those who have had
practice, and be yourself content with firmness of mind.</p>

well, So long as future things are uncertain, I always
cling to those which are more adapted to the conservation
of that which is according to nature; for God himself has

one of the examples of extravagant assertion in Epictetus. A tyrant
may kill by a slow death as a fever does. I suppose that Epictetus
would have some answer to that. Except to a Stoic the ways to death
are not indifferent: some ways of dying are painful, and even he who
can endure with fortitude, would prefer an easy death.</note> But if you will listen to the truth, the way which

<head>How we ought to use divination.</head>
<p>THROUGH an unreasonable regard to divination many of
us omit many duties.<note anchored="yes">Divination was a great part of antient religion, and, as Epictetus
says, it led men 'to omit many duties.' In a certain sense there was
some meaning in it. If it is true that those who believe in God can
see certain signs in the administration of the world by which they can
judge what their behaviour ought to be, they can learn what their
duties are. If these signs are misunderstood, or if they are not seen
right, men may be governed by an abject superstition. So the external
forms of any religion may become the means of corruption and of human
debasement, and the true indications of God's will may be neglected.
<placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName> compares Lucan (ix. 572), who sometimes said a few good
things.</note> For what more can the diviner
see than death or danger or disease, or generally things of
that kind? If then I must expose myself to danger for a
friend, and if it is my duty even to die for him, what need
have I then for divination? Have I not within me a
diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil,
and has explained to me the signs (or marks) of both?
What need have I then to consult the viscera of victims or
the flight of birds, and why do I submit when he says, It
is for your interest? For does he know what is for my
interest, does he know what is good; and as he has
learned the signs of the viscera, has he also learned the
signs of good and evil? For if he knows the signs of
these, he knows the signs both of the beautiful and of the
ugly, and of the just and of the unjust. Do you tell me,
man, what is the thing which is signified for me: is it life
or death, poverty or wealth? But whether these things

thing of which many know something. A man who gives his opinion
on divination or on future events, gives an opinion on things of which
we all know nothing. When then a man affects to instruct on things
unknown, we may ask him to give his opinion on things which are
known, and so we may learn what kind of man he is.</note> The woman therefore, who intended to

<p>What then leads us to frequent use of divination?
Cowardice, the dread of what will happen. This is the
reason why we flatter the diviners. Pray, master, shall I
succeed to the property of my father? Let us see: let us
sacrifice on the occasion.&mdash;Yes, master, as fortune chooses.

we thank him as if we received the inheritance from him.

<p>What then should we do? We ought to come (to divination) without desire or aversion, as the wayfarer asks of
the man whom he meets which of two roads leads (to his
journey's end), without any desire for that which leads to
the right rather than to the left, for he has no wish to go by
any road except the road which leads (to his end). In the
same way ought we to come to God also as a guide; as we
use our eyes, not asking them to show us rather such
things as we wish, but receiving the appearances of
things such as the eyes present them to us. But now we

land? By no means. Fame? No. Is it intelligence,
knowledge, right reason? Yes. Herein then simply seek
the nature of the good; for I suppose that you do not seek
it in a plant. No. Do you seek it in an irrational
animal? No. If then you seek it in a rational animal,
why do you still seek it any where except in the supe-
riority of rational over irrational animals?<note anchored="yes">Compare <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>, de Office. i. 27.</note> Now plants
have not even the power of using appearances, and for this
reason you do not apply the term good to them. The
good then requires the use of appearances. Does it re-
quire this use only? For if you say that it requires this
use only, say that the good, and that happiness and unhap-
piness are in irrational animals also. But you do not say
this, and you do right; for if they possess even in the
highest degree the use of appearances, yet they have not
the faculty of understanding the use of appearances; and
there is good reason for this, for they exist for the purpose
of serving others, and they exercise no superiority. For
the ass, I suppose, does not exist for any superiority over
others. No; but because we had need of a back which is
able to bear something; and in truth we had need also of
his being able to walk, and for this reason he received
also the faculty of making use of appearances, for other
<pb n="119"/>
wise he would not have been able to walk. And here then
the matter stopped. For if he had also received the faculty
of comprehending the use of appearances, it is plain that
consistently with reason he would not then have beer
subjected to us, nor would he have done us these services,
but he would have been equal to us and like to us.</p>
<p>Will you not then seek the nature of good in the
rational animal? for if it is not there, you will not choose
to say that it exists in any other thing (plant or animal).
What then? are not plants and animals also the works of
God? They are; but they are not superior things, nor
yet parts of the Gods. But you are a superior thing; you
are a portion separated from the deity; you have in yourself a certain portion of him. Why then are you ignorant

Wretch, you are carrying about a god with you, and you
know it not.<note anchored="yes">Mrs. Carter has a note here. 'See 1 Cor. vi. 19, 2 Cor. vi. 16,
2 Tim. i. 14, 1 John iii. 24, iv. 12, 13. But though the simple expression
of carrying God about with us may seem to have some nearly parallel
to it in the New Testament, yet those represent the Almighty in a more
venerable manner, as taking the hearts of good men for a temple to
dwell in. But the other expressions here of feeding and exercising
God, and the whole of the paragraph, and indeed of the Stoic system,
show the real sense of even its more decent phrases to be vastly
different from that of Scripture.'
<p>The passage in 1 Cor. vi. 19 is, 'What? know ye not that your
body is the temple of the <placeName key="tgn,2396674">Holy Ghost</placeName> which is in you, which ye have
of God and ye are not your own'? This follows v. 18, which is an
exhortation to 'flee fornication. The passage in 2 Cor. vi. 16 is 'And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them
and walk in them,' etc. Mrs. Carter has not correctly stated the sense
of these two passages.</p>
<p>It is certain that Epictetus knew nothing of the writers of the
Epistles in the New Testament; but whence did these writers learn
such forms of expression as we find in the passages cited by Mrs.
Carter? I believe that they drew them from the Stoic philosophers who
wrote before Epictetus and that they applied them to the new religion
which they were teaching. The teaching of Paul and of Epictetus
does not differ: the spirit of God is in man.</p>
<p>Swedenborg says, 'In these two faculties (rationality and liberty)
the Lord resides with every man, whether he be good or evil, they being
the Lord's mansions in the human race. But the mansion of the Lord
is nearer with a man, in proportion as the man opens the superior
degrees by these faculties; for by the opening thereof he comes into
superior degrees of love and wisdom, and consequently nearer to the
Lord. Hence it may appear that as these degrees are opened, so a man
is in the Lord and the Lord in him.' Swedeuborg, Angelic Wisdom,
240. Again, 'the faculty of thinking rationally, viewed in itself, is not
man's, but God's in man.'</p>
<p>I am not quite sure in what sense the administration of the Eucharist
ought to be understood in the church of <placeName key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> service. Some English
divines formerly understood, and perhaps some now understand, the
ceremony as a commemoration of the blood of Christ shed for us and of
his body which was broken; as we see in T. Burnet's Posthumous work
(de Fide et Officiis Christianorum, p. 80). It was a commemoration of
the last supper of Jesus and the Apostles. But this does not appear to
be the sense in which the ceremony is now understood by some priests
and by some members of the church of <placeName key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, whose notions approach
near to the doctrine of the Catholic mass. Nor does it appear to be the
sense of the prayer made before delivering the bread and wine to the
Communicants, for the prayer is 'Grant us, gracious Lord, so to eat the
flesh of thy dear son Jesus Christ and to drink his blood that our sinful
bodies may be made clean by his body and our souls washed through
his most precious blood and that we may evermore dwell in him and he
in us.' This is a different thing from Epictetus' notion of God being in
man, and also different, as I understand it, from the notion contained in
the two passages of Paul; for it is there said generally that the Holy
Ghost is in man or God in man, not that God is in man by virtue of a
particular ceremony. It should not be omitted that there is after the
end of the Communion service an admonition that the sacramental bread
and wine remain what they were, 'and that the natural body and blood
of our Saviour Christ are in heaven and not here; it being against the
truth of Christ's natural body to be at one time in more places than one.'
It was affirmed by the Reformers and the best writers of the English
church that the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is a spiritual presence, and in this opinion they followed <placeName key="tgn,2086930">Calvin</placeName> and the Swiss divines:
and yet in the Prayer book we have the language that I have quoted;
and even Calvin, who only maintained a spiritual presence, said, 'that
the verity is nevertheless joined to the signs, and that in the sacrament
we have <quote>true Communion in Christ's body and blood'</quote> (Contemporary Review, p. 464, August <date value="1874-08">1874</date>). What would Epictetus have
thought of the subtleties of our days?</p></note> Do you think that I mean some God of
<pb n="120"/>
silver or of gold, and external? You carry him within
yourself, and you perceive not that you are polluting him
<pb n="121"/>
by impure thoughts and dirty deeds. And if an image of
God were present, you would not dare to do any of the
things which you are doing: but when God himself is
present within and sees all and hears all, you are not
ashamed of thinking such things and doing such things,
ignorant as you are of your own nature and subject to the
anger of God. Then why do we fear when we are sending a young man from the school into active life, lest he
should do anything improperly, eat improperly, have
improper intercourse with women; and lest the rags in
which he is wrapped should debase him, lest fine garments
should make him proud? This youth (if he acts thus)
does not know his own God: he knows not with whom he
sets out (into the world). But can we endure when he
says' I wish I had you (God) with me.' Have you not
God with you? and do you seek for any other, when you
have him? or will God tell you any thing else than this?
If you were a statue of Phidias, either Athena or Zeus, you
would think both of yourself and of the artist, an if you
had any understanding (power of perception) you would
try to do nothing unworthy of him who made you or of
yourself, and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress
(attitude) to those who look on you. But now because
Zeus has made you, for this reason do you care not how you
shall appear? And yet is the artist (in the one case) like
the artist in the other? or the work in the one case like
the other? And what work of an artist, for instance, has
in itself the faculties, which the artist shows in making
it? Is it not marble or bronze, or gold or ivory? and the
Athena of Phidias when she has once extended the hand
and received in it the figure of Victory<note anchored="yes">The Athena of Phidias was in the Parthenon on the Athenian
Acropolis, a colossal chryselephantine statue, that is, a frame work of
wood, covered with ivory and gold (Pausanias, i. 24). The figure of Victory stood on the hand of the goddess, as we frequently see in coins.
See. i. 6, 23, and the note in Schweig.'s edition. <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>, de Natura

attitude for ever. But the works of God have power of
motion, they breathe, they have the faculty of using the
appearances of things, and the power of examining them.
Being the work of such an artist do you dishonour him?
And what shall I say, not only that he made you, but also
entrusted you to yourself and made you a deposit to your-
self? Will you not think of this too, but do you also dis-
honour your guardianship? But if God had entrusted
an orphan to you, would you thus neglect him? He has
delivered yourself to your own care, and says, I had no
one fitter to intrust him to than yourself: keep him for
me such as he is by nature, modest, faithful, erect, unterri-
fled, free from passion and perturbation. And then you
do not keep him such.

<head>That when we cannot fulfil that which the character of a man promises, we assume the character of a philosopher.</head>
<p>It is no common (easy) thing to do this only, to fulfil the
promise of a man's nature. For what is a man? The
answer is, a rational and mortal being. Then by the
rational faculty from whom are we separated?<note anchored="yes">'The abuse of the faculties, which are proper to man, called ration-
ality and liberty, is the origin of evil. By rationality is meant the
faculty of understanding truths and thence falses, and goods and then
evils; and by liberty is meant the faculty of thinking, willing and
acting freely&mdash;and these faculties distinguish man from beasts.'
Swedenborg, Angelic Wisdom, 264 and also 240. See Epictetus, ii. c. 8</note> From
wild beasts. And from what others? From sheep and
like animals. Take care then to do nothing like a wild
beast; but if you do, you have lost the character of
a man; you have not fulfilled your promise. See that
you do nothing like a sheep; but if you do, in this case
also the man is lost. What then do we do as sheep?
When we act gluttonously, when we act lewdly, when we
act rashly, filthily, inconsiderately, to what have we
declined? To sheep. What have we lost? The rational
faculty. When we act contentiously and harmfully and
passionately, and violently, to what have we declined?
To wild beasts. Consequently some of us are great wild
beasts, and others little beasts, of a bad disposition and
<pb n="124"/>
small, whence we may say, Let me be eaten by a lion.<note anchored="yes">This seems to be a proverb. If I am eaten, let me be eaten by the
nobler animal.</note>
But in all these ways the promise of a man acting as a
man is destroyed. For when is a conjunctive (complex)
proposition maintained?<note anchored="yes">A conjunctive or complex (<foreign lang="greek">sumpeplegme/non</foreign>) axiom or lemma.
Gellius (<bibl n="Gel. 16.8">xvi. 8</bibl>) gives an example: 'P. Scipio, the son of Paulus, was
both twice consul and triumphed, and exercised the censorship and was
the colleague of L. Mummius in his censorship.' Gellius adds, 'in
every conjunctive if there is one falsehood, though the other parts are
true, the whole is said to be false,' For the whole is proposed as true:
therefore if one part is false, the whole is not true. The disjunctive
(<foreign lang="greek">diezeugme/non</foreign>) is of this kind: 'pleasure is either bad or good, or
neither good nor bad.'</note> When it fulfils what its nature
promises; so that the preservation of a complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of truths. When is a
disjunctive maintained? When it fulfils what it promises.
When are flutes, a lyre, a horse, a dog, preserved? (when
they severally keep their promise). What is the wonder
then if man also in like manner is preserved, and in like
manner is lost? Each man is improved and preserved by
corresponding acts, the carpenter by acts of carpentry,
the grammarian by acts of grammar. But if a man
accustoms himself to write ungrammatically, of necessity
his art will be corrupted and destroyed. Thus modest
actions preserve the modest man, and immodest actions
destroy him: and actions of fidelity preserve the faithful
man, and the contrary actions destroy him. And on the
other hand contrary actions strengthen contrary characters: shamelessness strengthens the shameless man,
faithlessness the faithless man, abusive words the abusive
man, anger the man of an angry temper, and unequal
receiving and giving make the avaricious man more
avaricious.</p>
<p>For this reason philosophers admonish us not to be
satisfied with learning only, but also to add study, and
then practice.<note anchored="yes">We often say a man learns a particular thing: and there are men
who profess to teach certain things, such as a language, or an art; and
they mean by teaching that the taught shall learn; and learning means
that they shall be able to do what they learn. He who teaches an art
professes that the scholar shall be able to practise the art, the art of making shoes for example, or other useful things. There are men who
profess to teach religion, and morality, and virtue generally. These
men may tell us what they conceive to be religion, and morality, and
virtue; and those who are said to be taught may know what their
teachers have told them. But the learning of religion, and of morality
and of virtue, mean that the learner will do the acts of religion and of
morality and of virtue; which is a very different thing from knowing
what the acts of religion, of morality, and of virtue are. The teacher's
teaching is in fact only made efficient by his example, by his doing that
which he teaches</note> For we have long been accustomed to do
<pb n="125"/>
contrary things, and we put in practice opinions which
are contrary to true opinions. If then we shall not also
put in practice right opinions, we shall be nothing more
than the expositors of the opinions of others. For now
who among us is not able to discourse according to the
rules of art about good and evil things (in this fashion)?
That of things some are good, and some are bad, and some
are indifferent: the good then are virtues, and the things
which participate in virtues; and the bad are the contrary; and the indifferent are wealth, health, reputation.&mdash;
Then, if in the midst of our talk there should happen some
greater noise than usual, or some of those who are present
should laugh at us, we are disturbed. Philosopher, where
are the things which you were talking about? Whence
did you produce and utter them. From the lips, and
thence only. Why then do you corrupt the aids provided
by others? Why do you treat the weightiest matters as if
you were playing a game of dice? For it is one thing
to lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse, and another
thing to eat. That which has been eaten, is digested,
distributed, and is become sinews, flesh, bones, blood,
healthy colour, healthy breath. Whatever is stored up,
when you choose you can readily take and show it; but
you have no other advantage from it except so far as to
appear to possess it. For what is the difference between
explaining these doctrines and those of men who have
different opinions? Sit down now and explain according
to the rules of art the opinions of Epicurus, and perhaps
you will explain his opinions in a more useful manner
than Epicurus himself.<note anchored="yes">'He is not a Stoic philosopher, who can only explain in a subtle
and proper manner the Stoic principles: for the same person can
explain the principles of Epicurus, of course for the purpose of refuting them, and perhaps he can explain them better than Epicurus himself.
Consequently he might be at the same time a Stoic and an Epicurean;
which is absurd.'&mdash;Schweig. He means that the mere knowledge
of Stoic opinions does not make a man a Stoic, or any other
philosopher. A man must according to Stoic principles practise them
in order to be a Stoic philosopher. So if we say that a man is a
religious man, he must do the acts which his religion teaches; for it is
by his acts only that we can know him to be a religious man. What
he says and professes may be false; and no man knows except himself
whether his words and professions are true. The uniformity, regularity,
and consistency of his acts are evidence which cannot be mistaken.</note> Why then do you call yourself a

the part of a Jew,<note anchored="yes">It has been suggested that Epictetus confounded under the name
of Jews those who were Jews and those who were <placeName key="tgn,2238725">Christians</placeName>. We
know that some Jews became <placeName key="tgn,2238725">Christians</placeName>. But see Schweig.'s note 1
and note 7.</note> when you are a Greek? Do you not
see how (why) each is called a Jew, or a Syrian or an
Egyptian? and when we see a man inclining to two sides,
we are accustomed to say, This man is not a Jew, but he
acts as one. But when he has assumed the affects of one
who has been imbued with Jewish doctrine and has
adopted that sect, then he is in fact and he is named a
Jew.<note anchored="yes">It is possible, as I have said, that by Jews Epictetus means
<placeName key="tgn,2238725">Christians</placeName>, for <placeName key="tgn,2238725">Christians</placeName> and Jews are evidently confounded by some
writers, as the first <placeName key="tgn,2238725">Christians</placeName> were of the Jewish nation. In book iv.
c. 7, Epictetus gives the name of Galilaeans to the Jews. The term
Galilaeans points to the country of the great teacher. Paul says
(Romans, ii. 28), 'For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly&mdash;but he
is a Jew which is one inwardly,' etc. His remarks (ii. 17&ndash;29) on the
man 'who is called a Jew, and rests in the law and makes his boast
of God' may be compared with what Epictetus says of a man who is
called a philosopher, and does not practise that which he professes.</note> Thus we too being falsely imbued (baptized), are
in name Jews, but in fact we are something else. Our
affects (feelings) are inconsistent with our words; we are
far from practising what we say, and that of which we are
proud, as if we knew it. Thus being unable to fulfil even
what the character of a man promises, we even add to it
the profession of a philosopher, which is as heavy a burden,
as if a man who is unable to bear ten pounds should
attempt to raise the stone which Ajax<note anchored="yes">See ii. 24, 26; <placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName>, vii. 264, etc.; <cit><bibl n="Juv. 15.65">Juvenal, xv. 65,</bibl>

even to assent to it. If a man believes that all is wisely arranged in
the course of human events, he would not even try to resist that which
he knows it is appointed for him to suffer: he would submit and he
would endure. If Epictetus means that the man would actively pro&mdash;
mote the end or purpose which he foreknew, in order that his acts may
be consistent with what he foreknows and with his duty, perhaps the
philosopher's saying is too hard to deal with; and as it rests on an
impossible assumption of foreknowledge, we may be here wiser than
the philosophers, if we say no more about it. Compare <placeName key="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName>, de
Provid. c. 5.</note> that these
things are assigned to him according to the universal
<pb n="128"/>
arrangement, and that the whole is superior to the part,
and the state to the citizen.<note anchored="yes">Antoninus, vi. 42: 'We are all working together to one end, some
with knowledge and design, and others without knowing what
they do.'</note> But now because we do not
know the future, it is our duty to stick to the things
which are in their nature more suitable for our choice, for
we were made among other things for this.</p>
<p>After this remember that you are a son. What does
this character promise? To consider that every thing
which is the son's belongs to the father, to obey him in
all things, never to blame him to another, nor to say or
do any thing which does him injury, to yield to him in all
things and give way, co-operating with him as far as you
can. After this know that you are a brother also, and
that to this character it is due to make concessions; to be
easily persuaded, to speak good of your brother, never to
claim in opposition to him any of the things which are
independent of the will, but readily to give them up, that
you may have the larger share in what is dependent on
the will. For see what a thing it is, in place of a lettuce,
if it should so happen, or a seat, to gain for yourself
goodness of disposition. How great is the advantage.<note anchored="yes">A lettuce is an example of the most trifling thing. A seat
probably means a seat of superiority, a magistrate's seat, a Roman
sella curulis.</note></p>
<p>Next to this, if you are a senator of any state, remember
that you are a senator: if a youth, that you are a youth:
if an old man, that you are an old man; for each of such
names, if it comes to be examined, marks out the proper
duties. But if you go and blame your brother, I say to
you, You have forgotten who you are and what is your
name. In the next place, if you were a smith and made
a wrong use of the hammer, you would have forgotten the
smith; and if you have forgotten the brother and instead
of a brother have become an enemy, would you appear not
to have changed one thing for another in that case? And
if instead of a man, who is a tame animal and social, you
are become a mischievous wild beast, treacherous, and
biting, have you lost nothing? But, (I suppose) you must
lose a bit of money that you may suffer damage? And
does the loss of nothing else do a man damage? If you
<pb n="129"/>
had lost the art of grammar or music, would you think
the loss of it a damage? and if you shall lose modesty,
moderation (<foreign lang="greek">katastolh/n</foreign>) and gentleness, do you think the
loss nothing? And yet the things first mentioned are lost
by some cause external and independent of the will, and
the second by our own fault; and as to the first neither to
have them nor to lose them is shameful; but as to the
second, not to have them and to lose them is shameful and
matter of reproach and a misfortune. What does the
pathic lose? He loses the (character of) man. What
does he lose who makes the pathic what he is? Many
other things; and he also loses the man no less than the
other. What does he lose who commits adultery? He
loses the (character of the) modest, the temperate, the
decent, the citizen, the neighbour. What does he lose who
is angry? Something else. What does the coward lose?
Something else. No man is bad without suffering some
loss and damage. If then you look for the damage in
the loss of money only, all these men receive no harm
or damage; it may be, they have even profit and gain,
when they acquire a bit of money by any of these deeds.
But consider that if you refer every thing to a small coin,
not even he who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged.
Yes, you say, for he is mutilated in his body. Well; but
does he who has lost his smell only lose nothing? Is there
then no energy of the soul which is an advantage to him
who possesses it, and a damage to him who has lost it?&mdash;
Tell me what sort (of energy) you mean.&mdash;Have we not a
natural modesty?&mdash;We have.&mdash;Does he who loses this
sustain no damage? is he deprived of nothing, does he part
with nothing of the things which belong to him? Have
we not naturally fidelity? natural affection, a natural disposition to help others, a natural disposition to forbearance?
The man then who allows himself to be damaged in these
matters, can he be free from harm and uninjured<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos h)=| a)blabh/s</foreign>. See Schweig.'s note.</note> What
then? shall I not hurt him, who has hurt me?<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>. We must by no means then do an act of injustice. Crito.
Certainly not. <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>. Nor yet when you are wronged must you do
wrong in return, as most people think, since you must in no way do an
unjust act. Plato, Crito, c. 10.</note> In the
<pb n="130"/>
first place consider what hurt (<foreign lang="greek">bla/bh</foreign>) is, and remember
what you have heard from the philosophers. For if the
good consists in the will (purpose, intention, <foreign lang="greek">proaire/sei</foreign>),
and the evil also in the will,<note anchored="yes">See the beginning of ii. 16.</note> see if what you say is
not this: What then, since that man has hurt himself
by doing an unjust act to me, shall I not hurt myself
by doing some unjust act to him? Why do we not
imagine to ourselves (mentally think of) something of
this kind? But where there is any detriment to the body
or to our possession, there is harm there; and where the
same thing happens to the faculty of the will, there is
(you suppose) no harm; for he who has been deceived or
he who has done an unjust act neither suffers in the head
nor in the eye nor in the hip, nor does he lose his estate;
and we wish for nothing else than (security to) these
things. But whether we shall have the will modest and
faithful or shameless and faithless, we care not the least,
except only in the school so far as a few words are con-
cerned. Therefore our proficiency is limited to these few
words; but beyond them it does not exist even in the
slightest degree.<note anchored="yes">The same remark will apply to most dissertations spoken or written
on moral subjects: they are exercises of skill for him who delivers or
writes them, or matter for criticism and perhaps a way of spending an
idle hour for him who listens; and that is all. Epictetus blames our
indolence and indifference as to acts, and the trifling of the schools of
philosophy in disputation.</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<head>What the beginning of philosophy is.</head>
<p>THE beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters
on it in the right way and by the door, is a consciousness
of his own weakness and inability about necessary things.
For we come into the world with no natural notion of a
right angled triangle, or of a diesis (a quarter tone), or of
a half tone; but we learn each of these things by a cer-
tain transmission according to art; and for this reason
<pb n="131"/>
those who do not know them, do not think that they know
them. But as to good and evil, and beautiful and ugly,
and becoming and unbecoming, and happiness and misfortune, and proper and improper, and what we ought to
do and what we ought not to do, who ever came into the
world without having an innate idea of them? Wherefore we all use these names, and we endeavour to fit the
preconceptions<note anchored="yes">See i. e. 2.</note> to the several cases (things) thus: he has
done well, he has not done well; he has done as he ought,
not as he ought; he has been unfortunate, he has been
fortunate; he is unjust, he is just: who does not use
these names? who among us defers the use of them till he
has learned them, as he defers the use of the words about
lines (geometrical figures) or sounds? And the cause of
this is that we come into the world already taught as it
were by nature some things on this matter (<foreign lang="greek">to/pon</foreign>), and
proceeding from these we have added to them self&mdash;conceit
(<foreign lang="greek">oi)/hsin</foreign>).<note anchored="yes">See <placeName key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>'s use of 'opinatio' (Tusc. iv. 11).</note> For why, a man says, do I not know the beautiful and the ugly? Have I not the notion of it? You
have. Do I not adapt it to particulars? You do. Do I
not then adapt it properly? In that lies the whole question; and conceit is added here. For beginning from
these things which are admitted men proceed to that
which is matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation; for if they possessed this power of adaptation in
addition to those things, what would hinder them from
being perfect? But now since you think that you properly adapt the preconceptions to the particulars, tell me
whence you derive this (assume that you do so). Because
I think so. But it does not seem so to another, and he
thinks that he also makes a proper adaptation; or does he
not think so? He does think so. Is it possible then that
both of you can properly apply the preconceptions to
things about which you have contrary opinions? It is
not possible. Can you then show us anything better
towards adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking
that you do? Does the madman do any other things than
the things which seem to him right? Is then this
criterion sufficient for him also? It is not sufficient.
<pb n="132"/>
Come then to something which is superior to seeming
(<foreign lang="greek">tou= dokei=n</foreign>). What is this?</p>
<p>Observe, this is the beginning of philosophy, a perception of the disagreement of men with one another, and
an inquiry into the cause of the disagreement, and a
condemnation and distrust of that which only 'seems,'
and a certain investigation of that which 'seems' whether
it 'seems' rightly, and a discovery of some rule (<foreign lang="greek">kano/nos</foreign>),
as we have discovered a balance in the determination of
weights, and a carpenter's rule (or square) in the case of
straight and crooked things.&mdash;This is the beginning of
philosophy. Must we say that all things are right which
seem so to all?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> And how is it possible that contradictions
can be right?&mdash;Not all then, but all which seem to us to be
right.&mdash;How more to you than those which seem right to the
Syrians? why more than what seem right to the Egyptians?
why more than what seems right to me or to any other man?
Not at all more. What then 'seems' to every man is not
sufficient for determining what 'is;' for neither in the case
of weights or measures are we satisfied with the bare appearance, but in each case we have discovered a certain
rule. In this matter then is there no rule superior to
what 'seems'? And how is it possible that the most
necessary things among men should have no sign (mark),
and be incapable of being discovered? There is then
some rule. And why then do we not seek the rule and
discover it, and afterwards use it without varying from it,
not even stretching out the finger without it?<note anchored="yes">Doing nothing without the rule. This is a Greek proverb, used
also by Persius, Sat. v. 119; compare <placeName key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>, de Fin. iii. 17; and
Antoninus, ii 16.</note> For this,
I think, is that which when it is discovered cures of their
madness those who use mere 'seeming' as a measure, and
misuse it; so that for the future proceeding from certain
things (principles) known and made clear we may use in
the case of particular things the preconceptions which are
distinctly fixed.</p>
<p>What is the matter presented to us about which we are
inquiring? Pleasure (for example). Subject it to the
rule, throw it into the balance. Ought the good to be
<pb n="133"/>
such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it?
Yes. And in which we ought to confide? It ought to
be. Is it fit to trust to any thing which is insecure?
No. Is then pleasure any thing secure? No. Take it
Then and throw it out of the scale, and drive it far away
from the place of good things. But if you are not sharp-
sighted, and one balance is not enough for you, bring
another. Is it fit to be elated over what is good? Yes.
Is it proper then to be elated over present pleasure? See
that you do not say that it is proper; but if you do, I
shall then not think you worthy even of the balance.<note anchored="yes">That is, so far shall I consider you from being able to judge rightly
of things without a balance that I shall understand that not even with
the aid of a balance can you do it, that you cannot even use a balance,
and consequently that you are not worth a single word from me.
Schweig.</note>
Thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are
ready. And to philosophize is this, to examine and confirm the rules; and then to use them when they are
known is the act of a wise and good man.<note anchored="yes">This is a just conclusion. We must fix the canons or rules by
which things are tried; and then the rules may be applied by the wise
and good to all cases.</note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Of disputation or discussion.</head>
<p>WHAT things a man must learn in order to be able to
apply the art of disputation, has been accurately shown by
our philosophers (the Stoics); but with respect to the
proper use of the things, we are entirely without practice.
Only give to any of us, whom you please, an illiterate man
to discuss with, and he can not discover how to deal with
the man. But when he has moved the man a little, if he
answers beside the purpose, he does not know how to treat
him, but he then either abuses or ridicules him, and says,
He is an illiterate man; it is not possible to do any thing
<pb n="134"/>
with him. Now a guide, when he has found a man out of
the road leads him into the right way: he does not ridi-
eule or abuse him and then leave him. Do you also show
the illiterate man the truth, and you will see that he fellows. But so long as you do not show him the truth, do
not ridicule him, but rather feel your own incapacity.</p>
<p>How then did <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> act? He used to compel his
adversary in disputation to bear testimony to him, and
he wanted no other witness.<note anchored="yes">This is what is said in the Gorgias of Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 474a">p. 472, 474</bibl>.</note> Therefore he could say, 'I
care not for other witnesses, but I am always satisfied
with the evidence (testimony) of my adversary, and I do
not ask the opinion of others, but only the opinion of him
who is disputing with me.' For he used to make the
conclusions drawn from natural notions<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">e)/nnoiai</foreign>, which <placeName key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName> explains to be the name as
<foreign lang="greek">prolh/yeis</foreign>. Acad. Pr. ii. 10.</note> so plain that
every man saw the contradiction (if it existed) and withdrew from it (thus):
Does the envious<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>' notion of envy is stated by Xenophon (<bibl n="Xen. Mem. 3.9.8">Mem. iii. 9, 8</bibl>), to
be this: 'it is the pain or vexation which men have at the prosperity of their friends, and that such are the only envious persons.'
Bishop Butler gives a better definition; at least a more complete description of the thing. 'Emulation is merely the desire and hope of
equality with or superiority over others, with whom we may compare
ourselves. There does not appear to be any <hi rend="ital">other grief</hi> in the natural
passion, but only <hi rend="ital">that want</hi> which is implied in desire. However this
may be so strong as to be the occasion of great <hi rend="ital">grief.</hi> To desire the
attainment of this equality or superiority, by the <hi rend="ital">particular means</hi> of
others being brought down to our level, or below it, is, I think, the
distinct notion of envy. From whence it is easy to see, that the real
end which the natural passion, emulation, and which the unlawful
one, envy, aims at is the same; namely, that equality or superiority:
and consequently that to do mischief is not the end of envy, but merely
the means it makes use of to attain its end.'&mdash;Sermons upon Human
Nature, I.</note> man rejoice? By
no means, but he is rather pained.<note anchored="yes">I have omitted the words <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tou= e)nanti/ou e)ki/nhse to\n plhsion</foreign> I
see no sense in them; and the text is plain without them.</note> Well, Do you think
that envy is pain over evils? and what envy is there of
evils? Therefore he made his adversary say that envy is
pain over good things. Well then, would any man envy
those who are nothing to him? By no means. Thus
having completed the notion and distinctly fixed it he
<pb n="135"/>
would go away without saying to his adversary, Define to
me envy; and if the adversary had defined envy, he did
not say, You have defined it badly, for the terms of the
definition do not correspond to the thing defined&mdash;These
are technical terms, and for this reason disagreeable and
hardly intelligible to illiterate men, which terms we
(philosophers) cannot lay aside. But that the illiterate
man himself, who follows the appearances presented to
him, should be able to concede any thing or reject it, we
can never by the use of these terms move him to do.<note anchored="yes">I am not sure that I have understood rightly it <foreign lang="greek">e)c w(=n de\ au)to/s</foreign> at the
beginning of this sentence.</note>
Accordingly being conscious of our own inability, we do
not attempt the thing; at least such of us as have any
caution do not. But the greater part and the rash, when
they enter into such disputations, confuse themselves and
confuse others; and finally abusing their adversaries and
abused by them, they walk away.
Now this was the first and chief peculiarity of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>,
never to be irritated in argument, never to utter any thing
abusive, any thing insulting, but to bear with abusive
persons and to put an end to the quarrel. If you would
know what great power he had in this way, read the
Symposium of Xenophon,<note anchored="yes">The Symposium or Banquet of Xenophon is extant. Compare
Epietetus, iii. 16, 5, and iv. o. 5, the beginning.</note> and you will see how many
quarrels he put an end to. Hence with good reason in the
poets also this power is most highly praised,
<quote rend="blockquote">Quickly with skill he settles great disputes.
<p>Hesiod, Theogony, v. 87.</p></quote>
Well then; the matter is not now very safe, and particularly at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; for he who attempts to do it, must not do
it in a corner, you may be sure, but must go to a man of
consular rank, if it so happen, or to a rich man, and ask
him, Can you tell me, Sir, to whose care you have entrusted your horses? I can tell you. Have you entrusted
them to any person indifferently and to one who has no
experience of horses?&mdash;By no means.&mdash;Well then; can
you tell me to whom you entrust your gold or silver
things or your vestments? I don't entrust even these to
<pb n="136"/>
any one indifferently. Well; your own body, have you
already considered about entrusting the care of it to any
person?&mdash;Certainly.&mdash;To a man of experience, I suppose,
and one acquainted with the aliptic,<note anchored="yes">The aliptic art is the art of anointing and rubbing, one of the best
means of maintaining a body in health. The iatric or healing art is the
art of restoring to health a diseased body. The aliptic art is also
equivalent to the gymnastic art, or the art of preparing for gymnastic
exercises, which are also a means of preserving the body's health, when
the exercises are good and moderate.</note> or with the healing
art?&mdash;Without doubt.&mdash;Are these the best things that you
have, or do you also possess something else which is better
than all these?&mdash;What kind of a thing do you mean?&mdash;
That I mean which makes use of these things, and tests
each of them, and deliberates.&mdash;Is it the soul that you
mean?&mdash;You think right, for it is the soul that I mean.&mdash;
In truth I do think that the soul is a much better thing
than all the others which I possess.&mdash;Can you then show
us in what way you have taken care of the soul? for it is
not likely that you, who are so wise a man and have a
reputation in the city, inconsiderately and carelessly allow
the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected
and to perish.&mdash;Certainly not.&mdash;But have you taken care
of the soul yourself; and have you learned from another
to do this, or have you discovered the means yourself?&mdash;
Here comes the danger that in the first place he may say,
What is this to you, my good man, who are you? Next, if
you persist in troubling him, there is danger that he may
raise his hands and give you blows. I was once myself
also an admirer of this mode of instruction until I fell into

<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<head>On anxiety (solicitude).</head>
<p>WHEN I see a man anxious, I say, What does this man
want? If he did not want some thing which is not in his
power, how could he be anxious? For this reason a lute
<pb n="137"/>
player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety, but
when he enters the theatre, he is anxious even if he has a
good voice and plays well on the lute; for he not only
wishes to sing well, but also to obtain applause: but this
is not in his power. Accordingly, where he has skill,
there he has confidence. Bring any single person who
knows nothing of music, and the musician does not care
for him. But in the matter where a man knows nothing
and has not been practised, there he is anxious. What
matter is this? He knows not what a crowd is or what
the praise of a crowd is. However he has learned to
strike the lowest chord and the highest;<note anchored="yes">See i. 29, note 20.</note> but what the
praise of the many is, and what power it has in life he
neither knows nor has he thought about it. Hence he
must of necessity tremble and grow pale. I cannot then
say that a man is not a lute player when I see him
afraid, but I can say something else, and not one thing,
but many. And first of all I call him a stranger and say,
This man does not know in what part of the world he is,
but though he has been here so long, he is ignorant of
the laws of the State and the customs, and what is permitted and what is not; and he has never employed any
lawyer to tell him and to explain the laws. But a man
does not write a will, if he does not know how it ought to
be written, or he employs a person who does know; nor
does he rashly seal a bond or write a security. But he
uses his desire without a lawyer's advice, and aversion,
and pursuit (movement), and attempt and purpose. How
do you mean without a lawyer? He does not know that
he wills what is not allowed, and does not will that which
is of necessity; and he does not know either what is his
own or what is another man's; but if he did know, he
would never be impeded, he would never be hindered, he
would not be anxious. How so?&mdash;Is any man then afraid
about things which are not evils?&mdash;No.&mdash;Is he afraid
about things which are evils, but still so far within his
power that they may not happen?&mdash;Certainly he is not.&mdash;
If then the things which are independent of the will are
neither good nor bad, and all things which do depend on
<pb n="138"/>
the will are within our power, and no man can either take
them from us or give them to us, if we do not choose,
where is room left for anxiety? But we are anxious about
our poor body, our little property, about the will of Caesar;
but not anxious about things internal. Are we anxious
about not forming a false opinion?&mdash;No, for this is in my
power.&mdash;About not exerting our movements contrary to
nature?&mdash;No, not even about this.&mdash;When then you
see a man pale, as the physician says, judging from the
complexion, this man's spleen is disordered, that man's
liver; so also say, this man's desire and aversion are disordered, he is not in the right way, he is in a fever. For
nothing else changes the colour, or causes trembling or
chattering of the teeth, or causes a man to

he was not anxious, for Antigonus had no power over any
of the things which <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> admired; and Zeno did not care
for those things over which Antigonus had power. But
Antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet Zeno,
for he wished to please Zeno; but this was a thing
external (out of his power). But Zeno did not want to
please Antigonus; for no man who is skilled in any art
wishes to please one who has no such skill.</p>
<p>Should I try to please you? Why? I suppose, you
know the measure by which one man is estimated by
another. Have you taken pains to learn what is a good
man and what is a bad man, and how a man becomes one
or the other? Why then are you not good yourself?
&mdash;How, he replies, am I not good?&mdash;Because no good man
laments or groans or weeps, no good man is pale and
trembles, or says, How will he receive me, how will he
listen to me?&mdash;Slave, just as it pleases him. Why do you
care about what belongs to others? Is it now his fault if
he receives badly what proceeds from you?&mdash;Certainly.&mdash;
<pb n="139"/>
And is it possible that a fault should be one man's, and
the evil in another?&mdash;No.&mdash;Why then are you anxious
about that which belongs to others?&mdash;Your question is
reasonable; but I am anxious how I shall speak to him.
Cannot you then speak to him as you choose?&mdash;But I fear
that I may be disconcerted?&mdash;If you are going to write the

the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and

Yes.&mdash;When then you are mounted on a horse and go into

<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<head>To Naso.</head>
<p>WHEN a certain Roman entered with his son and listened
to one reading, Epictetus said, This is the method of instruction; and he stopped. When the Roman asked him
to go on, Epictetus said, Every art when it is taught
causes labour to him who is unacquainted with it and
is unskilled in it, and indeed the things which proceed
from the arts immediately show their use in the purpose
for which they were made; and most of them contain something attractive and pleasing. For indeed to be present
and to observe how a shoemaker learns is not a pleasant
thing; but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to
look at. And the discipline of a smith when he is learning
is very disagreeable to one who chances to be present and
is a stranger to the art: but the work shows the use of
the art. But you will see this much more in music; for
if you are present while a person is learning, the discipline will appear most disagreeable; and yet the results
of music are pleasing and delightful to those who know
nothing of music. And here we conceive the work of a
philosopher to be something of this kind: he must adapt
his wish (<foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsin</foreign>) to what is going on,<note anchored="yes">Encheiridion, c. 8: 'Do not seek (wish) that things which take
place shall take place as you desire, but desire that things which take
place shall take place as they do, and you will live a tranquil life.'</note> so that neither
any of the things which are taking place shall take place
contrary to our wish, nor any of the things which do not
take place shall not take place when we wish that they
<pb n="141"/>
should. From this the result is to those who have so
arranged the work of philosophy, not to fail in the desire,
nor to fall in with that which they would avoid; without
uneasiness, without fear, without perturbation to pass
through life themselves, together with their associates
maintaining the relations both natural and acquired,<note anchored="yes">Compare iii. 2. 4, iv. 8. 20. Antoninus (viii. 27) writes: 'There are
three relations [between thee and other things]: the one to the body
which surrounds thee; the second to the divine cause from which all
things come to all; and the third to those who live with thee.' This
is precise, true and practical. Those who object to 'the divine cause,'
may write in place of it 'the nature and constitution of things;' for
there is a constitution of things, which the philosopher attempts to.
discover; and for most practical purposes, it is immaterial whether we
say that it is of divine origin or has some other origin, or no origin can
be discovered. The fact remains that a constitution of things exists;
or, if that expression be not accepted, we may say that we conceive that
it exists and we cannot help thinking so.</note> as
the relation of son, of father, of brother, of citizen, of man,
of wife, of neighbour, of fellow traveller, of ruler, of ruled.
The work of a philosopher we conceive to be something
like this. It remains next to inquire how this must be
accomplished.</p>
<p>We see then that the carpenter (<foreign lang="greek">te/ktwn</foreign>) when he has
learned certain things becomes a carpenter; the pilot by
learning certain things becomes a pilot. May it not then in
philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good,
and that there is also a necessity to learn certain things?
We inquire then what these things are. The philosophers
say that we ought first to learn that there is a God and
that he provides for all things; also that it is not possible
to conceal from him our acts, or even our intentions and
thoughts.<note anchored="yes">See i. 14. 13, ii. 8. 14. <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> (<bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.1.19">Xen. Mem. i. 1. 19</bibl>) said the
same. That man should make himself like the Gods is said also by
Antoninus, x. 8.&mdash;See Plato, De Legg. i. 4. (<placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>.)
<p>When God is said to provide for all things, this is what the Greeks
called <foreign lang="greek">pro/noia</foreign>, providence. (Epictetus, i. 16, iii. 17.) In the second of
these passages there is a short answer to some objections made to
Providence.</p>
<p>Epictetus could only know or believe what God is by the observation
of phaenomena; and he could only know what he supposed to be God's
providence by observing his administration of the world and all that
happens in it. Among other works of God is man, who possesses certain intellectual powers which enable him to form a judgment of
God's works, and a judgment of man himself. Man has or is supposed
to have certain moral sentiments, or a capacity of acquiring them in
some way. On the supposition that all man's powers are the gift of
God, man's power of judging what happens in the world under God's
providence is the gift of God: and if he should not be satisfied with
God's administration, we have the conclusion that man, whose powers
are from God, condemns that administration which is also from God.
Thus God and man, who is God's work, are in opposition to one
another.</p>
<p>If a man rejects the belief in a deity and in a providence, because
of the contradictions and difficulties involved in this belief or supposed
to be involved in it, and if he finds the contradictions and difficulties
such as he cannot reconcile with his moral sentiments and judgments,
he will be consistent in rejecting the notion of a deity and of providence. But he must also consistently admit that his moral sentiments
and judgments are his own, and that he cannot say how he acquired
them, or how he has any of the corporeal or intellectual powers which
he is daily using. By the hypothesis they are not from God. All
then that a man can say is that he has such powers.</p></note> The next thing is to learn what is the nature
<pb n="142"/>
of the Gods; for such as they are discovered to be, he, who
would please and obey them, must try with all his power
to be like them. If the divine is faithful, man also must
be faithful; if it is free, man also must be free; if beneficent, man also must be beneficent; if magnanimous, mall
also must be magnanimous; as being then an imitator of
God he must do and say every thing consistently with this
fact.</p>
<p>With what then must we begin? If you will enter on
the discussion, I will tell you that you must first under-
stand names<note anchored="yes">See ii. 10, i. 17. 12, ii. 11. 4, etc. M. Antoninus, x. 8.</note> (words).&mdash;So then you say that I do not
now understand names.&mdash;You do not understand them.&mdash;
How then do I use them?&mdash;Just as the illiterate use
written language, as cattle use appearances: for use is
one thing, understanding is another. But if you think
that you understand them, produce whatever word you
please, and let us try whether we understand it.&mdash;But it
is a disagreeable thing for a man to be confuted who is
now old, and, it may be, has now served his three campaigns.&mdash;I too know this: for now you are come to me as
if you were in want of nothing: and what could you even
imagine to be wanting to you? You are rich, you have
children and a wife perhaps, and many slaves: Caesar
<pb n="143"/>
knows you, in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> you have many friends, you render
their dues to all, you know how to requite him who does
you a favour, and to repay in the same kind him who
does you a wrong. What do you lack? If then I shall shew
you that you lack the things most necessary and the chief
things for happiness, and that hitherto you have looked
after every thing rather than what you ought, and, to crown
all,<note anchored="yes">The original is 'to add the colophon,' which is a proverbial express-
sion and signifies to give the last touch to a thing.</note> that you neither know what God is nor what man is,
nor what is good nor what is bad; and as to what I have said
about your ignorance of other matters, that may perhaps be
endured, but if I say that you know nothing about yourself,
how is it possible that you should endure me and bear the
proof and stay here? It is not possible; but you immediately go off in bad humour. And yet what harm have
I done you? unless the mirror also injures the ugly man
because it shows him to himself such as he is; unless the
physician also is supposed to insult the sick man, when he
says to him, Man, do you think that you ail nothing?
But you have a fever: go without food to&mdash;day; drink
water. And no one says, what an insult! But if you
say to a man, Your desires are inflamed, your aversions
are low, your intentions are inconsistent, your pursuits
(movements) are not conformable to nature, your opinions
are rash and false, the man immediately goes away and
says, He has insulted me.</p>
<p>Our way of dealing is like that of a crowded assembly.<note anchored="yes">See the fragments of Menander quoted by <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>.</note>
Beasts are brought to be sold and oxen; and the greater
part of the men come to buy and sell, and there are some
few who come to look at the market and to inquire how
it is carried on, and why, and who fixes the meeting
and for what purpose. So it is here also in this assembly (of life): some like cattle trouble themselves about
nothing except their fodder. For to all of you who are
busy about possessions and lands and slaves and magisterial offices, these are nothing except fodder. But there
are a few who attend the assembly, men who love to
look on and consider what is the world, who governs it.

There is then an administrator. What kind of administrator and how does he govern? And who are we, who
were produced by him, and for what purpose? Have we
some connexion with him and some relation towards him,
or none? This is the way in which these few are affected,
and then they apply themselves only to this one thing, to
examine the meeting and then to go away. What then?
They are ridiculed by the many, as the spectators at the

<head>To or against those who obstinately persist in what they have determined.</head>
<p>WHEN some persons have heard these words, that a man
ought to be constant (firm), and that [the will is naturally
free and not subject to compulsion, but that all other
things are subject to hindrance, to slavery, and are in the
power of others, they suppose that they ought without
deviation to abide by every thing which they have determined. But in the first place that which has been determined ought to be sound (true). I require tone (sinews)
in the body, but such as exists in a healthy body, in an
athletic body; but if it is plain to me that you have the
<pb n="145"/>
tone of a phrensied man and you boast of it, I shall say to
you, man, seek the physician: this is not tone, but atony
(deficiency in right tone). In a different way something
of the same kind is felt by those who listen to these discourses in a wrong manner; which was the case with one
of my companions who for no reason resolved to starve
himself to death.<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">a)pokarterei=n</foreign>, which <placeName key="tgn,2239741">Cicero</placeName> (Tusc. i. 34) renders 'per-

determined to end his great sufferings by starvation made the same

day of his abstinence from food and I went to inquire what
had happened. I have resolved, he said.&mdash;But still tell me
what it was which induced you to resolve; for if you have
resolved rightly, we shall sit with you and assist you to
depart; but if you have made an unreasonable resolution,
change your mind.&mdash;We ought to keep to our determinations.
&mdash;What are you doing, man? We ought to keep not to all
our determinations, but to those which are right; for if
you are now persuaded that it is night, do not change your
mind, if you think fit, but persist and say, we ought to
abide by our determinations. Will you not make the
beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether
the determination is sound or not sound, and so then build
on it firmness and security? But if you lay a rotten and
ruinous foundation, will not your miserable little building
fall down the sooner, the more and the stronger are the
materials which you shall lay on it? Without any reason
would you withdraw from us out of life a man who is a

the great and the small city?<note anchored="yes">The great city is the world.</note> Then while you are committing murder and destroying a man who has done no
wrong, do you say that you ought to abide by your determinations? And if it ever in any way came into your
head to kill me, ought you to abide by your determinations?</p>
<p>Now this man was with difficulty persuaded to change
his mind. But it is impossible to convince some persons
at present; so that I seem now to know, what I did not
know before, the meaning of the common saying, That
<pb n="146"/>

also: I know not what I ought to do, but I am come to
learn.&mdash;Not so; but speak to me about other things: upon
this I have determined.&mdash;What other things? for what is
greater and more useful than for you to be persuaded that
it is not sufficient to have made your determination and
not to change it. This is the tone (energy) of madness,
not of health.&mdash;I will die, if you compel me to this.&mdash;Why,
man? What has happened?&mdash;I have determined&mdash;I have
had a lucky escape that you have not determined to kill
me&mdash;I take no money.<note anchored="yes">' Epictetus seems in this discussion to be referring to some professor, who had declared that he would not take money from his

assured that with the very tone (energy) which you now
use in refusing to take, there is nothing to hinder you at
some time from inclining without reason to take money and
then saying, I have determined. As in a distempered
body, subject to defluxions, the humour inclines sometimes
to these parts, and then to those, so too a sickly soul knows
not which way to incline: but if to this inclination and
movement there is added a tone (obstinate resolution),
then the evil becomes past help and cure.

Why do you wonder then if in the cases which you have

rhetorician knows that he has written well, that he has
committed to memory what he has written, and brings an
agreeable voice, why is he still anxious? Because he is
not satisfied with having studied. What then does he
want? To be praised by the audience? For the purpose
then of being able to practise declamation he has been
disciplined; but with respect to praise and blame he has
not been disciplined. For when did he hear from any one
what praise is, what blame is, what the nature of each is,
what kind of praise should be sought, or what kind of
blame should be shunned? And when did he practise this
discipline which follows these words (things)?<note anchored="yes">That is which follows praise or blame. He seems to mean making
the proper use of praise or of blame.</note> Why
then do you still wonder, if in the matters which a man
has learned, there he surpasses others, and in those in

which he has not been disciplined, there he is the same
with the many. So the lute player knows how to play,
sings well, and has a fine dress, and yet he trembles when
he enters on the stage; for these matters he understands,
but he does not know what a crowd is, nor the shouts of a
crowd, nor what ridicule is. Neither does he know what
anxiety is, whether it is our work or the work of another,
whether it is possible to stop it or not. For this reason if
he has been praised, he leaves the theatre puffed up, but if
he has been ridiculed, the swollen bladder has been punctured and subsides.</p>
<p>This is the case also with ourselves. What do we
admire? Externals. About what things are we busy?
Externals. And have we any doubt then why we fear or
why we are anxious? What then happens when we think
the things, which are coming on us, to be evils? It is not
in our power not to be afraid, it is not in our power not to
be anxious. Then we say, Lord God, how shall I not be
anxious? Fool, have you not hands, did not God make
them for you? Sit down now and pray that your nose may

Has he not given to you endurance? has he not given to

When you have such hands, do you still look for one who
shall wipe your nose? But we neither study these things
nor care for them. Give me a man who cares how he
shall do any thing, not for the obtaining of a thing, but
who cares about his own energy. What man, when he is
walking about, cares for his own energy? who, when he
is deliberating, cares about his own deliberation, and not
about obtaining that about which he deliberates? And
if he succeeds, he is elated and says, How well we have
deliberated; did I not tell you, brother, that it is impossible, when we have thought about any thing, that it
should not turn out thus? But if the thing should turn
out otherwise, the wretched man is humbled; he knows
not even what to say about what has taken place. Who

owns his endeavours met with little or no success among his scholars.
The Apostles speak a very different language in their epistles to the
first converts of Christianity: and the Acts of the Apostles, and all the
monuments of the primitive ages bear testimony to the reformation of
manners produced by the Gospel. This difference of success might
indeed justly be expected from the difference of the two systems.' Mrs.
Carter.&mdash;I have not quoted this note of Mrs. Carter, because I think
that it is true. We do not know what was the effect of the teaching of
Epictetus, unless this passage informs us, if Mrs. Carter has drawn a
right inference from it. The language of Paul to the Corinthians is not
very different from that of Epictetus, and he speaks very unfavourably
of some of his Corinthian converts. We may allow that <quote>a reformation
of manners was produced by the Gospel</quote> in many of the converts to
Christianity, but there is no evidence that this reformation was produced in all; and there is evidence that it was not. The corruptions in
the early <placeName key="tgn,2000780">Christian</placeName> church and in subsequent ages are a proof that the
reforms made by the Gospel were neither universal nor permanent; and
this is the result which our knowledge of human nature would lead us
to expect.</note></p>
<p>Why then are we still surprised, if we are well practised in thinking about matters (any given subject), but
in our acts are low, without decency, worthless, cowardly,
impatient of labour, altogether bad? For we do not care
about these things nor do we study them. But if we had
feared not death or banishment, but fear itself,<note anchored="yes">See ii. 1. 13.</note> we should
have studied not to fall into those things which appear to
us evils. Now in the school we are irritable and wordy;
and if any little question arises about any of these things,
we are able to examine them fully. But drag us to practice, and you will find us miserably shipwrecked. Let
some disturbing appearance come on us, and you will
know what we have been studying and in what we have
been exercising ourselves. Consequently through want of
discipline we are always adding something to the appearance and representing things to be greater than what they
<pb n="150"/>
are. For instance as to myself, when I am on a voyage
and look down on the deep sea, or look round on it and
see no land, I am out of my mind and imagine that I must
drink up all this water if I am wrecked, and it does not
occur to me that three pints are enough. What then
disturbs me? The sea? No, but my opinion. Again,
when an earthquake shall happen, I imagine that the city
is going to fall on me; but is not one little stone enough
to knock my brains out?</p>
<p>What then are the things which are heavy on us and
disturb us? What else than opinions? What else then
opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away and leaves
his companions and friends and places and habits of life?
Now little children, for instance, when they cry on the
nurse leaving them for a short time, forget their sorrow if
they receive a small cake. Do you choose then that we
should compare you to little children?&mdash;No, by Zeus, for
I do not wish to be pacified by a small cake, but by right
opinions.&mdash;And what are these? Such as a man ought to
study all day, and not to be affected by any thing that is
not his own, neither by companion nor place nor gym-
nasia, and not even by his own body, but to remember the
law and to have it before his eyes. And what is the
divine law? To keep a man's own, not to claim that
which belongs to others, but to use what is given, and
when it is not given, not to desire it; and when a thing
is taken away, to give it up readily and immediately, and
to be thankful for the time that a man has had the use of
it, if you would not cry for your nurse and mamma. For
what matter does it make by what thing a man is subdued, and on what he depends? In what respect are you
better than he who cries for a girl, if you grieve for a
little gymnasium, and little porticoes and young men and
such places of amusement? Another comes and laments

<head>How we must adapt preconceptions to particular cases.</head>
<p>WHAT is the first business of him who philosophizes? To
throw away self-conceit (<foreign lang="greek">oi)/hsis</foreign>).<note anchored="yes">See ii. 11. 1, and iii. 14. 8.</note> For it is impossible for
a man to begin to learn that which he thinks that he
knows. As to things then which ought to be done and
ought not to be done, and good and bad, and beautiful
and ugly, all of us talking of them at random go to the
philosophers; and on these matters we praise, we censure,
we accuse, we blame, we judge and determine about principles honourable and dishonourable. But why do we go
to the philosophers? Because we wish to learn what we do
not think that we know. And what is this? Theorems.<note anchored="yes">Theorems are defined by <placeName key="tgn,2027172">Cicero</placeName>, de Fato, c. 6, 'Percepta appelle
quae dicuntur Graece <foreign lang="greek">qewrh/mata</foreign>.'</note>
For we wish to learn what philosophers say as being
something elegant and acute; and some wish to learn that
<pb n="154"/>
they may get profit from what they learn. It is ridiculous
then to think that a person wishes to learn one thing, and
will learn another; or further, that a man will make proficiency in that which he does not learn. But the many
are deceived by this which deceived also the rhetorician
Theopompus,<note anchored="yes">This rhetorician or orator, as Epictetus names him, appears to be
the same person as Theopompus of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, the historian.</note> when he blames even Plato for wishing
everything to be defined. For what does he say? Did
none of us before you use the words Good or Just, or do
we utter the sounds in an unmeaning and empty way
without understanding what they severally signify? Now
who tells you, Theopompus, that we had not natural
notions of each of these things and preconceptions (<foreign lang="greek">prolh/yeis</foreign>)? But it is not possible to adapt preconceptions
to their correspondent objects if we have not distinguished
(analyzed) them, and inquired what object must be subjected to each preconception. You may make the same
charge against physicians also. For who among us did
not use the words healthy and unhealthy before Hippocrates lived, or did we utter these words as empty sounds?
For we have also a certain preconception of health,<note anchored="yes">'That Epictetus does not quite correctly compare the notion of
what is wholesome to the human body with the preconceived notion
(anticipata notione) of moral good and bad, will be apparent to those
who have carefully inquired into the various origin and principles of
oar notions.' Schweigh. Also see his note on <foreign lang="greek">a)na/teinon</foreign>.</note> but
we are not able to adapt it. For this reason one says,
abstain from food; another says, give food; another
says, bleed; and another says, use cupping. What is the
reason? is it any other than that a man cannot properly
adapt the preconception of health to particulars?</p>
<p>So it is in this matter also, in the things which concern
life. Who among us does not speak of good and bad, of
useful and not useful; for who among us has not a preconception of each of these things? Is it then a distinct
and perfect preconception? Show this. How shall I show
this? Adapt the preconception properly to the particular
things. Plato, for instance, subjects definitions to the
preconception of the useful, but you to the preconception
of the useless. Is it possible then that both of you are
<pb n="155"/>
right? How is it possible? Does not one man adapt
the preconception of good to the matter of wealth, and
another not to wealth, but to the matter of pleasure and to
that of health? For, generally, if all of us who use those
words know sufficiently each of them, and need no diligence in resolving (making distinct) the notions of the
preconceptions, why do we differ, why do we quarrel, why
do we blame one another?</p>
<p>And why do I now allege this contention with one another and speak of it? If you yourself properly adapt your
preconceptions, why are you unhappy, why are you hindered? Let us omit at present the second topic about the
pursuits (<foreign lang="greek">o(/rmas</foreign>) and the study of the duties which relate to
them. Let us omit also the third topic, which relates to the
assents (<foreign lang="greek">sugkataqe/seis</foreign>): I give up to you these two topics.
Let us insist upon the first, which presents an almost
obvious demonstration that we do not properly adapt the
preconoeptions.<note anchored="yes">The topic of the desires and aversions. Sec. iii. c. 2.</note> Do you now desire that which is possible

<head>How we should struggle against appearances.</head>
<p>EVERY habit and faculty<note anchored="yes">See iv. c. 12.</note> is maintained and increased by
the corresponding actions: the habit of walking by walking, the habit of running by running. If you would be a
good reader, read; if a writer, write. But when you shall
not have read for thirty days in succession, but have done
something else, you will know the consequence. In the
same way, if you shall have lain down ten days, get up
<pb n="159"/>
and attempt to make a long walk, and you will see how
your legs are weakened. Generally then if you would
make any thing a habit, do it; if you would not make it
a habit, do not do it, but accustom yourself to do something
else in place of it.</p>
<p>So it is with respect to the affections of the soul: when
you have been angry, you must know that not only has
this evil befallen you, but that you have also increased the
habit, and in a manner thrown fuel upon fire. When you
have been overcome in sexual intercourse with a person,
do not reckon this single defeat only, but reckon that you
have also nurtured, increased your incontinence. For it
is impossible for habits and faculties, some of them not to
be produced, when they did not exist before, and others
not be increased and strengthened by corresponding acts.</p>
<p>In this manner certainly, as philosophers say, also diseases of the mind grow up.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)r)r(wsth/mata</foreign>. 'Aegrotationes quae appellantur a Stoicis
<foreign lang="greek">a)r)r(wsth/mata</foreign>' <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>, Tusc. iv. 10.</note> For when you have once
desired money, if reason be applied to lead to a perception of the evil, the desire is stopped, and the ruling
faculty of our mind is restored to the original authority.
But if you apply no means of cure, it no longer returns to
the same state, but being again excited by the corresponding appearance, it is inflamed to desire quicker than before: and when this takes place continually, it is henceforth hardened (made callous), and the disease of the mind
confirms the love of money. For he who has had a fever,
and has been relieved from it, is not in the same state
that he was before, unless he has been completely cured.
Something of the kind happens also in diseases of the soul.
Certain traces and blisters are left in it, and unless a man
shall completely efface them, when he is again lashed on
the same places, the lash will produce not blisters (weals)
but sores. If then you wish not to be of an angry temper,
do not feed the habit: throw nothing on it which will
increase it: at first keep quiet, and count the days on
which you have not been angry. I used to be in passion
every day; now every second day; then every third, then
every fourth. But if you have intermitted thirty days,
make a sacrifice to God. For the habit at first begins to
<pb n="160"/>
be weakened, and then is completely destroyed. <quote>I have

herself and lying down by my side. I stroke my head
and say, Well done, Epictetus, you have solved a fine little
sophism, much finer than that which is called the master
sophism. And if even the woman is willing, and gives
signs, and sends messages, and if she also fondle me and
come close to me, and I should abstain and be victorious,
that would be a sophism beyond that which is named the

you to the test. And then do not allow the appearance to
lead you on and draw lively pictures of the things which
will follow; for if you do, it will carry you off wherever
it pleases. But rather bring in to oppose it some other
beautiful and noble appearance and cast out this base
appearance. And if you are accustomed to be exercised

between one another in these three propositions, each two
being in contradiction to the third. The propositions are,
that every thing past must of necessity be true; that an
impossibility does not follow a possibility; and that a thing
is possible which neither is nor will be true. Diodorus<note anchored="yes">Diodorus, surnamed Cronus, lived at <placeName key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> in the time of

observing this contradiction employed the probative force
of the first two for the demonstration of this proposition,
That nothing is possible which is not tine and never will

be. Now another will hold these two: That something is
possible. which is neither true nor ever will be: and That
an impossibility does not follow a possibility. But he
will not allow that every thing which is past is necessarily
true, as the followers of Cleanthes seem to think, and
Antipater copiously defended them. But others maintain
the other two propositions, That a thing is possible which
is neither true nor will be true: and That everything
which is past is necessarily true; but then they will
maintain that an impossibility can follow a possibility.
But it is impossible to maintain these three propositions,
because of their common contradiction.<note anchored="yes">If you assume any two of these three, they must be in contradiction

<p>If then any man should ask me, which of these propositions do you maintain? I will answer him, that I do

think, and Cleanthes maintained another opinion, and
those of Chrysippus a third. What then is your opinion?

I differ not at all from the grammarian. Who was <placeName key="tgn,2039313">Hector</placeName>'s
father? Priam. Who were his brothers? Alexander and
Deiphobus. Who was their mother? Hecuba.&mdash;I have
heard this story. From whom? From Homer. And Hellanicus also, I think, writes about the same things, and
perhaps others like him. And what further have I about
the ruling argument? Nothing. But, if I am a vain
man, especially at a banquet I surprise the guests by
enumerating those who have written on these matters.
Both Chrysippus has written wonderfully in his first book
about Possibilities, and Cleanthes has written specially on
the subject, and Archedemus. Antipater also has written
not only in his work about Possibilities, but also separately
in his work on the ruling argument. Have you not read
the work? I have not read it. Read. And what profit
will 'a man have from it? he will be more trifling and
impertinent than he is now; for what else have you
gained by reading it? What opinion have you formed on
<pb n="164"/>
this subject? none; but you will tell us of Helen and
Priam, and the island of Calypso which never was and
never will be. And in this matter indeed it is of no great
importance if you retain the story, but have formed no
opinion of your own. But in matters of morality (Ethic)
this happens to us much more than in these things of
which we are speaking.</p>
<p>Speak to me about good and evil. Listen:
<quote rend="blockquote">The wind from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> to Ciconian shores
Brought me.<note anchored="yes">'Speak to me,' etc. may be supposed to be said to Epictetus, who
has been ridiculing logical subtleties and the grammarians' learning.
When he is told to speak of good and evil, he takes a verse of the
Odyssey, the first which occurs to him, and says, Listen. There is
nothing to listen to, but it is as good for the hearer as any thing else.
Then he utters some philosophical principles, and being asked where
he learned them, he says, from Hellanicus, who was an historian, not
a philosopher. He is bantering the hearer: it makes no matter from
what author I learned them; it is all the same. The real question is,
have you examined what Good and 'Evil are, and have you formed an
opinion yourself?</note>&mdash;Odyssey, ix. 39.</quote></p>
<p>Of things some are good, some are bad, and others are
indifferent. The good then are the virtues and the things
which partake of the virtues: the bad are the vices, and
the things which partake of them; and the indifferent are
the things which lie between the virtues and the vices,
wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, pain. Whence do you
know this? Hellanicus says it in his Egyptian history;
for what difference does it make to say this, or to say that
Diogenes has it in his Ethic, or Chrysippus or Cleanthes?
Have you then examined any of these things and formed
an opinion of your own? Show how you are used to
behave in a storm on shipboard? Do you remember this
division (distinction of things), when the sail rattles and
a man, who knows nothing of times and seasons, stands by
you when you are screaming and says, Tell me, I ask you
by the Gods, what you were saying just now, Is it a vice
to suffer shipwreck: does it participate in vice? Will you
not take up a stick and lay it on his head? What have
we to do with you, man? we are perishing and you come
<pb n="165"/>
to mock us? But if Caesar send for you to answer a
charge, do you remember the distinction? If when you
are going in pale and trembling, a person should come up
to you and say, Why do you tremble, man? what is the
matter about which you are engaged? Does Caesar who
sits within give virtue and vice to those who go in to
him? You reply, Why do you also mock me and add
to my present sorrows?&mdash;Still tell me, philosopher, tell
me why you tremble? Is it not death of which you run
the risk, or a prison, or pain of the body, or banishment,
or disgrace? What else is there? Is there any vice or
anything which partakes of vice? What then did you
use to say of these things?&mdash;'What have you to do with
me, man? my own evils are enough for me.' And you
say right. Your own evils are enough for you, your
baseness, your cowardice, your boasting which you showed
when you sat in the school. Why did you decorate yourself
with what belonged to others? Why did you call yourself
a Stoic?</p>
<p>Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you will
find to what sect you belong. You will find that most of
you are Epicureans, a few Peripatetics,<note anchored="yes">The Peripatetics allowed many things to be good which contributed

For wherein will you show that you really consider virtue
equal to everything else or even superior? But show me
a Stoic, if you can. Where or how? But you can show
me an endless number who utter small arguments of the
Stoics. For do the same persons repeat the Epicurean
opinions any worse? And the Peripatetic, do they not
handle them also with equal accuracy? who then is a
Stoic? As we call a statue Phidiac, which is fashioned
according to the art of Phidias; so show me a man who

or that treating a subject practically and in earnest leads men to such

But you cannot. Why then do you delude yourselves and
cheat others? and why do you put on a guise which
does not belong to you, and walk about being thieves and
pilferers of these names and things which do not belong
to you?</p>
<p>And now I am your teacher, and you are instructed in
my school. And I have this purpose, to make you free
from restraint, compulsion, hindrance, to make you free,
prosperous, happy, looking to God in everything small
and great. And you are here to learn and practise these
things. Why then do you not finish the work, if you also
have such a purpose as you ought to have, and if I in addition to the purpose also have such qualification as I ought
to have? What is that which is wanting? When I see
an artificer and material lying by him, I expect the work.
Here then is the artificer, here the material; what is it
that we want? Is not the thing one that can be taught?
It is. Is it not then in our power? The only thing of all
<pb n="167"/>
that is in our power. Neither wealth is in our power, nor
health, nor reputation, nor in a word any thing else except
the right use of appearances. This (right use) is by nature
free from restraint, this alone is free from impediment.
Why then do you not finish the work? Tell me the reason.
For it is either through my fault that you do not finish it,
or through your own fault, or through the nature of the
thing. The thing itself is possible, and the only thing
in our power. It remains then that the fault is either in
me or in you, or, what is nearer the truth, in both. Well
then, are you willing that we begin at last to bring such
a purpose into this school, and to take no notice of the
past? Let us only make a beginning. Trust to me, and
you will see.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<head>Against the Epicureans and Academics.</head>
<p>THE propositions which are true and evident are of necessity used even by those who contradict them: and a man
might perhaps consider it to be the greatest proof of a
thing being evident that it is found to be necessary even
for him who denies it to make use of it at the same time.
For instance, if a man should deny that there is anything
universally true, it is plain that he must make the contradictory negation, that nothing is universally true. What,
wretch, do you not admit even this? For what else is
this than to affirm that whatever is universally affirmed
is false? Again if a man should come forward and say:
Know that there is nothing that can be known,<note anchored="yes">'Itaque Arcesilas negabat esse quidquam quod soiri posset, ne
illud quidem ipsum, quod <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> sibi reliquisset. Sic omnia latere
censebat in occulto, neque ease quidquam quod oerni aut intelligi
possit. Quibus de causis nihil oportere neque profiteri neque adfirmare
quemquam neque adsensione adprobare.' <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>, Academ. Post. 1. 12,
Diog. Laert. ix. 90 of the Pyrrhonists.</note> but all
things are incapable of sure evidence; or if another say,
Believe me and you will be the better for it, that a man
<pb n="168"/>
ought not to believe any thing; or again, if another should
say, Learn from me, man, that it is not possible to learn
any thing; I tell you this and will teach you, if you choose.
Now in what respect do these differ from those? Whom
shall I name? Those who call themselves Academics?
'Men, agree [with us] that no man agrees [with another]:
believe us that no man believes anybody.'</p>
<p>Thus Epicurus<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2239741">Cicero</placeName>, de Fin. ii. 30. 31, speaking of the letter, which Epicurus
wrote to Hermarchus when he was dying, says 'that the actions of
Epicurus were inconsistent with his sayings,' and 'his writings were
confuted by his probity and morality.'</note> also, when he designs to destroy the
natural fellowship of mankind, at the same time makes use
of that which he destroys. For what does he say? 'Be
not deceived, men, nor be led astray, nor be mistaken:
there is no natural fellowship among rational animals;
believe me. But those who say otherwise, deceive you
and seduce you by false reasons.'&mdash;What is this to you?
Permit us to be deceived. Will you fare worse, if all the
rest of us are persuaded that there is a natural fellowship
among us, and that it ought by all means to be preserved?
Nay, it will be much better and safer for you. Man, why do
you trouble yourself about us? Why do you keep awake
for us? Why do you light your lamp? Why do you rise
early? Why do you write so many books, that no one of
us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they
take care of men; or that no one may suppose the nature
of good to be other than pleasure? For if this is so, lie
down and sleep, and lead the life of a worm, of which you
judged yourself worthy: eat and drink, and enjoy women,
and ease yourself, and snore.<note anchored="yes">Paul says, Cor. i. 15. 32: 'If after the manner of men I have fought
with beasts at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?
let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' The words 'let us eat
and drink, etc.' are said to be a quotation from the Thais of Menander.
The meaning seems to be, that if I do not believe in the resurrection of
the dead, why should I not enjoy the sensual pleasures of life only?
This is not the doctrine of Epictetus, as we see in the text.</note> And what is it to you, how
the rest shall think about these things, whether right or
wrong? For what have we to do with you? You take
care of sheep because they supply us with wool and milk,
and last of all with their flesh. Would it not be a desirable
<pb n="169"/>
thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by the Stoics,
and sleep and present themselves to you and to those like
you to be shorn and milked? For this you ought to say to
your brother Epicureans: but ought you not to conceal it
from others, and particularly before every thing to persuade
them, that we are by nature adapted for fellowship, that
temperance is a good thing; in order that all things may
be secured for you?<note anchored="yes">It would give security to the Epicureans, that they would enjoy
all that they value, if other men should be persuaded that we are
all made for fellowship, and that temperance is a good thing.</note> Or ought we to maintain this fellowship with some and not with others? With whom then
ought we to maintain it? With such as on their part also
maintain it, or with such as violate this fellowship? And
who violate it more than you who establish such doctrines?</p>
<p>What then was it that waked Epicurus from his sleepiness, and compelled him to write what he did write?
What else was it than that which is the strongest thing
in men, nature, which draws a man to her own will though
he be unwilling and complaining? For since, she says,
you think that there is no community among mankind,
write this opinion and leave it for others, and break your
sleep to do this, and by your own practice condemn your own
opinions. Shall we then say that Orestes was agitated by
the Erinyes (Furies) and roused from his deep sleep, and
did not more savage Erinyes and Pains rouse Epicurus
from his sleep and not allow him to rest, but compelled
him to make known his own evils, as madness and wine
did the Galli (the priests of Cybele)? So strong and invincible is man's nature, For how can a vine be moved
not in the manner of a vine, but in the manner of an
olive tree? or on the other hand how can an olive tree be
moved not in the manner of an olive tree, but in the
manner of a vine? It is impossible: it cannot be conceived. Neither then is it possible for a man completely
to lose the movements (affects) of a man; and even those
who are deprived of their genital members are not able to
deprive themselves of man's desires.<note anchored="yes">See <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>'s note.</note> Thus Epicurus also
mutilated all the offices of a man, and of a father of a
family, and of a citizen and of a friend, but he did not
<pb n="170"/>
mutilate human desires, for he could not; not more than
the lazy Academics can cast away or blind their own
senses, though they have tried with all their might to do
it. What a shame is this? when a man has received from
nature measures and rules for the knowing of truth, and
does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to
improve<note anchored="yes">I have followed Schweighaeuser who suggests <foreign lang="greek">prosecerga/sasqai</foreign>

you think that they are? If you like, I will demonstrate
that they are good things. Well, demonstrate it that our
citizens may be turned and honour the deity and may no
longer be negligent about things of the highest value.
Have you then the demonstrations?&mdash;I have, and I am
thankful.&mdash;Since then you are well pleased with them, hear
the contrary: That there are no Gods, and, if there are, they
take no care of men, nor is there any fellowship between
us and them; and that this piety and sanctity which is
talked of among most men is the lying of boasters and
sophists, or certainly of legislators for the purpose of
terrifying and checking wrong doers.<note anchored="yes">Polybius (vi. 56), when he is speaking of the Roman state, commends the men of old time, who established in the minds of the multitude the opinions about the gods and Hades, wherein, he says, they

<head>Of inconsistency.</head><note anchored="yes">Schweig. has some remarks on the title of this chapter. He says
'that this discourse does not keep to the same subject, but proceeds
from that with which it began to other things.'</note>
<p>SOME things men readily confess, and other things they do
not. No one then will confess that he is a fool or without
understanding; but quite the contrary you will hear all
men saying, I wish that I had fortune equal to my understanding. But men readily confess that they are timid,
and they say: I am rather timid, I confess; but as to
other respects you will not find me to be foolish. A man
will not readily confess that he is intemperate; and that
he is unjust, he will not confess at all. He will by no
means confess that he is envious or a busy body. Most
men will confess that they are compassionate. What
then is the reason?&mdash;The chief thing (the ruling thing)
is inconsistency and confusion in the things which relate
to good and evil. But different men have different reasons;
and generally what they imagine to be base, they do not
confess at all. But they suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good disposition, and compassion also; but
silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave. And
they do not at all admit (confess) the things which are.
offences against society. But in the case of most errors
for this reason chiefly they are induced to confess them,
because they imagine that there is something involuntary
in them as in timidity and compassion; and if a man
confess that he is in any respect intemperate, he alleges
love (or passion) as an excuse for what is involuntary.
But men do not imagine injustice to be at all involuntary.
There is also in jealousy, as they suppose, something involuntary; and for this reason they confess to jealousy
also.</p>
<p>Living then among such men, who are so confused, so
ignorant of what they say, and of the evils which they
have or have not, and why they have them, or how they
shall be relieved of them, I think it is worth the trouble
<pb n="174"/>
for a man to watch constantly (and to ask) whether I also
am one of them, what imagination I have about myself,
how I conduct myself, whether I conduct myself as a
prudent man, whether I conduct myself as a temperate
man, whether I ever say this, that I have been taught to
be prepared for every thing that may happen. Have I
the consciousness, which a man who knows nothing ought
to have, that I know nothing? Do I go to my teacher as
men go to oracles, prepared to obey? or do I like a snivel-
ling boy go to my school to learn history and understand
the books which I did not understand before, and, if it

him who is suffering from dysentery, ask me if vinegar is
useful; I will say that it is useful.&mdash;Will it then be useful
to me?&mdash;I will say, no. Seek first for the discharge to
be stopped and the ulcers to be closed. And do you, O
men, first cure the ulcers and stop the discharge; be tranquil in your mind, bring it free from distraction into the
school, and you will know what power reason has.

<head>On friendship.</head><note anchored="yes">'In this dissertation is expounded the Stoic principle that friendship is only possible between the good.' Schweig. He also says that
there was another discourse by Epictetus on this subject, in which he
expressed some of the opinions of Musonius Rufus (i. 1. note 12).
Schweig draws this conclusion from certain words of Stobaeus; and he
supposes that this dissertation of Epictetus was in one of the last four
books of Epictetus' discourses by Arrian, which have been lost.
<p>Cicero (de Amicit. c. 5) says 'nisi in bonis amicitiam ease non posse,
and c. 18.</p></note>
<p>WHAT a man applies himself to earnestly, that he natu-
rally loves. Do men then apply themselves earnestly to
the things which are bad? By no means. Well, do they
apply themselves to things which in no way concern
themselves? not to these either. It remains then that
they employ themselves earnestly only about things which
are good; and if they are earnestly employed about things,
they love such things also. Whoever then understands
what is good, can also know how to love: but he who
cannot distinguish good from bad, and things which are
neither good nor bad from both, how can he possess the
power of loving? To love then is only in the power of
the wise.</p>
<p>How is this? a man may say; I am foolish, and yet I
love my child.&mdash;I am surprised indeed that you have
begun by making the admission that you are foolish. For
what are you deficient in? Can you not make use of
your senses? do you not distinguish appearances? do you
not use food which is suitable for your body, and clothing
and habitation? Why then do you admit that you are
foolish? It is in truth because you are often disturbed by
appearances and perplexed, and their power of persuasion
often conquers you; and sometimes you think these things
to be good, and then the same things to be bad, and lastly
neither good nor bad; and in short you grieve, fear, envy,
are disturbed, you are changed. This is the reason why
you confess that you are foolish. And are you not changeable in love? But wealth, and pleasure and in a word
<pb n="177"/>
things themselves, do you sometimes think them to be
good, and sometimes bad? and do you not think the same
men at one time to be good, at another time bad? and
have you not at one time a friendly feeling towards them,
and at another time the feeling of an enemy? and do you
not at one time praise them, and at another time blame
them? Yes; I have these feelings also. Well then, do
you think that he who has been deceived about a man is
his friend? Certainly not. And he who has selected a
man as his friend and is of a changeable disposition, has
he good will towards him? He has not. And he who
now abuses a man, and afterwards admires him? This
man also has no good will to the other. Well then, did
you never see little dogs caressing and playing with one
another, so that you might say, there is nothing more
friendly? but that you may know what friendship is,
throw a bit of flesh among them, and you will learn.
Throw between yourself and your son a little estate, and
you will know how soon he will wish to bury you and
how soon you wish your son to die. Then you will change
your tone and say, what a son I have brought up! He
has long been wishing to bury me. Throw a smart girl
between you; and do you the old man love her, and the
young one will love her too. If a little fame intervene
or dangers, it will be just the same. You will utter the
words of the father of Admetus!
<quote rend="blockquote">Life gives you pleasure: and why not your father?</quote><note anchored="yes">The first verse is from the Alcestis of Euripides, v. 691. The second

<p>Do you think that Admetus did not love his own child
when he was little? that he was not in agony when the
child had a fever? that he did not often say, I wish I had
the fever instead of the child? then when the test (the
thing) came and was near, see what words they utter.
Were not Eteocles and Polynices from the same mother
and from the same father? Were they not brought up
together, had they not lived together, drunk together,
slept together, and often kissed one another? So that, if
<pb n="178"/>
any man, I think, had seen them, he would have ridiculed
the philosophers for the paradoxes which they utter about
friendship. But when a quarrel rose between them about
the royal power, as between dogs about a bit of meat, see
what they say
<quote rend="blockquote"><hi rend="ital">Polynices.</hi> Where will you take your station

Such are the wishes that they utter.</p>
<p>For universally, be not deceived, every animal is
attached to nothing so much as to its own interest.<note anchored="yes">Compare Euripides, Hecuba, v. 846, etc.:&mdash;

Whatever then appears to it an impediment to this interest,
whether this be a brother, or a father, or a child, or
beloved, or lover, it hates, spurns, curses: for its nature is
to love nothing so much as its own interest; this is father,
and brother and kinsman, and country, and God. When
then the gods appear to us to be an impediment to this,
we abuse them and throw down their statues and burn
their temples, as Alexander ordered the temples of Aes-
culapius to be burned when his dear friend died.<note anchored="yes">Alexander did this when Hephaestion died. Arrian. Expedition
of Alexander, vii. 14.</note>
For this reason if a man put in the same place his
interest, sanctity, goodness, and country, and parents, and
friends, all these are secured: but if he puts in one place
his interest, in another his friends, and his country and
his kinsmen and justice itself, all these give way being
borne down by the weight of interest. For where the I
and the Mine are placed, to that place of necessity the
animal inclines: if in the flesh, there is the ruling power:
if in the will, it is there: and if it is in externals, it is
<pb n="179"/>
there.<note anchored="yes">Matthew vi. 21, 'for where your treasure is, there will your heart
be also.'</note> If then I am there where my will is, then only
shall I be a friend such as I ought to be, and son, and
father; for this will be my interest, to maintain the
character of fidelity, of modesty, of patience, of abstinence,
of active co&mdash;operation, of observing my relations (towards
all). But if I put myself in one place, and honesty in
another, then the doctrine of Epicurus becomes strong,
which asserts either that there is no honesty or it is that
which opinion holds to be honest (virtuous).<note anchored="yes">'By <quote>self</quote> is here meant the proper Good, or, as Solomon expresses
it, Eccl. xii. 13, <quote>the whole of man.</quote> The Stoic proves excellently the
inconvenience of placing this in any thing but a right choice (a right
disposition and behaviour): but how it is the interest of each
individual in every case to make that choice in preference to present
pleasure and in defiance of present sufferings, appears only from
the doctrine of a future recompense. Mrs. Carter. Compare Cicero,
De Fin. ii. 15, where he is speaking of Epicurus, and translates

<p>It was through this ignorance that the Athenians and
the Lacedaemonians quarrelled, and the Thebans with
both; and the great king quarrelled with <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, and the
Macedonians with both; and the Romans with the Getae.<note anchored="yes">The quarrels of the Athenians with the Lacedaemonians appear
chiefly in the history of the Peloponnesian war. (Thucydides, i. 1).
The quarrel of the great king, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, is the subject of
the history of Herodotus (i. 1). The great quarrel of the Macedonians with the Persians is the subject of Arrian's expedition of
Alexander. The Romans were at war with the Getae or Daci in
the time of Trajan, and we may assume that Epictetus was still
living then.</note>
And still earlier the Trojan war happened for these
reasons. Alexander was the guest of Menelaus; and if
any man had seen their friendly disposition, he would not
have believed any one who said that they were not friends.
But there was cast between them (as between dogs) a bit
of meat, a handsome woman, and about her war arose.
And now when you see brothers to be friends appearing to
have one mind, do not conclude from this any thing about
their friendship, not even if they swear it and say that it is
impossible for them to be separated from one another. For
<pb n="180"/>
the ruling principle of a bad man cannot be trusted, it is
insecure, has no certain rule by which it is directed, and
is overpowered at different times by different appearances.<note anchored="yes">Aristotle, Eth. viii. c. 8. Mrs. Carter.</note>
But examine, not what other men examine, if they are
born of the same parents and brought up together, and
under the same paedagogue; but examine this only,
wherein they place their interest, whether in externals or
in the will. If in externals, do not name them friends, no
more than name them trustworthy or constant, or brave
or free: do not name them even men, if you have any
judgment. For that is not a principle of human nature
which makes them bite one another, and abuse one another,
and occupy deserted places or public places, as if they
were mountains,<note anchored="yes">Schweig. thinks that this is the plain meaning: 'as wild beasts
in the mountains lie in wait for men, so men lie in wait for men, not
only in deserted places, but even in the forum.'</note> and in the courts of justice display the
acts of robbers; nor yet that which makes them intemperate and adulterers and corrupters, nor that which
makes them do whatever else men do against one another
through this one opinion only, that of placing themselves
and their interests in the things which are not within the
power of their will. But if you hear that in truth these
men think the good to be only there, where will is, and
where there is a right use of appearances, no longer
trouble yourself whether they are father or son, or
brothers, or have associated a long time and are companions, but when you have ascertained this only, confidently declare that they are friends, as you declare that
they are faithful, that they are just. For where else is
friendship than where there is fidelity, and modesty,
where there is a communion<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o(/pou do/sis tou= kalou=</foreign>.

<p>But you may say, such a one treated me with regard so
lung; and did he not love me? How do you know, slave,
if he did not regard you in the same way as he wipes his
<pb n="181"/>
shoes with a sponge, or as he takes care of his beast? How
do you know, when you have ceased to be useful as a
vessel, he will not throw you away like a broken platter?
But this woman is my wife, and we have lived together so
long. And how long did Eriphyle live with Amphiaraus,
and was the mother of children and of many? But a
necklace<note anchored="yes">The old story about Eriphyle who betrayed her husband for a
necklace.</note> came between them: and what is a necklace?
It is the opinion about such things. That was the bestial
principle, that was the thing which broke asunder the
friendship between husband and wife, that which did not
allow the woman to be a wife nor the mother to be a
mother. And let every man among you who has seriously
resolved either to be a friend himself or to have another for
his friend, cut out these opinions, hate them, drive them from
his soul. And thus first of all he will not reproach himself,
he will not be at variance with himself, he will not change
his mind, he will not torture himself. In the next place, to
another also, who is like himself, he will be altogether and
completely a friend.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note</note> But he will bear with the man
who is unlike himself, he will be kind to him, gentle, ready
to pardon on account of his ignorance, on account of his
being mistaken in things of the greatest importance; but
he will be harsh to no man, being well convinced of
Plato's doctrine that every mind is deprived of truth
unwillingly. If you cannot do this, yet you can do in all
other respects as friends do, drink together, and lodge
together, and sail together, and you may be born of the
same parents; for snakes also are: but neither will they
be friends nor you, so long as you retain these bestial and
cursed opinions.

<head>On the power of speaking.</head>
<p>EVERY man will read a book with more pleasure or even
with more ease, if it is written in fairer characters. Therefore every man will also listen more readily to what is
spoken, if it is signified by appropriate and becoming
words. We must not say then that there is no faculty
of expression: for this affirmation is the characteristic of
an impious and also of a timid man. Of an impious man,
because he undervalues the gifts which come from God,
just as if he would take away the commodity of the power
of vision, or of hearing, or of seeing. Has then God
given you eyes to no purpose? and to no purpose has he
infused into them a spirit<note anchored="yes">The word for 'spirit' is <foreign lang="greek">pneu=ma</foreign>, a vital spirit, an animal spirit,
a nervous fluid, as Schweighaeuser explains it, or as Plutarch says
(De Placit. Philosoph. iv. 15). 'the spirit which has the power of
vision, which permeates from the chief faculty of the mind to the pupil
of the eye;' and in another passage of the same treatise (iv. 8), 'the
instruments of perception are said to be intelligent spirits (<foreign lang="greek">pneu/mata noera/</foreign>) which have a motion from the chief faculty of the mind to the
organs.'</note> so strong and of such skilful
contrivance as to reach a long way and to fashion the
forms of things which are seen? What messenger is so
swift and vigilant? And to no purpose has he made the
interjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the
vision penetrates through the atmosphere which is in a
manner moved?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> And to no purpose has he made light,
without the presence of which there would be no use in
any other thing?</p>
<p>Man, be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget
the things which are superior to them. But indeed for the
power of seeing and hearing, and indeed for life itself, and
for the things which contribute to support it, for the fruits
which are dry, and for wine and oil give thanks to God:
but remember that he has given you something else better
than all these, I mean the power of using them, proving
them and estimating the value of each. For what is that
<pb n="183"/>
whom gives information about each of these powers, what
each of them is worth?<note anchored="yes">See i. 1.</note> Is it each faculty itself? Did
you ever hear the faculty of vision saying any thing about
itself? or the faculty of hearing? or wheat, or barley, or a
horse or a dog? No; but they are appointed as ministers
and slaves to serve the faculty which has the power of
making use of the appearances of things. And if you
inquire what is the value of each thing, of whom do you
inquire? who answers you? How then can any other
faculty be more powerful than this, which uses the rest as
ministers and itself proves each and pronounces about
them? for which of them knows what itself is, and what
is its own value? which of them knows when it ought
to employ itself and when not? what faculty is it which
opens and closes the eyes, and turns them away from
objects to which it ought not to apply them and does
apply them to other objects? Is it the faculty of vision?
No; but it is the faculty of the will. What is that faculty
which closes and opens the ears? what is that by which
they are curious and inquisitive, or on the contrary unmoved by what is said? is it the faculty of hearing?
It is no other than the faculty of the will.<note anchored="yes">Schweighaeuser has this note: 'That which Epictetus names the
<foreign lang="greek">proairetikh\ dunami/s</foreign> and afterwards frequently <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, is generally
translated by 'voluntas' (will); but it has a wider meaning than is
generally given to the Latin word, and it comprehends the intellect
with the will, and all the active power of the mind which we sometimes
designate by the general name Reason.'</note> Will this
faculty then, seeing that it is amidst all the other faculties
which are blind and dumb and unable to see any thing
else except the very acts for which they are appointed in
order to minister to this (faculty) and serve it, but this
faculty alone sees sharp and sees what is the value of each
of the rest; will this faculty declare to us that any thing
else is the best, or that itself is? And what else does the
eye do when it is opened than see? But whether we ought
to look on the wife of a certain person, and in what
manner, who tells us? The faculty of the will. And
whether we ought to believe what is said or not to believe
it, and if we do believe, whether we ought to be moved by
it or not, who tells us? Is it not the faculty of the will?
<pb n="184"/>
But this faculty of speaking and of ornamenting words,
if there is indeed any such peculiar faculty, what else does
it do, when there happens to be discourse about a thing,
than to ornament the words and arrange them as hairdressers do the hair? But whether it is better to speak
or to be silent, and better to speak in this way or that
way, and whether this is becoming or not becoming, and
the season for each and the use, what else tells us than
the faculty of the will? Would you have it then to come
forward and condemn itself?</p>
<p>What then? it (the will) says,<note anchored="yes">On the Greek text <placeName key="tgn,1030954">Upton</placeName> remarks that, 'there are many passages
in these dissertations which are ambiguous or rather confused on
account of the small questions, and because the matter is not
expanded by oratorical copiousness, not to mention other causes.'</note> if the fact is so, can
that which ministers be superior to that to which it
ministers, can the horse be superior to the rider, or the
dog to the huntsman, or the instrument to the musician,
or the servants to the king? What is that which makes
use of the rest? The will. What takes care of all? The
will. What destroys the whole man, at one time by
hunger, at another time by hanging, and at another time
by a precipice? The will. Then is any thing stronger
in men than this? and how is it possible that the things
which are subject to restraint are stronger than that which
is not? What things are naturally formed to hinder the
faculty of vision? Both will and things which do not
depend on the faculty of the will.<note anchored="yes">The general reading is <foreign lang="greek">kai\ proaireta/</foreign>. Salmasius proposes <foreign lang="greek">kai\ a)proai/reta</foreign>, which Schweig. says in a note that he accepts, and so
he translates it in the Latin; but in his text he has <foreign lang="greek">kai\ proaireta/</foreign>.</note> It is the same with
the faculty of hearing, with the faculty of speaking in
like manner. But what has a natural power of hindering the will? Nothing which is independent of the will;
but only the will itself, when it is perverted. Therefore
this (the will) is alone vice or alone virtue.</p>
<p>Then being so great a faculty and set over all the rest,
let it (the will) come forward and tell us that the most
excellent of all things is the flesh. Not even if the flesh
itself declared that it is the most excellent, would any
person bear that it should say this. But what is it, Epicurus, which pronounces this, which wrote about the End
<pb n="185"/>
(purpose) of our Being,<note anchored="yes">This appears to be the book which <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName> (Tuscul. iii. 18)
entitles on the 'supreme good' (de summo bono), which, as Cicero,
says, contains all the doctrine of Epicurus. The book on the Canon
or Rule is mentioned by Velleius in Cicero de Nat. Deorum i. c. 16.
as 'that celestial volume of Epicurus on the Rule and Judgment.
See also De Fin. i. 19.</note> which wrote on the Nature of
Things, which wrote about the Canoa (rule of truth),
which led you to wear a beard, which wrote when it was
dying that it was spending the last and a happy day?<note anchored="yes">This is said in a letter written by Epicurus, when he was
dying in great pain (Diog. Laert. x. 22); Cicen) (De Fin. ii. c. 30)
quotes this letter.</note>
Was this the flesh or the will? Then do you admit that
you possess any thing superior to this (the will)? and are
you not mad? are you in fact so blind and deaf?</p>
<p>What then? does any man despise the other faculties?
I hope not. Does any man say that there is no use or
excellence in the speaking faculty?<note anchored="yes">The MSS. have <foreign lang="greek">proairetikh=s duna/mews</foreign>. Lord Shaftesbury suggested <foreign lang="greek">frastikh=s</foreign> and Salmasius also. Schweig. has put <foreign lang="greek">frastikh=s</foreign> in the text, and he has done right.</note> I hope not. That
would be foolish, impious, ungrateful towards God. But
a man renders to each thing its due value. For there is
some use even in an ass, but not so much as in an ox:
there is also use in a dog, but not so much as in a slave:
there is also some use in a slave, but not so much as in
citizens: there is also some use in citizens, but not so
much as in magistrates. Not indeed because some things
are superior, must we undervalue the use which other
things have. There is a certain value in the power of
speaking, but it is not so great as the power of the will.
When then I speak thus, let no man think that I ask you
to neglect the power of speaking, for neither do I ask you
to neglect the eyes, nor the ears nor the hands nor the feet,
nor clothing nor shoes. But if you ask me what then is
the most excellent of all things, what must I say? I
cannot say the power of speaking, but the power of the
will, when it is right (<foreign lang="greek">o)rqh\</foreign>). For it is this which uses
the other (the power of speaking), and all the other
faculties both small and great. For when this faculty of
the will is set right, a man who is not good becomes good:
<pb n="186"/>
but when it fails, a man becomes bad. It is through this
that we are unfortunate, that we are fortunate, that we
blame one another, are pleased with one another. In a
word, it is this which if we neglect it makes unhappiness,
and if we carefully look after it, makes happiness.</p>
<p>But to take away the faculty of speaking and to say
that there is no such faculty in reality, is the act not only
of an ungrateful man towards those who gave it, but also
of a cowardly man: for such a person seems to me to fear,
if there is any faculty of this kind, that we shall not be
able to despise it. Such also are those who say that there
is no difference between beauty and ugliness. Then it
would happen that a man would be affected in the same
way if he saw Thersites and if he saw Achilles; in the
same way, if he saw Helen and any other woman. But
these are foolish and clownish notions, and the notions of
men who know not the nature of each thing, but are afraid,
if a man shall see the difference, that he shall immediately
be seized and carried off vanquished. But this is the
great matter; to leave to each thing the power (faculty)
which it has, and leaving to it this power to see what is
the worth of the power, and to learn what is the most
excellent of all things, and to pursue this always, to be
diligent about this, considering all other things of second-
ary value compared with this, but yet, as far as we can,
not neglecting all those other things. For we must take
care of the eyes also, not as if they were the most excellent thing, but we must take care of them on account of
the most excellent thing, because it will not be in its true
natural condition, if it does not rightly use the ether
faculties, and prefer some things to others.</p>
<p>What then is usually done? Men generally act as a
traveller would do on his way to his own country, when
he enters a good inn, and being pleased with it should
remain there. Man, you have forgotten your purpose:
you were not travelling to this inn, but you were passing
through it.&mdash;But this is a pleasant inn.&mdash;And how many
other inns are pleasant? and how many meadows are
pleasant? yet only for passing through. But your purpose
is this, to return to your country, to relieve your kinsmen
of anxiety, to discharge the duties of a citizen, to marry, to

beget children, to fill the usual magistracies.<note anchored="yes">The Stoics taught that a man should lead an active life. <placeName key="tgn,2399200">Horace</placeName>

but this was only talk. The Stoic should discharge all the duties
of a citizen, says Epictetus; he should even marry and beget children.
But the marrying may be done without any sense of duty; and the
continuance of the human race is secured by the natural love of the
male and of the female for conjunction. Still it is good advice,
which the Roman censor Metellus gave to his fellow citizens, that,
as they could not live without women, they should make the beat
of this business of marriage. (<bibl n="Gel. 1.6">Gellius, i. 6</bibl>.)</note> For you
are not come to select more pleasant places, but to live
in these where you were born and of which you were made
a citizen. Something of the kind takes place in the matter
which we are considering. Since by the aid of speech and
such communication as you receive here you must advance
to perfection, and purge your will and correct the faculty
which makes use of the appearances of things; and since
it is necessary also for the teaching (delivery) of theorems
to be effected by a certain mode of expression and with a
certain variety and sharpness, some persons captivated by
these very things abide in them, one captivated by the expression, another by syllogisms, another again by sophisms,
and still another by some other inn (<foreign lang="greek">pandokei/ou</foreign>) of the kind;
and there they stay and waste away as if they were
among Sirens.</p>
<p>Man, your purpose (business) was to make yourself
capable of using comformably to nature the appearances
presented to you, in your desires not to be frustrated,
in your aversion from things not to fall into that which
you would avoid, never to have no luck (as one may say),
nor ever to have bad luck, to be free, not hindered, not
compelled, conforming yourself to the administration of
Zeus, obeying it, well satisfied with this, blaming no one,
charging no one with fault, able from your whole soul to

Then having this purpose before you, if some little form of

you abide among them and choose to dwell there,
forgetting the things at home, and do you say, These
things are fine? Who says that they are not fine? but
only as being a way home, as inns are. For what hinders

<head>To (or against) a person who was one of those who were not valued (esteemed) by him. </head>
<p>A CERTAIN person said to him (Epictetus): Frequently I
desired to hear you and came to you, and you never gave
me any answer: and now, if it is possible, I intreat you
to say something to me. Do you think, said Epictetus,
that as there is an art in any thing else, so there is also
an art in speaking, and that he who has the art, will speak
skilfully, and he who has not, will speak unskilfully?&mdash;
I do think so.&mdash;He then who by speaking receives benefit
<pb n="189"/>
himself, and is able to benefit others, will speak skilfully:
but he who is rather damaged by speaking and does damage
to others, will he be unskilled in this art of speaking?
And you may find that some are damaged and others benefited by speaking. And are all who hear benefited by
what they hear? Or will you find that among them also
some are benefited and some damaged?&mdash;There are both
among these also, he said.&mdash;In this case also then those
who hear skilfully are benefited, and those who hear
unskilfully are damaged? He admitted this. Is there
then a skill in hearing also, as there is in speaking?&mdash;
It seems so.&mdash;If you choose, consider the matter in this
way also. The practice of music, to whom does it belong?
To a musician. And the proper making of a statue, to
whom do you think that it belongs? To a statuary. And
the looking at a statue skilfully, does this appear to you
to require the aid of no art?&mdash;This also requires the aid
of art.&mdash;Then if speaking properly is the business of the
skilful man, do you see that to hear also with benefit is
the business of the skilful man.? Now as to speaking and
hearing perfectly, and usefully,<note anchored="yes">' That is, let us not now consider whether I am perfect in the art
of speaking, and you have a mind well prepared to derive real advantage
from philosophical talk. Let us consider this only, whether your ears
are sufficiently prepared for listening, whether you can understand a
philosophical discussion.' Schweig.</note> let us for the present, if you
please, say no more, for both of us are a long way from
every thing of the kind. But I think that every man will
allow this, that he who is going to hear philosophers
requires some amount of practice in hearing. Is it not so?</p>
<p>Tell me then about what I should talk to you: about
what matter are you able to listen?&mdash;About good and evil.
&mdash;Good and evil in what? In a horse? No. Well, in an
ox? No. What then? In a man? Yes. Do we know then
what a man is, what the notion is which we have of him,
or have we our ears in any degree practised about this
matter? But do you understand what nature is? or can
you even in any degree understand me when I say, I shall
use demonstration to you? How? Do you understand
his very thing, what demonstration is, or how any thing
i, demonstrated, or by what means; or what things are
<pb n="190"/>
like demonstration, but are not demonstration? Do you
know what is true or what is false? What is consequent
on a thing, what is repugnant to a thing, or not consistent, or in-
consistent?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> But must I excite you to philosophy, and how? Shall I show to you the repugnance in
the opinions of most men, through which they differ about
things good and evil, and about things which are profitable and unprofitable, when you know not this very thing,
what repugnance (contradiction) is? Show me then what
I shall accomplish by discoursing with you: excite my
inclination to do this. As the grass which is suitable,
when it is presented to a sheep, moves its inclination to
eat, but if you present to it a stone or bread, it will not
be moved to eat; so there are in us certain natural inclinations also to speak, when the hearer shall appear to be
somebody, when he himself shall excite us: but when he
shall sit by us like a stone or like grass, how can he excite
a man's desire (to speak)? Does the vine say to the husbandman, Take care of me? No, but the vine by showing
in itself that it will be profitable to the husbandman, if
he does take care of it, invites him to exercise care. When
children are attractive and lively, whom do they not invite
to play with them, and crawl with them, and lisp with
them? But who is eager to play with an ass or to bray
with it? for though it is small, it is still a little ass.</p>
<p>Why then do you say nothing to me? I can only say
this to you, that he who knows not who he is, and for
what purpose he exists, and what is this world, and with
whom he is associated, and what things are the good and
the bad, and the beautiful and the ugly, and who neither
understands discourse nor demonstration, nor what is true
nor what is false, and who is not able to distinguish them,
will neither desire according to nature nor turn away nor
move towards, nor intend (to act), nor assent, nor dissent
nor suspend his judgment: to say all in a few words, he
will go about dumb and blind, thinking that he is somebody, but being nobody. Is this so now for the first time?
Is it not the fact that ever since the human race existed,
all errors and misfortunes have arisen through this igno-
<pb n="191"/>
rance? Why did Agamemnon and Achilles quarrel with
one another? Was it not through not knowing what
things are profitable and not profitable? Does not the
one say it is profitable to restore Chryseis to her father,
and does not the other say that it is not profitable? does
not the one say that he ought to take the prize of another,
and does not the other say that he ought not? Did they
not for these reasons forget, both who they were and for
what purpose they had come there? Oh, man, for what
purpose did you come? to gain mistresses or to fight? To
fight. With whom? the Trojans or the Hellenes? With the
Trojans. Do you then leave <placeName key="tgn,2031054">Hector</placeName> alone and draw your
sword against your own king? And do you, most excellent Sir, neglect the duties of the king, you who are the
people's guardian and have such cares; and are you quarrelling about a little girl with the most warlike of your
allies, whom you ought by every means to take care of and
protect? and do you become worse than (inferior to) a
well behaved priest who treats you these fine gladiators
with all respect? Do you see what kind of things ignorance of what is profitable does?</p>
<p>But I also am rich. Are you then richer than Agamemnon? But I am also handsome. Are you then more
handsome than Achilles? But I have also beautiful hair.
But had not Achilles more beautiful hair and gold coloured? and he did not comb it elegantly nor dress it.
But I am also strong. Can you then lift so great a stone
as <placeName key="tgn,2031054">Hector</placeName> or Ajax? But I am also of noble birth. Are
you the son of a goddess mother? are you the son of a
father sprung from Zeus? What good then do these things
do to him, when he sits and weeps for a girl? But I am an
orator. And was he not? Do you not see how he handled
the most skilful of the Hellenes in oratory, Odysseus and
Phoenix? how he stopped their mouths?<note anchored="yes">In the ninth book of the <placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName>, where Achilles answers the
messengers sent to him by Agamemnon. The reply of Achilles is
a wonderful example of eloquence.</note></p>
<p>This is all that I have to say to you; and I say even
this not willingly. Why? Because you have not roused
me. For what must I look to in order to be roused, as
men who are expert in riding are roused by generous

horses? Must I look to your body? You treat it dis-
gracefully. To your dress? That is luxurious. To your
behaviour, to your look? That is the same as nothing.
When you would listen to a philosopher, do not say to him,

<head>What is the property of error.</head>
<p>EVERY error comprehends contradiction: for since he who
errs does not wish to err, but to be right, it is plain that
he does not do what he wishes. For what does the thief
wish to do? That which is for his own interest.<note anchored="yes">Compare Xenophon, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 3.9.4">Mem. iii. 9. 4</bibl>.</note> If then
the theft is not for his interest, he does not do that which
he wishes. But every rational soul is by nature offended
at contradiction, and so long as it does not understand this
contradiction, it is not hindered from doing contradictory

things: but when it does understand the contradiction,
it must of necessity avoid the contradiction and avoid
it as much as a man must dissent from the false when he
sees that a thing is false; but so long as this falsehood
does not appear to him, he assents to it as to truth.</p>
<p>He then is strong in argument and has the faculty of
exhorting and confuting, who is able to show to each man
the contradiction through which he errs and clearly to prove
how he does not do that which he wishes and does that
which he does not wish. For if any one shall show this, a
man will himself withdraw from that which he does; but
so long as you do not show this, do not be surprised if a
man persists in his practice; for having the appearance of
doing right, he does what he does. For this reason
<placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> also trusting to this power used to say, I am

though he is only one, he is sufficient in the place of all.

<head>Of finery in dress.</head>
<p>A CERTAIN young man a rhetorician came to see Epictetus,
with his hair dressed more carefully than was usual and
his attire in an ornamental style; whereupon Epictetus
said, Tell me if you do not think that some dogs are
beautiful and some horses, and so of all other animals.
I do think so, the youth replied. Are not then some men
also beautiful and others ugly? Certainly. Do we then for
the same reason call each of them in the same kind beau-
tiful, or each beautiful for something peculiar? And you
will judge of this matter thus. Since we see a dog naturally formed for one thing, and a horse for another, and
for another still, as an example, a nightingale, we may
generally and not improperly declare each of them to be-
beautiful then when it is most excellent according to its
nature; but since the nature of each is different, each of
them seems to me to be beautiful in a different way. Is it
not so? He admitted that it was. That then which makes
a dog beautiful, makes a horse ugly; and that which
makes a horse beautiful, makes a dog ugly, if it is true
that their natures are different. It seems to be so. For
I think that what makes a Pancratiast beautiful, makes a.
wrestler to be not good, and a runner to be most ridiculous; and he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon, is very
ugly for wrestling.<note anchored="yes">A Pancratiast is a man who is trained for the Pancratium, that
is, both for boxing and wrestling. The Pentathlon comprised five
exercises, which are expressed by one Greek line,
<lg>
<l>Leaping, running, the quoit, throwing the Javelin, wrestling.</l></lg>
Compare Aristotle, Rhet. i. 5.</note> It is so said he. What then makes
<pb n="196"/>
a man beautiful? Is it that which in its kind makes
both a dog and a horse beautiful? It is, he said. What
then makes a dog beautiful? The possession of the
excellence of a dog. And what makes a horse beautiful?
The possession of the excellence of a horse. What
then makes a man beautiful? Is it not the possession of
the excellence of a man? And do you then, if you
wish to be beautiful, young man, labour at this, the
acquisition of human excellence. But what is this?
Observe whom you yourself praise, when you praise
many persons without partiality: do you praise the
just or the unjust? The just. Whether do you praise
the moderate or the immoderate? The moderate. And
the temperate or the intemperate? The temperate. If
then you make yourself such a person, you will know that
you will make yourself beautiful: but so long as you
neglect these things, you must be ugly (<foreign lang="greek">ai)sxro/n</foreign>) even
though you contrive all you can to appear beautiful.
Further I do not know what to say to you: for if I say
to you what I think, I shall offend you, and you will
perhaps leave the school and not return to it: and if I do
not say what I think, see how I shall be acting, if you
come to me to be improved, and I shall not improve you at
all, and if you come to me as to a philosopher, and I shall
say nothing to you as a philosopher. And how cruel it
is to you to leave you uncorrected. If at any time
afterwards you shall acquire sense, you will with good
reason blame me and say, What did Epictetus observe in
me that when he saw me in such a plight coming to him
in such a scandalous condition, he neglected me and never
said a word? did he so much despair of me? was I not
young? was I not able to listen to reason? and how many
other young men at this age commit many like errors? I

but Polemon was so affected by the words of the excellent teacher
that he came out quite a different man, and ultimately succeeded
Xenocrates in the school of the Academy. See Epict. iv. 11. 30.</note> yet he

what; but you will say when you come to your senses, and

<p>If you bring this charge against me hereafter, what
defence shall I make? Why, shall I say that the man will
not be persuaded by me? Was Laius persuaded by Apollo?
Did he not go away and get drunk and show no care for
the oracle?<note anchored="yes">'Laius consulted the oracle at <placeName key="tgn,2098764">Delphi</placeName> how he should have children.
The oracle told him not to beget children, and even to expose them if
he did. Laius was so foolish as to disobey the god in both respects,
for he begot children and brought them up. He did indeed order his
child Oedipus to be exposed, but the boy was saved and became the
murderer of Laius.</note> Well then for this reason did Apollo refuse
to tell him the truth? I indeed do not know, whether
you will be persuaded by me or not; but Apollo knew
most certainly that Laius would not be persuaded and yet
he spoke. But why did he speak? I say in reply, But why
is he Apollo, and why does he deliver oracles, and why has
he fixed himself in this place as a prophet and source of
truth and for the inhabitants of the world to resort to
him? and why are the words Know yourself written in

he himself says, he never left it. But what does he say
even to his judges? <quote>If you acquit me on these conditions that I no longer do that which I do now, I will not

which signifies, but God through the crow; and if he
signifies any thing through a human voice, will he not
cause the man to say this to you, that you may know the

way, and to others in that way, and concerning the

topics the chief and the most urgent is that which relates
to the affects (<foreign lang="greek">ta\ pa/qh</foreign>, perturbations); for an affect is
produced in no other way than by a failing to obtain that
which a man desires or falling into that which a man
would wish to avoid. This is that which brings in per-
turbations, disorders, bad fortune, misfortunes, sorrows,
lamentations, and envy; that which makes men envious
and jealous; and by these causes we are unable even to
listen to the precepts of reason. The second topic con-
cerns the duties of a man; for I ought not to be free
from affects (<foreign lang="greek">a)paqh=</foreign>) like a statue, but I ought to maintain
the relations (<foreign lang="greek">sxe/seis</foreign>) natural and acquired, as a pious
man, as a son, as a father, as a citizen.</p>
<p>The third topic is that which immediately concerns
those who are making proficiency, that which concerns the
security of the other two, so that not even in sleep any
appearance unexamined may surprise us, nor in intoxica-
tion, nor in melancholy. This, it may be said, is above
our power. But the present philosophers neglecting the
first topic and the second (the affects and duties), employ
themselves on the third, using sophistical arguments
(<foreign lang="greek">metapi/ptontas</foreign>), making conclusions from questioning, em-
ploying hypotheses, lying. For a man must, as it is said,
when employed on these matters, take care that he is not
deceived. Who must? The wise and good man. This
then is all that is wanting to you. Have you successfully
worked out the rest? Are you free from deception in the
matter of money? If you see a beautiful girl, do you resist
the appearance? If your neighbour obtains an estate by
will, are you not vexed? Now is there nothing else
wanting to you except unchangeable firmness of mind
(<foreign lang="greek">a)metaptwsi/a</foreign>)? Wretch, you hear these very things with
fear and anxiety that some person may despise you, and
with inquiries about what any person may say about you.
And if a man come and tell you that in a certain conversa-
tion in which the question was, Who is the best philoso-
pher, a man who was present said that a certain person
was the chief philosopher, your little soul which was only
a finger's length stretches out to two cubits. But if
another who is present says, You are mistaken; it is not
worth while to listen to a certain person, for what does he
<pb n="203"/>
know? he has only the first principles, and no more? then
you are confounded, you grow pale, you cry out immediately,
I will show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher.&mdash;
It is seen by these very things: why do you wish to show
it by others? Do you not know that Diogenes pointed
out one of the sophists in this way by stretching out his
middle finger?<note anchored="yes">To point out a man with the middle finger was a way of showing
the greatest contempt for him.</note> And then when the man was wild with
rage, This, he said, is the certain person: I have pointed
him out to you. For a man is not shown by the finger, as
a stone or a piece of wood; but when any person shows
the man's principles, then he shows him as a man.</p>
<p>Let us look at your principles also. For is it not plain
that you value not at all your own will (<foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>), but
you look externally to things which are independent of
your will? For instance, what will a certain person say?
and what will people think of you? will you be considered
a man of learning; have you read Chrysippus or Antipater?
for if you have read Archedemus<note anchored="yes">As to Archedemus, see ii. 4, 11. '<foreign lang="greek">*ape/xeis a(/panta</foreign>: this expression
is compared by <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName> with Matthew vi. 2, <foreign lang="greek">a)pe/xousi misqo\n</foreign>.</note> also, you have every thing
[that you can desire]. Why are you still uneasy lest you
should not show us who you are? Would you let me tell
you what manner of man you have shown us that you are?
You have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow,
querulous, passionate, cowardly, finding fault with every
thing, blaming every body, never quiet, vain: this is what
you have exhibited to us. Go away now and read Archedemus; then if a mouse should leap down and make a
noise, you are a dead man. For such a death awaits you
as it did<note anchored="yes">Wolf suggests <foreign lang="greek">oi(=os</foreign>. Crinis was a Stoic philosopher mentioned by
Diogenes Laertius. We may suppose that he was no real philosopher,
and that he died of fright.</note>&mdash;what was the man's name?&mdash;Crinis; and he too
was proud, because he understood Archedemus.</p>
<p>Wretch, will you not dismiss these things that do not
concern you at all? These things are suitable to those
who are able to learn them without perturbation, to those
who can say: <quote>I am not subject to anger, to grief, to
envy: I am not hindered, I am not restrained. What
<pb n="204"/>
remains for me? I have leisure, I am tranquil: let us
see how we must deal with sophistical arguments;<note anchored="yes">See this chapter above.</note> let us
see how when a man has accepted an hypothesis he shall
not be led away to any thing absurd.</quote> To them such
things belong. To those who are happy it is appropriate
to light a fire, to dine; if they choose, both to sing and
to dance. But when the vessel is sinking, you come to
me and hoist the sails.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tou\s sifa/rous</foreign>. On this reading the student may consult the note
in Schweighaeuser's edition. The word <foreign lang="greek">sifa/rous</foreign>, if it is the right
reading, is not clear; nor the meaning of this conclusion.
<p>The philosopher is represented as being full of anxiety about things
which do not concern him, and which are proper subjects for those
only who are free from disturbing passions and are quite happy, which i
not the philosopher's condition. He is compared to a sinking ship, and
at this very time he is supposed to be employed in the useless labour
of hoisting the sails.</p></note></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<head>What is the matter on which a good man should be
employed, and in what we ought chiefly to practise
ourselves.</head>
<p>THE material for the wise and good man is his own ruling
faculty: and the body is the material for the physician
and the aliptes (the man who oils persons); the land is
the matter for the husbandman. The business of the wise
and good man is to use appearances conformably to nature:
and as it is the nature of every soul to assent to the truth,
to dissent from the false, and to remain in suspense as to
that which is uncertain; so it is its nature to be moved
towards the desire of the good, and to aversion from the
evil; and with respect to that which is neither good nor
bad it feels indifferent. For as the money-changer (banker)
is not allowed to reject Caesar's coin, nor the seller of herbs,
but if you show the coin, whether he chooses or not, he
must give up what is sold for the coin; so it is also in the
matter of the soul. When the good appears, it immediately
<pb n="205"/>
attracts to itself; the evil repels from itself. But the soul
will never reject the manifest appearance of the good, any
more than persons will reject Caesar's coin. On this
principle depends every movement both of man and God.<note anchored="yes">Comp. i. 19, 11.</note></p>
<p>For this reason the good is preferred to every intimate
relationship (obligation). There is no intimate relationship between me and my father, but there is between me
and the good. Are you so hard-hearted? Yes, for such is
my nature; and this is the coin which God has given me.
For this reason if the good is something different from the
beautiful and the just, both father is gone (neglected), and
brother and country, and every thing. But shall I overlook
my own good, in order that you may have it, and shall I
give it up to you? Why? I am your father. But you are
not my good. I am your brother. But you are not my
good. But if we place the good in a right determination
of the will, the very observance of the relations of life is
good, and accordingly he who gives up any external things,
obtains that which is good. Your father takes away your
property. But he does not injure you. Your brother will
have the greater part of the estate in land. Let him have
as much as he chooses. Will he then have a greater share
of modesty, of fidelity, of brotherly affection? For who will
eject you from this possession? Not even Zeus, for neither
has he chosen to do so; but he has made this in my own
power, and he has given it to me just as he possessed it
himself, free from hindrance, compulsion, and impediment.
When then the coin which another uses is a different coin,
if a man presents this coin, be receives that which is
sold for it. Suppose that there comes into the province a
thievish proconsul, what coin does he use? Silver coin.
Show it to him, and carry off what you please. Suppose
one comes who is an adulterer: what coin does he use?
Little girls. Take, a man says, the coin, and sell me the
small thing. Give, says the seller, and buy [what you want].
Another is eager to possess boys. Give him the coin, and
receive what you wish. Another is fond of hunting: give
him a fine nag or a dog. Though he groans and laments,
be will sell for it that which you want. For another
<pb n="206"/>
compels him from within, he who has fixed determined)
this coin.<note anchored="yes">Mrs. Carter compares the Epistle to the Romans, vii. 21&ndash;23.
Schweighaeuser says, the man either sees that the thing which he is
doing is bad or unjust, or for any other reason he does not do the
thing willingly; but he is compelled, and allows himself to be carried
away by the passion which rules him. The 'another' who compels
is God, Schweig. says, who has made the nature of man such, that
he must postpone every thing else to that thing in which he places
his Good: and he adds, that it is man's fault if he places his good in
that thing, in which God has not placed it.
<p>Some persons will not consider this to be satisfactory. The man is
compelled and allows himself to be carried away,' etc. The notion of
'compulsion' is inconsistent with the exercise of the will. The man is
unlucky. He is like him 'who sees,' as the Latin poet says, 'the
better things and approves of them, but follows the worse.'</p></note></p>
<p>Against (or with respect to) this kind of thing chiefly a
man should exercise himself. As soon as you go out in the
morning, examine every man whom you see, every man
whom you hear; answer as to a question, What have you
seen? A handsome man or woman? Apply the rule. Is
this independent of the will, or dependent? Independent.
Take it away. What have you seen? A man lamenting
over the death of a child. Apply the rule. Death is a
thing independent of the will. Take it away. Has the
proconsul met you? Apply the rule. What kind of thing is
a proconsul's office? Independent of the will, or dependent
on it? Independent. Take this away also: it does not
stand examination: cast it away: it is nothing to you.</p>
<p>If we practised this and exercised ourselves in it daily
from morning to night, something indeed would be done.
But now we are forthwith caught half asleep by every
appearance, and it is only, if ever, that in the school we are
roused a little. Then when we go out, if we see a man
lamenting, we say, He is undone. If we see a consul,
we say, He is happy. If we see an exiled man, we say, He
is miserable. If we see a poor man, we say, He is wretched:
he has nothing to eat.</p>
<p>We ought then to eradicate these bad opinions, and to
this end we should direct all our efforts. For what is
weeping and lamenting? Opinion. What is bad fortune?
Opinion. What is civil sedition, what is divided opinion,
what is blame, what is accusation, what is impiety, what is
<pb n="207"/>
trifling?. All these things are opinions, and nothing more,
and opinions about things independent of the will, as if they
were good and bad. Let a man transfer these opinions to
things dependent on the will, and I engage for him that he
will be firm and constant, whatever may be the state of
things around him. Such as is a dish of water, such is the
soul. Such as is the ray of light which falls on the water,
such are the appearances. When the water is moved, the
ray also seems to be moved, yet it is not moved. And when
then a man is seized with giddiness, it is not the arts and
the virtues which are confounded, but the spirit (the
nervous power) on which they are impressed; but if the
spirit be restored to its settled state, those things also are
restored.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note on this obscure passage.</note></p></div2>

<head>Against a person who showed his partizanship in an
unseemly way in a theatre.</head>
<p>THE governor of <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> having shown his favour to an
actor in an unseemly way and being publicly blamed on
this account, and afterwards having reported to Epictetus
that he was blamed and that he was vexed at those who
blamed him, Epictetus said, What harm have they been
doing? These men also were acting as partizans, as you
were doing. The governor replied, Does then any person
show his partizanship in this way? When they see you,
said Epictetus, who are their governor, a friend of Caesar
and his deputy, showing partizanship in this way, was it
not to be expected that they also should show their partizanship in the same way? for if it is not right to show
partizanship in this way, do not do so yourself; and if it is
right, why are you angry if they followed your example?
For whom have the many to imitate except you, who are
their superiors? to whose example should they look when
<pb n="208"/>
they go to the theatre except yours? See bow the deputy
of Caesar looks on: he has cried out, and I too then will
cry out. He springs up from his seat, and I will spring
up. His slaves sit in various parts of the theatre and call
out. I have no slaves, but I will myself cry out as much as
I can and as loud as all of them together. You ought then
to know when you enter the theatre that you enter as a
rule and example to the rest how they ought to look at
the acting. Why then did they blame you? Because
every man hates that which is a hindrance to him. They
wished one person to be crowned; you wished another.
They were a hindrance to you, and you were a hindrance
to them. You were found to be the stronger; and they
did what they could; they blamed that which hindered
them. What then would you have? That you should do
what you please, and they should not even say what they
please? And what is the wonder? Do not the husband-
men abuse Zeus when they are hindered by him? do not
the sailors abuse him? do they ever cease abusing Caesar?
What then? does not Zeus know? is not what is said
reported to Caesar? What then does he do? he knows
that, if he punished all who abuse him, he would have
nobody to rule over. What then? when you enter the
theatre, you ought to say not, Let Sophron (some actor) be
crowned, but you ought to say this, Come let me maintain
my will in this matter so that it shall be conformable to
nature: no man is dearer to me than myself. It would be
ridiculous then for me to be hurt (injured) in order that
another who is an actor may be crowned. Whom then do
I wish to gain the prize? Why the actor who does gain
the prize; and so he will always gain the prize whom I
wish to gain it.&mdash;But I wish Sophron to be crowned.&mdash;
Celebrate as many games as you choose in your own house,
Nemean, Pythian, Isthmian, Olympian, and proclaim him
victor. But in public do not claim more than your due,
nor attempt to appropriate to yourself what belongs to all.
If you do not consent to this, bear being abused: for when
you do the same as the many, you put yourself on the
same level with them.

<head>Against those who on account of sickness go away
home.</head>
<p>I AM sick here, said one of the pupils, and I wish to return
home.&mdash;At home, I suppose, you were free from sickness.
Do you not consider whether you are doing any thing here
which may be useful to the exercise of your will, that it
may be corrected? For if you are doing nothing towards
this end, it was to no purpose that you came. Go away.
Look after your affairs at home. For if your ruling power
cannot be maintained in a state conformable to nature, it
is possible that your land can, that you will be able to
increase your money, you will take care of your father in
his old age, frequent the public place, hold magisterial
office: being bad you will do badly any thing else that you
have to do. But if you understand yourself, and know
that you are casting away certain bad opinions and adopting
others in their place, and if you have changed your state of
life from things which are not within your will to things
which are within your will, and if you ever say, Alas! you
are not saying what you say on account of your father, or
your brother, but on account of yourself, do you still allege
your sickness? Do you not know that both disease and
death must surprise us while we are doing something?
the husbandman while he is tilling the ground, the sailor
while he is on his voyage? what would you be doing when
death surprises you, for you must be surprised when you
are doing something? If you can be doing anything better
than this when you are surprised, do it. For I wish to be
surprised by disease or death when I am looking after
nothing else than my own will, that I may be free from
perturbation, that I may be free from hindrance, free from
compulsion, and in a state of liberty. I wish to be found
practising these things that I may be able to say to God,
Have I in any respect transgressed thy commands? have I
in any respect wrongly used the powers which thou gavest
me? have I misused my perceptions or my preconceptions
<pb n="210"/>
(<foreign lang="greek">prolh/yesi</foreign>)?<note anchored="yes">On 'preconceptions,' see i. 2.</note> have I ever blamed thee? have I ever found
fault with thy administration? I have been sick, because
it was thy will, and so have others, but I was content to
be sick. I have been poor because it was thy will, but I
was content also. I have not filled a magisterial office,
because it was not thy pleasure that I should: I have
never desired it Hast thou ever seen me for this reason
discontented? have I not always approached thee with a
cheerful countenance, ready to do thy commands and to
obey thy signals? Is it now thy will that I should depart
from the assemblage of men? I depart. I give thee all
thanks that thou hast allowed me to join in this thy
assemblage of men and to see thy works, and to comprehend
this thy administration. May death surprise me while I
am thinking of these things, while I am thus writing and
reading.</p>
<p>But my mother will not hold my head when I am sick.
Go to your mother then; for you are a fit person to have
your head held when you are sick.&mdash;But at home I used to
lie down on a delicious bed.&mdash;Go away to your bed: indeed
you are fit to lie on such a bed even when you are in

words, he only gives the meaning. Antoninus (viii. 43) says, 'Different things delight different people. But it is my delight to keep the
ruling faculty sound without turning away either from any man or
from any of the things which happen to men, but looking at and
receiving all with welcome eyes, and using every thing according to
its value.'</note> As one man, he says, is
pleased with improving his land, another with improving
his horse, so I am daily pleased in observing that I am
growing better. Better in what? in using nice little
words? Man, do not say that. In little matters of specu-
lation (<foreign lang="greek">qewrh/mata</foreign>)? what are you saying?&mdash;And indeed I
do not see what else there is on which philosophers employ
their time.&mdash;Does it seem nothing to you to have never
found fault with any person, neither with God nor man? to
have blamed nobody? to carry the same face always in going
out and coming in? This is what <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> knew, and yet

But if any man asked for nice little words or little speculations, he would carry him to Protagoras or to Hippias;

<head>Miscellaneous.</head>
<p>WHEN some person asked him how it happened that since
reason has been more cultivated by the men of the present
age, the progress made in former times was greater. In
what respect, he answered, has it been more cultivated
now, and in what respect was the progress greater then?
For in that in which it has now been more cultivated, in
that also the progress will now be found. At present it
has been cultivated for the purpose of resolving syllogisms,
and progress is made. But in former times it was culti-
vated for the purpose of maintaining the governing faculty
in a condition conformable to nature, and progress was
made. Do not then mix things which are different, and
do not expect, when you are labouring at one thing to
make progress in another. But see if any man among us
when he is intent upon this, the keeping himself in a state
<pb n="212"/>
conformable to nature and living so always, does not make
progress. For you will not find such a man.</p>
<p>The good man is invincible, for he does not enter the
contest where he is not stronger. If you (his adversary)
want to have his land and all that is on it, take the land;
take his slaves, take his magisterial office, take his poor
body. But you will not make his desire fail in that which
it seeks, nor his aversion fall into that which he would
avoid. The only contest into which he enters is that about
things which are within the power of his will; how then
will he not be invincible?</p>
<p>Some person having asked him what is Common sense,
Epictetus replied, As that may be called a certain Common
hearing which only distinguishes vocal sounds, and that
which distinguishes musical sounds is not Common, but
artificial; so there are certain things which men, who are
not altogether perverted, see by the common notions which
all possess. Such a constitution of the mind is named
Common sense.<note anchored="yes">The Greek is <foreign lang="greek">koi/nos nou=s</foreign>, the Communis sensus of the Romans, and
our Common sense. Horace (<bibl n="Hor. S. 1.3.65">Sat. i. 3, 65</bibl>) speaks of a man who <quote lang="la">'communi sensu plane caret,'</quote>

who have a good natural disposition, even if you try to

Rufus<note anchored="yes">Rufus is mentioned i. 1, note 12.</note> generally attempted to discourage (his pupils), and
he used this method as a test of those who had a good
natural disposition and those who had not. For it was his
habit to say, as a stone, if you cast it upwards, will be

whose mind is naturally good, the more you repel him,
the more he turns towards that to which he is naturally

<head>To the administrator of the free cities who was an
Epicurean.</head>
<p>WHEN the administrator<note anchored="yes">The Greek is <foreign lang="greek">diorqwth/s</foreign>. The Latin word is Corrector, which
occurs in inscriptions, and elsewhere.</note> came to visit him, and the man
was an Epicurean, Epictetus said, It is proper for us who
are not philosophers to inquire of you who are philoso-
phers,<note anchored="yes">The Epicureans are ironically named Philosophers, for most of
them were arrogant men. See what is said of them in Cicero's De
Natura Deorum, i. 8. Schweig.</note> as those who come to a strange city inquire of the
citizens and those who are acquainted with it, what is
the best thing in the world, in order that we also after
inquiry may go in quest of that which is best and look
at it, as strangers do with the things in cities. For
that there are three things which relate to man, soul,
body, and things external, scarcely any man denies. It
remains for you philosophers to answer what is the
best. What shall we say to men? Is the flesh the best?
and was it for this that Maximus<note anchored="yes">Maximus was appointed by Trajan to conduct a campaign against
the Parthians, in which he lost his life. Dion Cassius, ii. <date value="1108">1108</date>, <date value="1126">1126</date>,
Beimarus.
<p>Cassiope or Cassope is a city in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, near the sea, and between
<placeName key="perseus,Pandosia">Pandosia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName>, where Epictetus lived.</p></note> sailed as far as Cassiope in winter (or bad weather) with his son, and accompanied him that he might be gratified in the flesh?
When the man said that it was not, and added, Far be
that from him.&mdash;Is it not fit then, Epictetus said, to
be actively employed about the best? It is certainly of
all things the most fit. What then do we possess which
is better than the flesh? The soul, he replied. And the
good things of the best, are they better, or the good things
of the worse? The good things of the best. And are the
good things of the best within the power of the will
or not within the power of the will? They are within
the power of the will. Is then the pleasure of the soul
a thing within the power of the will? It is, he replied.
<pb n="214"/>
And on what shall this pleasure depend? On itself? But
that can not be conceived: for there must first exist a
certain substance or nature (<foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>) of good, by obtaining
which we shall have pleasure in the soul. He assented to
this also. On what then shall we depend for this pleasure
of the soul? for if it shall depend on things of the soul,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">yuxikoi=s</foreign> is Lord Shaftesbury's emendation in place of <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqoi=s</foreign>, and
it is accepted by Schweighaeuser.</note>
the substance (nature) of the good is discovered; for good
can not be one thing, and that at which we are rationally
delighted another thing; nor if that which precedes is not
good, can that which comes after be good, for in order that
the thing which comes after may be good, that which
precedes must be good. But you would not affirm this.
if you are in your right mind, for you would then say
what is inconsistent both with Epicurus and the rest of
your doctrines. It remains then that the pleasure of the
soul is in the pleasure from things of the body: and again
that those bodily things must be the things which precede
and the substance (nature) of the good.</p>
<p>For this reason Maximus acted foolishly if he made the
voyage for any other reason than for the sake of the flesh,
that is, for the sake of the best. And also a man acts
foolishly if he abstains from that which belongs to others,
when he is a judge (<foreign lang="greek">dikasth/s</foreign>) and able to take it. But,
if you please, let us consider this only, how this thing may
be done secretly, and safely, and so that no man will know
it. For not even does Epicurus himself declare stealing to
be bad,<note anchored="yes">Diogenes Laertius (x. 151), quoted by <placeName key="tgn,1030954">Upton</placeName>. 'Injustice,' says
Epicurus, 'is not an evil in itself, but the evil is in the fear which there
is on account of suspicion.'</note> but he admits that detection is; and because it
is impossible to have security against detection, for this

stealing is done cleverly and cautiously, we shall not be

impossible to assent to that which appears false, and to
turn away from that which is true, so it is impossible
to abstain from that which appears good. But wealth is
a good thing, and certainly most efficient in producing
pleasure. Why will you not acquire wealth? And why
should we not corrupt our neighbor's wife, if we can do
it without detection? and if the husband foolishly prates
about the matter, why not pitch him out of the house? If
you would be a philosopher such as you ought to be, if a
perfect philosopher, if consistent with your own doctrines,
[you must act thus]. If you would not, you will not
differ at all from us who are called Stoics; for we also say

public affairs were Epicurean doctrines. See Epictetus, i. 23, 3 and 6</note> are you thinking of a city of Epicureans? [One man says], '1 do not marry.'&mdash;'Nor I, for
a man ought not to marry; nor ought we to beget children,
nor engage in public matters.' What then will happen?
whence will the citizens come? who will bring them up?
who will be governor of the youth, who preside over gymnastic exercises? and in what also will the teacher instruct
them? will he teach them what the Lacedaemonians were
taught, or what the Athenians were taught? Come take a
young man, bring him up according to your doctrines. The
doctrines are bad, subversive of a state, pernicious to
families, and not becoming to women. Dismiss them, man.
You live in a chief city: it is your duty to be a magistrate,
to judge justly, to abstain from that which belongs to others;
no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your own

wife, and no youth, no vessel of silver, no vessel of gold
(except your own). Seek for doctrines which are consistent
with what I say, and by making them your guide you will
with pleasure abstain from things which have such per-
suasive power to lead us and overpower us. But if to the
persuasive power of these things, we also devise such a
philosophy as this which helps to push us on towards them
and strengthens us to this end, what will be the cones-
quence? In a piece of toreutic<note anchored="yes">The toreutic art is the art of working in metal, stone, or wood, and
of making figures on them in relief or by cutting into the material.</note> art which is the best part?
the silver or the workmanship? The substance of the hand
is the flesh; but the work of the hand is the principal
part (that which precedes and leads the rest). The duties
then are also three:<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> those which are directed towards the
existence of a thing; those which are directed towards its
existence in a particular kind; and third, the chief or
leading things themselves. So also in man we ought not
to value the material, the poor flesh, but the principal
(leading things, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ prohgou/mena</foreign>). What are these? Engaging
in public business, marrying, begetting children, venerat-
ing God, taking care of parents, and generally, having
desires, aversions (<foreign lang="greek">e)kkli/nein</foreign>), pursuits of things and avoid-
ances, in the way in which we ought to do these things,
and according to our nature. And how are we constituted
by nature? Free, noble, modest: for what other animal
blushes? what other is capable of receiving the appearance
(the impression) of shame? and we are so constituted by
nature as to subject pleasure to these things, as a minister,
a servant, in order that it may call forth our activity, in
order that it may keep us constant in acts which are
conformable to nature.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note></p>

know? Caesar wrote to me a codicil.<note anchored="yes">A 'codicillus' is a small 'codex' and the original sense of 'codex'
is a strong stem or stump. Lastly it was used for a book, and even for
a will. 'Codicilli' were small writing-tablets, covered with wax, on
which men wrote with a stylus or pointed metal. Lastly, codicillus is
a book or writing generally; and a writing or letter by which the
emperor conferred any office. Our word codicil has only one sense,
which is a small writing added or subjoined to a will or testament; but
this sense is also derived from the Roman use of the word. (Dig. 29,

here, and that the meaning is this: He who before daybreak is waiting at the door of a rich man, whose favour he seeks, is said in a
derisive way to be passing the night before a man's chamber.</note>
To whom have you sent gifts? Then do you not see that
to be a judge is just of the same value as Numenius is?
But I can throw into prison any man whom I please.&mdash;
So you can do with a stone.&mdash;But I can beat with sticks
whom I please.&mdash;So you may an ass. This is not a
governing of men. Govern us as rational animals: show
us what is profitable to us, and we will follow it: show us
what is unprofitable, and we will turn away from it.
Make us imitators of yourself, as Socrates made men imitators of himself. For he was like a governor of men, who
made them subject to him their desires, their aversion, their
movements towards an object and their turning away from
it.&mdash;Do this: do not do this: if you do not obey, I will
throw you into prison.&mdash;This is not governing men like
rational animals. But I (say): As Zeus has ordained, so
act: if you do not act so, you will feel the penalty, you will
be punished.&mdash;What will be the punishment? Nothing
else than not having done your duty: you will lose the
character of fidelity, modesty, propriety. Do not look for
greater penalties than these.

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<head>To a certain rhetorician who was going up to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on
a suit.</head>
<p>WHEN a certain person came to him, who was going up to
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on account of a suit which had regard to his rank,
Epictetus enquired the reason of his going to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and
the man then asked what he thought about the matter.
Epictetus replied, If you ask me what you will do in
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, whether you will succeed or fail, I have no rule
(<foreign lang="greek">qew/rhma</foreign>) about this. But if you ask me how you will
fare, I can tell you: if you have right opinions (<foreign lang="greek">do/gmata</foreign>),
you will fare well; if they are false, you will fare ill.
For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion. For
what is the reason why you desired to be elected governor
of the Cnossians? Your opinion. What is the reason
that you are now going up to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>? Your opinion. And
going in winter, and with danger and expense.&mdash;I must
go.&mdash;What tells you this? Your opinion. Then if opi-
nions are the causes of all actions, and a man has bad
opinions, such as the cause may be, such also is the effect.
Have we then all sound opinions, both you and your
adversary? And how do you differ? But have you
sounder opinions than your adversary? Why? You
think so. And so does he think that his opinions are
better; and so do madmen. This is a bad criterion.
But show to me that you have made some inquiry
into your opinions and have taken some pains about
them. And as now you are sailing to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in order
to become governor of the Cnossians, and you are not
content to stay at home with the honours which you had,
but you desire something greater and more conspicuous,
so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose
of examining your own opinions, and casting them out, if
you have any that are bad? Whom have you approached
for this purpose? What time have you fixed for it? What
age? Go over the times of your life by yourself, if you
are ashamed of me (knowing the fact) when you were a
boy, did you examine your own opinions? and did you not
<pb n="220"/>
then, as you do all things now, do as you did do? and
when you were become a youth and attended the rheto-
ricians, and yourself practised rhetoric, what did you imagine
that you were deficient in? And when you were a young
man and engaged in public matters, and pleaded causes
yourself, and were gaining reputation, who then seemed
your equal? And when would you have submitted to any
man examining and showing that your opinions are bad?
What then do you wish me to say to you?&mdash;Help me in
this matter.&mdash;I have no theorem (rule) for this. Nor have
you, if you came to me for this purpose, come to me as a
philosopher, but as to a seller of vegetables or a shoemaker.
For what purpose then have philosopher' theorems? For
this purpose, that whatever may happen, our ruling faculty
may be and continue to be conformable to nature. Does
this seem to you a small thing?&mdash;No; but the greatest.
&mdash;What then? does it need only a short time? and is it
possible to seize it as you pass by? If you can, seize it.</p>
<p>Then you will say, I met with Epictetus as I should
meet with a stone or a statue: for you saw me, and nothing
snore. But he meets with a man as a man, who learns his
opinions, and in his turn shows his own. Learn my
opinions: show me yours; and then say that you have
visited me. Let us examine one another: if I have any
bad opinion, take it away: if you have any, show it. This
is the meaning of meeting with a philosopher.&mdash;Not so,
(you say): but this is only a passing visit, and while we
are hiring the vessel, we can also see Epictetus. Let us
see what he says. Then you go away and say: Epictetus
was nothing; he used solecisms and spoke in a barbarous
way. For of what else do you come as judges?&mdash;Well,
but a man may say to me, if I attend to such matters<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> (as
you do), I shall have no land, as you have none; I shall
have no silver cups as you have none, nor fine beasts as
you have none.&mdash;In answer to this it is perhaps sufficient
to say: I have no need of such things: but if you possess
many things, you have need of others: whether you
choose or not, you are poorer than I am. What then have
I need of? Of that which you have not: of firmness, of a
<pb n="221"/>
mind which is conformable to nature, of being free from
perturbation. Whether I have a patron<note anchored="yes">The Roman word 'patronus,' which at that time had the sense of
a protector.</note> or not, what is
that to me? but it is something to you. I am richer than
you: I am not anxious what Caesar will think of me: for
this reason, I flatter no man. This is what I possess
instead of vessels of silver and gold. You have utensils
of gold; but your discourse, your opinions, your assents,
your movements (pursuits), your desires are of earthen
ware. But when I have these things conformable to
nature, why should I not employ my studies also upon
reason? for I have leisure: my mind is not distracted.
What shall I do, since I have no distraction? What more
suitable to a man have I than this? When you have
nothing to do, you are disturbed, you go to the theatre or
you wander about without a purpose. Why should not
the philosopher labour to improve his reason? You
employ yourself about crystal vessels: I employ myself
about the syllogism named the lying:<note anchored="yes">On the syllogism named 'lying' (<foreign lang="greek">yeudo/menos</foreign>) see Epict. ii. 17. 34.</note> you about

named the denying (<foreign lang="greek">tou= a)pofa/skontos</foreign>). To you every
thing appears small that you possess: to me all that I
have appears great. Your desire is insatiable: mine is
satisfied. To (children) who put their hand into a narrow-
necked earthen vessel and bring out figs and nuts, this
happens; if they fill the hand, they cannot take it out,
and then they cry. Drop a few of them and you will
draw things out. And do you part with your desires:
do not desire many things and you will have what you
want.

that you have eaten what you ought, that you have been

for action comes? Now is the time for the fever. Let it
be borne well. Now is the time for thirst, bear it well;
now is the time for hunger, bear it well. Is it not in your
power? who shall hinder you? The physician will hinder
you from drinking; but he cannot prevent you from
bearing thirst well: and he will hinder you from eating;
but he cannot prevent you from bearing hunger well.</p>
<p>But I cannot attend to my philosophical studies.<note anchored="yes">The Greek is <foreign lang="greek">ou) filologw=</foreign>. See Schweighaeuser's note.</note> And
for what purpose do you follow them? Slave, is it not
that you may be happy, that you may be constant, is it
not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and
live so? What hinders you when you have a fever from
having your ruling faculty conformable to nature? Here
is the proof of the thing, here is the test of the philosopher.
For this also is a part of life, like walking, like sailing,
like journeying by land, so also is fever. Do you read
when you are walking? No. Nor do you when you have
a fever. But if you walk about well, you have all that
belongs to a man who walks. If you bear a fever well,
you have all that belongs to a man in a fever. What is
it to bear a fever well? Not to blame God or man; not to
be afflicted at that which happens, to expect death well
and nobly, to do what must be done: when the physician
comes in, not to be frightened at what he says; nor if he
says, 'you are doing well,'<note anchored="yes">See ii 18, 14.</note> to be overjoyed. For what
good has he told you? and when you were in health,
what good was that to you? And even if he says, 'you
<pb n="224"/>
are in a bad way,' do not despond. For what is it to be
ill? is it that you are near the severance of the soul and
the body? what harm is there in this? If you are not
near now, will you not afterwards be near? Is the world
going to be turned upside down when you are dead?
Why then do you flatter the physician?<note anchored="yes">Et quid opus Cratero magnos promittere montes? Persius, iii. 65.

physician, as you do a shoemaker when he is measuring

and so treat the physician as to the body which is not
yours, but by nature dead? He who has a fever has an
opportunity of doing this: if he does these things, he has
what belongs to him. For it is not the business of a
philosopher to look after these externals, neither his wine
nor his oil nor his poor body, but his own ruling power.
But as to externals how must he act? so far as not to be
careless about them. Where then is there reason for fear?
where is there then still reason for anger, and of fear about
what belongs to others, about things which are of no value?

<p>WE ought not to make our exercises consist in means

differ at all from jugglers. For it is difficult even to

By no means. Every thing which is difficult and dangerous is not suitable for practice; but that is suitable
which conduces to the working out of that which is proposed to us. And what is that which is proposed to
us as a thing to be worked out? To live with desire
and aversion (avoidance of certain things) free from restraint. And what is this? Neither to be disappointed in
that which you desire, nor to fall into any thing which
you would avoid. Towards this object then exercise
(practice) ought to tend. For since it is not possible to
have your desire not disappointed and your aversion free
from falling into that which you would avoid, without
great and constant practice, you must know that if you
allow your desire and aversion to turn to things which
are not within the power of the will, you will neither
have your desire capable of attaining your object, nor
your aversion free from the power of avoiding that which
you would avoid. And since strong habit leads (prevails),
and we are accustomed to employ desire and aversion only
to things which are not within the power of our will, we
ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit, and where
there is great slipperiness in the appearances, there to
oppose the habit of exercise.</p>
<p>I am rather inclined to pleasure: I will incline to the
contrary side<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)natoixh/sw</foreign>. See the note of Schweighaeuser.</note> above measure for the sake of exercise. I
<pb n="227"/>
am averse to pain: I will rub and exercise against this
the appearances which are presented to me for the purpose
of withdrawing my aversion from every such thing. For
who is a practitioner in exercise? He who practises not
using his desire, and applies his aversion only to things
which are within the power of his will, and practises
most in the things which are difficult to conquer. For
this reason one man must practise himself more against
one thing and another against another thing. What then
is it to the purpose to set up a palm tree, or to carry about
a tent of skins, or a mortar and pestle?<note anchored="yes">This was done for the sake of exercise says <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>; but I don't
understand the passage.</note> Practise, man,
if you are irritable, to endure if you are abused, not
to be vexed if you are treated with dishonour. Then you
will make so much progress that, even if a man strikes you
you will say to yourself, Imagine that you have embraced
a statue: then also exercise yourself to use wine properly
so as not to drink much, for in this also there are men
who foolishly practise themselves; but first of all you
should abstain from it, and abstain from a young girl and
dainty cakes. Then at last, if occasion presents itself, for
the purpose of trying yourself at a proper time you will
descend into the arena to know if appearances overpower
you as they did formerly. But at first fly far from that
which is stronger than yourself: the contest is unequal
between a charming young girl and a beginner in philosophy. The earthen pitcher, as the saying is, and the
rock do not agree.<note anchored="yes">There is a like fable in Aesop of the earthen pitcher and the

<p>After the desire and the aversion comes the second topic

assents, which is related to the things which are persuasive and attractive. For as <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> said, we ought not
<pb n="228"/>
to live a life without examination,<note anchored="yes">See i. 26, 18, and iii. 2, 5.</note> so we ought not to
accept an appearance without examination, but we should
say, Wait, let me see what you are and whence you come;
like the watch at night (who says) Show me the pass
(the Roman tessera).<note anchored="yes">Polybius vi. 36.</note> Have you the signal from nature
which the appearance that may be accepted ought to
have? And finally whatever means are applied to the
body by those who exercise it, if they tend in any way
towards desire and aversion, they also may be fit means
of exercise; but if they are for display, they are the indications of one who has turned himself towards something
external and who is hunting for something else and who
looks for spectators who will say, Oh the great man. For
this reason Apollonius said well, When you intend to
exercise yourself for your own advantage, and you are
thirsty from heat, take in a mouthful of cold water, and
spit it out and tell nobody.<note anchored="yes">Schweighaeuser refers to Arrian's Expedition of Alexander (vi.

<head>What solitude is, and what kind of person a solitary
man is.</head>
<p>SOLITUDE is a certain condition of a helpless man. For
because a man is alone, he is not for that reason also soli-
tary; just as though a man is among numbers, he is not
therefore not solitary. When then we have lost either a
brother, or a son or a friend on whom we were accustomed
to repose, we say that we are left solitary, though we are
often in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, though such a crowd meet us, though so
many live in the same place, and sometimes we have a
great number of slaves. For the man who is solitary, as
<pb n="229"/>
It is conceived, is considered to be a helpless person and
exposed to those who wish to harm him. For this reason
when we travel, then especially do we say that we are
lonely when we fall among robbers, for it is not the sight
of a human creature which removes us from solitude, but
the sight of one who is faithful and modest and helpful
to us. For if being alone is enough to make solitude, you
may say that even Zeus is solitary in the conflagration<note anchored="yes">This was the doctrine of Heraclitus 'that all things were com-
posed from (had their origin in) fire, and were resolved into it,' an
opinion afterwards adopted by the Stoics. It is not so extravagant, as
it may appear to some persons, to suppose that the earth had a
beginning, is in a state of continual change, and will finally be
destroyed in some way, and have a new beginning. See <placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName>,
Ep. 9 'cum resolute mundo, diis in unum confusis, paulisper oessante
natura, adquiescit sibi <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>, cogitationibus suis traditus.'</note>
and bewails himself saying, Unhappy that I am who have
neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son,
nor descendant nor kinsman. This is what some say that
he does when he is alone at the conflagration.<note anchored="yes">The Latin translation is: 'hoe etiam nonnulli facturum eum in
conflagratione mundi . . . . aiunt.' But the word is <foreign lang="greek">poiei=</foreign>; and this
may mean that the conflagration has happened, and will happen
again. The Greek philosophers in their speculations were not troubled
with the consideration of time. Even Herodotus (ii. 11), in his speculations on the gulf, which he supposes that the Nile valley was once,
speaks of the possibility of it being filled up in 20,000 years, or less.
Modern speculators have only recently become bold enough to throw
aside the notion of the earth and the other bodies in space being
limited by time, as the ignorant have conceived it.</note> For they
do not understand how a man passes his life when he is
alone, because they set out from a certain natural principle, from the natural desire of community and mutual
love and from the pleasure of conversation among men.
But none the less a man ought to be prepared in a manner
for this also (being alone), to be able to be sufficient for
himself and to be his own companion. For as Zeus dwells
with himself, and is tranquil by himself, and thinks of his
own administration and of its nature, and is employed in
thoughts suitable to himself; so ought we also to be able
to talk with ourselves, not to feel the want of others also,
not to be unprovided with the means of passing our time;
to observe the divine administration, and the relation of
<pb n="230"/>
ourselves to every thing else; to consider how we for-
merly were affected towards things that happen and how
at present; what are still the things which give us pain;
how these also can be cured and how removed; if any
things require improvement, to improve them according
to reason.</p>
<p>For you see that Caesar appears to furnish us with great
peace, that there are no longer enemies nor battles nor
great associations of robbers nor of 'pirates, but we can
travel at every hour and sail from east to west. But can
Caesar give us security from fever also, can he from ship-
wreck, from fire, from earthquake or from lightning? well,
I will say, can he give us security against love? He cannot.
From sorrow? He cannot. From envy? He cannot. In a
word then he cannot protect us from any of these things.
But the doctrine of philosophers promises to give us
security (peace) even against these things. And what
does it say? Men, if you will attend to me, wherever you
are, whatever you are doing, you will not feel sorrow, nor
anger, nor compulsion, nor hindrance, but you will pass
your time without perturbations and free from every thing.
When a man has this peace, not proclaimed by Caesar, (for
how should he be able to proclaim it?), but by God through
reason, is he not content when he is alone? when he sees
and reflects, Now no evil can happen to me; for me there
is no robber, no earthquake, every thing is full of peace,
full of tranquillity: every way, every city, every meeting,
neighbour, companion is harmless. One person whose
business it is, supplies me with food;<note anchored="yes">See iii. 1, 43.</note> another with
raiment; another with perceptions, and preconceptions
(<foreign lang="greek">prolh/yeis</foreign>). And if he does not supply what is necessary,
he (God) gives the signal for retreat, opens the door, and
says to you, Go. Go whither? To nothing terrible, but to
the place from which you came, to your friends and kins-
men, to the elements:<note anchored="yes">What a melancholy description of death and how gloomy the
ideas in this <hi rend="ital">consolatory</hi> chapter! All beings reduced to mere
elements in successive conflagrations! A noble contrast to the Stoic
notions on this subject may be produced from several passages in the
Scripture&mdash;<quote>Then shall the dust return to the earth, as it was; and the spirit shall return to God who gave it,</quote> Eecles. xii. 7.' Mrs.

I have translated the words of Epictetus <foreign lang="greek">o(/son pneumati/ou, ei)s pneuma/tion</foreign> by 'of air (spirit), to air': but the <foreign lang="greek">pneuma/tion</foreign> of Epictetus
may mean the same as the <foreign lang="greek">pneu=ma</foreign> of Epicharmus, and the same as
the 'spirit' of Ecclesiastes.
<p>An English commentator says that <quote>the doctrine of a future retribution forms the great basis and the leading truth of this book
(Ecclesiastes),</quote> and that <quote>the royal Preacher (Ecclesiastes) brings forward the prospect of a future life and retribution.</quote> I cannot discover
any evidence of this assertion in the book. The conclusion is the best
part of this ill-connected, obscure and confused book, as it appears in
our translation. The conclusion is (xii. 13, 14): 'Fear God and keep
his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man, for God shall
bring every work into judgment with every secret thing, whether it be
good or whether it be evil.' This is all that I can discover in the book
which can support the commentator's statement; and even this may
not mean what he affirms.</p>
<p>Schweighaeuser observes that here was the opportunity for Epictetus
to say something of the immortality of the soul, if he had any thing
to say. But he says nothing unless he means to say that the soul, the
spirit, <quote>returns to God who gave it</quote> as the Preacher says. There is
a passage (iii. 24, 94) which appears to mean that the soul of man
after death will be changed into something else, which the universe
will require for some use or purpose. It is strange, observes Schweig.,
that Epictetus, who studied the philosophy of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, and speaks so
eloquently of man's capacity and his duty to God, should say no
more: but the explanation may be that he had no doctrine of man's
immortality, in the sense in which that word is now used.</p>

When a man has such things to think on, and sees the sun,

and build something else, and so they never want the means
of passing the time. Shall I then, if you sail away, sit
down and weep, because I have been left alone and solitary?
Shall I then have no shells, no ashes? But children do
what they do through want of thought (or deficiency in
knowledge), and we through knowledge are unhappy.</p>

<p>When a man drinks water, or does anything for the

opportunity he tells it to all: 'I drink water.' Is it for
this that you drink water, for the purpose of drinking

not, you are acting ridiculously. But if it is good for you
and you do drink, say nothing about it to those who are

confutation; and <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> was the first who practised this.
And (to know) that the thing is not impossible inquire

you do not reckon them, observe you will behave like
children who at one time play as wrestlers, then as
gladiators, then blow a trumpet, then act a tragedy, when
they have seen and admired such things. So you also do:
you are at one time a wrestler (athlete), then a gladiator,
then a philosopher, then a rhetorician; but with your
whole soul you are nothing: like the ape you imitate all

you have never undertaken any thing after consideration,

<p>Man, consider first what the matter is (which you pro-

thighs, your loins: for different men are naturally formed
for different things. Do you think that, if you do (what
<pb n="236"/>
you are doing daily), you can be a philosopher? Do you
think that you can eat as you do now, drink as you do
now, and in the same way be angry and out of humour?
You must watch, labour, conquer certain desires, you must
depart from your kinsmen, be despised by your slave,
laughed at by those who meet you, in every thing you
must be in an inferior condition, as to magisterial office, in
honours, in courts of justice. When you have considered
all these things completely, then, if you think proper,
approach to philosophy, if you would gain in exchange
for these things freedom from perturbations, liberty, tran-
quillity. If you have not considered these things, do not
approach philosophy: do not act like children, at one time
a philosopher, then a tax collector, then a rhetorician, then
a procurator (officer) of Caesar. These things are not
consistent. You must be one man either good or bad:
you must either labour at your own ruling faculty or at

<head>That we ought with caution to enter into familiar
intercourse with men.</head>
<p>IF a man has frequent intercourse with others either for
talk, or drinking together, or generally for social purposes,
he must either become like them, or change them to his
<pb n="237"/>
own fashion. For if a man places a piece of quenched
charcoal close to a piece that is burning, either the
quenched charcoal will quench the other, or the burning
charcoal will light that which is quenched. Since then
the danger is so great, we must cautiously enter into
such intimacies with those of the common sort, and
remember that it is impossible that a man can keep com-
pany with one who is covered with soot without being
partaker of the soot himself. For what will you do
f a man speaks about gladiators, about horses, about
athletes, or what is worse about men? Such a person is
bad, such a person is good: this was well done, this was
done badly. Further, if he scoff, or ridicule, or show an
ill-natured disposition? Is any man among us prepared
like a lute-player when he takes a lute, so that as soon as
he has touched the strings, he discovers which are dis-
cordant, and tunes the instrument? such a power as
Socrates had who in all his social intercourse could lead
his companions to his own purpose? How should you
have this power? It is therefore a necessary consequence
that you are carried about by the common kind of people.</p>
<p>Why then are they more powerful than you? Because
they utter these useless words from their real opinions:
but you utter your elegant words only from your lips; for
this reason they are without strength and dead, and it is
nauseous<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">sikxa=nai</foreign>. See Antoninus v. 9.</note> to listen to your exhortations and your miserable virtue, which is talked of every where (up and down).
In this way the vulgar have the advantage over you: for
every opinion (<foreign lang="greek">do/gma</foreign>) is strong and invincible. Until then
the good (<foreign lang="greek">komyai/</foreign>) sentiments (<foreign lang="greek">u(polh/yeis</foreign>) are fixed in you,
and you shall have acquired a certain power for your
security, I advise you to be careful in your association
with common persons: if you are not, every day like wax
in the sun there will be melted away whatever you
inscribe on your minds in the school. Withdraw then
yourselves far from the sun so long as you have these
waxen sentiments. For this reason also philosophers
advise men to leave their native country, because antient
habits distract them and do not allow a beginning to be
<pb n="238"/>
made of a different habit; nor can we tolerate those who
meet us and say: See such a one is now a philosopher,
who was once so and so. Thus also physicians send those
who have lingering diseases to a different country and a
different air; and they do right. Do you also introduce
other habits than those which you have: fix your opinions
and exercise yourselves in them. But you do not so: you
go hence to a spectacle, to a show of gladiators, to a place
of exercise (<foreign lang="greek">custo/n</foreign>), to a circus; then you come back
hither, and again from this place you go to those places,
and still the same persons. And there is no pleasing (good)
habit, nor attention, nor care about self and observation of
this kind, How shall I use the appearances presented to
me? according to nature, or contrary to nature? how do I
answer to them? as I ought, or as I ought not? Do I say
to those things which are independent of the will, that
they do not concern me? For if you are not yet in this
state, fly from your former habits, fly from the common
sort, if you intend ever to begin to be something.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<head>That we ought not to be disturbed by any news.</head>
<p>WHEN any thing shall be reported to you which is of a
nature to disturb, have this principle in readiness, that
the news is about nothing which is within the power of
your will. Can any man report to you that you have
formed a bad opinion, or had a bad desire? By no means.
But perhaps he will report that some person is dead.
What then is that to you? He may report that some
person speaks ill of you. What then is that to you? Or
that your father is planning something or other. Against
whom? Against your will (<foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>)? How can he?
But is it against your poor body, against your little pro-
<pb n="240"/>
perty? You are quite safe: it is not against you. But
the judge declares that you have committed an act of
impiety. And did not the judges (<foreign lang="greek">di/kastai</foreign>) make the same
declaration against Socrates? Does it concern you that
the judge has made this declaration? No. Why then do
you trouble yourself any longer about it? Your father
has a certain duty, and if he shall not fulfil it, he loses
the character of a father, of a man of natural affection, of
gentleness. Do not wish him to lose any thing else on
this account. For never does a man do wrong in one
thing, and suffer in another. On the other side it is your
duty to make your defence firmly, modestly, without
anger: but if you do not, you also lose the character of
a son, of a man of modest behavior, of generous character.
Well then, is the judge free from danger? No; but he
also is in equal danger. Why then are you still afraid of
his decision? What have you to do with that which is
another man's evil? It is your own evil to make a bad
defence: be on your guard against this only. But to be
condemned or not to be condemned, as that is the act of
another person, so it is the evil of another person. A cer-
tain person threatens you. Me? No. He blames you.
Let him see how he manages his own affairs. He is going
to condemn you unjustly. He is a wretched man.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<head>What is the condition of a common kind of man and of
a philosopher.</head>
<p>THE first difference between a common person (<foreign lang="greek">i)diw/ths</foreign>)
and a philosopher is this: the common person says, Woe
to me for my little child, for my brother, for my father.<note anchored="yes">Compare iii. 5. 4.</note>
The philosopher, if he shall ever be compelled to say, Woe
to me, stops and says, 'but for myself.' For nothing
which is independent of the will can hinder or damage
<pb n="241"/>
the will, and the will can only hinder or damage itself.
If then we ourselves incline in this direction, so as, when
we are unlucky, to blame ourselves and to remember
that nothing else is the cause of perturbation or loss of
tranquillity except our own opinion, I swear to you by
all the gods that we have made progress. But in the
present state of affairs we have gone another way from
the beginning. For example, while we were still children,
the nurse, if we ever stumbled through want of care, did
not chide us, but would beat the stone. But what did the
stone do? Ought the stone to have moved on account of
your child's folly? Again, if we find nothing to eat on
coming out of the bath, the paedagogue never checks our
appetite, but he flogs the cook. Man, did we make you
the paedagogue of the cook and not of the child?<note anchored="yes">I have not followed Schweighaeuser's text here. See his note.</note> Correct
the child, improve him. In this way even when we are
grown up we are like children. For he who is unmusical
is a child in music; he who is without letters is a child in
learning: he who is untaught, is a child in life.</p></div2>

<head>That we can derive advantage from all external things.</head>
<p>IN the case of appearances which are objects of the vision,<note anchored="yes">The original is <foreign lang="greek">qewrhtikw=n fantasiw=n</foreign>, which is translated in the

means. It is said in the Index Graecitatis (Schweig.'s ed.): '<foreign lang="greek">fantasi/ai qewrhtikai/</foreign>, notiones theoretical, iii. 20. 1, quibus opponuntur Practicae

nearly all have allowed the good and the evil to be in
ourselves, and not in externals. No one gives the name
of good to the fact that it is day, nor bad to the fact
that it is night, nor the name of the greatest evil to the
opinion that three are four. But what do men say? They
<pb n="242"/>
say that knowledge is good, and that error is bad; so that
even in respect to falsehood itself there is a good result,
the knowledge that it is falsehood. So it ought to be in
life also. Is health a good thing, and is sickness a bad
thing? No, man. But what is it? To be healthy, and
healthy in a right way, is good: to be healthy in a bad
way is bad; so that it is possible to gain advantage even
from sickness, I declare. For is it not possible to gain
advantage even from death, and is it not possible to gain
advantage from mutilation? Do you think that Menoeceus
gained little by death?<note anchored="yes">Menoeceus, the son of Creon, gave up his life by which he would
save his country, as it was declared by an oracle. (Cicero, Tuscul. i. e. 48.) Juvenal (Sat. xiv. 238) says

much as Menoeceus gained? Come, man, did he not maintain the character of being a lover of his country, a man of
great mind, faithful, generous? And if he had continued
to live, would he not have lost all these things? would he
not have gained the opposite? would he not have gained
the name of coward, ignoble, a hater of his country, a man
who feared death?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> Well, do you think that he gained
little by dying? I suppose not. But did the father of
Admetus<note anchored="yes">The father of Admetus was Phe es (Euripides, Alcestis)</note> gain much by prolonging his life so ignobly
and miserably? Did he not die afterwards? Cease, I
adjure you by the gods, to admire material things. Cease
to make yourselves slaves, first of things, then on account
of things slaves of those who are able to give them or take
them away.</p>
<p>Can advantage then be derived from these things?
From all; and from him who abuses you. Wherein
does the man who exercises before the combat profit the
athlete? Very greatly. This man becomes my exerciser
before the combat: he exercises me in endurance, in keeping my temper, in mildness. You say no: but he, who lays
hold of my neck and disciplines my loins and shoulders,
<pb n="243"/>
does me good; and the exercise master (the aliptes, or
oiler) does right when he says; Raise him up with both
hands, and the heavier he (<foreign lang="greek">e)kei=nos</foreign>) is, so much the more is
my advantage.<note anchored="yes">The meaning is not clear, if we follow the original text. Schweig.
cannot see the sense 'with both hands' in the Greek, nor can I. He
also says that in the words <foreign lang="greek">a)=ron u(pe\r a)mfote/ras</foreign> unless some masculine
noun is understood which is not expressed, <foreign lang="greek">e)kei=nos</foreign> must be referred to
the aliptes; and he translates <foreign lang="greek">baru/teros</foreign> by 'severior.'</note> But if a man exercises me in keeping my
temper, does he not do me good?&mdash;This is not knowing
how to gain an advantage from men. Is my neighbour
bad? Bad to himself, but good to me: he exercises my
good disposition, my moderation. Is my father bad? Bad
to himself, but to me good. This is the rod of Hermes:

<p>You say No: but take care that you do not fall sick: it
is a bad thing. This is the same as if you should say, Take
care that you never receive the impression (appearance) that
three are four: that is bad. Man, how is it bad? If I think
about it as I ought, how shall it then do me any damage?
and shall it not even do me good? If then I think about
poverty as I ought to do, about disease, about not having

then do not vomit it up thus: if you do not digest it,

unfit to eat. But after digestion show us some change
in your ruling faculty, as athletes show in their shoulders
by what they have been exercised and what they have

what they have learned. The carpenter does not come
and say, Hear me talk about the carpenter's art; but

proves that he knows the art. You also ought to do
something of the kind; eat like a man, drink like a

which they shall be able to bear well the things that
happen and derive honour from them?<note anchored="yes">This passage is one of those which show the great good sense of
Epictetus in the matter of education; and some other remarks to the
same effect follow in this chapter. A man might justly say that we
have no clear notion of the purpose of education. A modern writer,
who seems to belong to the school of Epictetus says: <quote>it cannot be
denied that in all schools of all kinds it ought to be the first and the
chief object to make children healthy, good, honest, and, if possible,
sensible men and women; and if this is not done in a reasonable
degree, I maintain that the education of these schools is good for
nothing&mdash;I do not propose to make children good and honest and wise
by precepts and dogmas and preaching, as you will see. They must
be made good and wise by a cultivation of the understanding, by the
practice of the discipline necessary for that purpose, and by the
example of him who governs, directs and instructs.</quote> Further, <quote>my
men and women teachers have something which the others have not:
they have a purpose, an end in their system of education; and what is
education? What is human life without some purpose or end which
may be attained by industry, order and the exercise of moderate
abilities? Great abilities are rare, and they are often accompanied by
qualities which make the abilities useless to him who has them, and
even injurious to society.</quote></note> And how can
you give them any of these things which you do not
possess? Have you done from the beginning any thing
else than employ yourself about the resolution of Syllo-
<pb n="246"/>
gisms, of sophistical arguments (<foreign lang="greek">oi( metapi/ptontes</foreign>), and in
those which work by questions? But such a man has a
school; why should not I also have a school? These
things are not done, man, in a careless way, nor just as
it may happen; but there must be a (fit) age and life
and God as a guide. You say, No. But no man sails
from a port without having sacrificed to the Gods and
invoked their help; nor do men sow without having called
on Demeter; and shall a man who has undertaken so great
a work undertake it safely without the Gods? and shall
they who undertake this work come to it with success?
What else are you doing, man, than divulging the mys-
teries? You say, there is a temple at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, and one
here also. There is an Hierophant at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">There was a great temple of Demeter (<placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>) at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>,
and solemn mysteries, and an Hierophant or conductor of the ceremonies.</note> and I also
will make an Hierophant: there is a herald, and I will
establish a herald: there is a torchbearer at <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, and
I also will establish a torchbearer; there are torches at
<placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName>, and I will have torches here. The words are
the same: how do the things done here differ from those
done there?&mdash;Most impious man, is there no difference?
these things are done both in due place and in due time;
and when accompanied with sacrifice and prayers, when a
man is first purified, and when he is disposed in his mind
to the thought that he is going to approach sacred rites
and antient rites. In this way the mysteries are useful,
in this way we come to the notion that all these things
were established by the antients for the instruction and
correction of life.<note anchored="yes">See the note of T. Burnet, De Fide et Officiis Christianorum, Ed.
Sec. p. 89.</note> But you publish and divulge them
out of time, out of place, without sacrifices, without purity;
you have not the garments which the hierophant ought to
have, nor the hair, nor the headdress, nor the voice, nor
the age; nor have you purified yourself as he has: but
you have committed to memory the words only, and you
say, Sacred are the words by themselves.<note anchored="yes">The reader, who has an inclination to compare religious forms
antient and modern, may find something in modern practice to which
the words of Epictetus are applicable.</note>
<pb n="247"/>
You ought to approach these matters in another way:
the thing is great, it is mystical, not a common thing,
nor is it given to every man. But not even wisdom<note anchored="yes">This is a view of the fitness of a teacher which, as far as I know,
is quite new; and it is also true. Perhaps there was some vague
notion of this kind in modern <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> at the time when teachers of
youths were only priests, and when it was supposed that their fitness
for the office of teacher was secured by their fitness for the office of
priest. In the present 'Ordering of Deacons' in the Church of <placeName key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, the person, who is proposed as a fit person to be a deacon, is
asked the following question by the bishop: 'Do you trust that you are
inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office and
ministration to serve God for the promotion of his glory and the edifying
of his people?' 'In the ordering of Priests' this question is omitted,
and another question only is put, which is used also in the ordering
of Deacons; 'Do you think in your heart that you be truly called,
according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ' etc. The teacher
ought to have God to advise him to occupy the office of teacher, as
Epictetus says. He does not say how God will advise: perhaps he
supposed that this advice might be given in the way in which <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>
said that he received it.
<p>' Wisdom perhaps is not enough' to enable a man to take care of
youths. Whatever 'wisdom' may mean, it is true that a teacher
should have a fitness and liking for the business. If he has not, he
will find it disagreeable, and he will not do it well. He may and
ought to gain a reasonable living by his labour: if he seeks only
money and wealth, he is on the wrong track, and he is only like a
common dealer in buying and selling, a butcher or a shoemaker, or a
tailor, all useful members of society and all of them necessary in their
several kinds. But the teacher has a priestly office, the making, as
far as it is possible, children into good men and women. Should he
he 'ordered' like a Deacon or a Priest, for his office is even more useful
than that of Priest or Deacon? Some will say that this is ridiculous.
Perhaps the wise will not think so.</p></note>
perhaps is enough to enable a man to take care of youths:
a man must have also a certain readiness and fitness for
this purpose, and a certain quality of body, and above all
things he must have God to advise him to occupy this
office, as God advised Socrates to occupy the place of one
who confutes error, Diogenes the office of royalty and
reproof, and the office of teaching precepts. But you open
a doctor's shop, though you have nothing except physic:
but where and how they should be applied, you know not
nor have you taken any trouble about it. See, that man
says, I too have salves for the eyes. Have you also the
<pb n="248"/>
power of using them? Do you know both when and how
they will do good, and to whom they will do good? Why
then do you act at hazard in things of the greatest impor-
tance? why are you careless? why do you undertake a
thing that is in no way fit for you? Leave it to those who
are able to do it, and to do it well. Do not yourself bring
disgrace on philosophy through your own acts, and be not
one of those who load it with a bad reputation. But it
theorems please you, sit still, and turn them over by your-
self; but never say that you are a philosopher, nor allow
another to say it; but say: He is mistaken, for neither are
my desires different from what they were before, nor is my
activity directed to other objects, nor do I assent to other
things, nor in the use of appearances have I altered at all
from my former condition. This you must think and say
about yourself, if you would think as you ought: if not
act at hazard, and do what you are doing; for it becomes
you.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<head>About Cynism.</head>
<p>WHEN one of his pupils inquired of Epictetus, and he was
a person who appeared to be inclined to Cynism, what
kind of person a Cynic ought to be and what was the
notion (<foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign>) of the thing, we will inquire, said Epictetus, at leisure: but I have so much to say to you that
he who without God attempts so great a matter, is hateful
to God, and has no other purpose than to act indecently
in public. For in any well-managed house no man comes
forward, and says to himself, I ought to be manager of
the house. If he does so, the master turns round, and
seeing him insolently giving orders, drags him forth and
flogs him. So it is also in this great city (the world);
for here also there is a master of the house who orders
every thing. (He says) You are the sun; you can by
going round make the year and seasons, and make the
<pb n="249"/>
fruits grow and nourish them, and stir the winds and
make them remit, and warm the bodies of men properly:
go, travel round, and so administer things from the greatest
to the least. You are a calf; when a lion shall appear,
do your proper business (<hi rend="ital">i. e.</hi> run away): if you do not,
you will suffer. You are a bull: advance and fight, for
this is your business, and becomes you, and you can do it.
You can lead the army against <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>; be Agamemnon.
You can fight in single combat against <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>: be
Achilles. But if Thersites<note anchored="yes">See the description of Thersites in the Iliad, ii. 212.</note> came forward and claimed
the command, he would either not have obtained it; or
if he did obtain it, he would have disgraced himself
before many witnesses.</p>
<p>Do you also think about the matter carefully: it is not
what it seems to you. (You say) I wear a cloak now
and I shall wear it then: I sleep hard now, and I shall
sleep hard then: I will take in addition a little bag now
and a staff, and I will go about and begin to beg and to
abuse those whom I meet; and if I see any man plucking
the hair out of his body, I will rebuke him, or if he has
dressed his hair, or if he walks about in purple&mdash;If you
imagine the thing to be such as this, keep far away from
it: do not approach it: it is not at all for you. But if
you imagine it to be what it is, and do not think your-
self to be unfit for it, consider what a great thing you
undertake.</p>
<p>In the first place in the things which relate to yourself,
you must not be in any respect like what you do now:
you must not blame God or man: you must take away
desire altogether, you must transfer avoidance (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisis</foreign>)
only to the things which are within the power of the will:
you must not feel anger nor resentment nor envy nor pity;
a girl must not appear handsome to you, nor must you
love a little reputation, nor be pleased with a boy or a
cake. For you ought to know that the rest of men throw
walls around them and houses and darkness when they
do any such things, and they have many means of con-
cealment. A man shuts the door, he sets somebody before
<pb n="250"/>
the chamber: if a person comes, say that he is out, he is
not at leisure. But the Cynic instead of all these things
must use modesty as his protection: if he does not, he
will be indecent in his nakedness and under the open sky.
This is his house, his door: this is the slave before his
bedchamber: this is his darkness. For he ought not to
wish to hide any thing that he does: and if he does, he
is gone, he has lost the character of a Cynic, of a man
who lives under the open sky, of a free man: he has
begun to fear some external thing, he has begun to have
need of concealment, nor can he get concealment when
he chooses. For where shall he hide himself and how?
And if by chance this public instructor shall be detected,
this paedagogue, what kind of things will he be compelled
to suffer? when then a man fears these things, is it pos-
sible for him to be bold with his whole soul to superintend
men? It cannot be: it is impossible.</p>
<p>In the first place then you must make your ruling
faculty pure, and this mode of life also. Now (you should
say), to me the matter to work on is my understanding,
as wood is to the carpenter, as hides to the shoemaker;
and my business is the right use of appearances. But the
body is nothing to me: the parts of it are nothing to me.
Death? Let it come when it chooses, either death of the
whole or of a part. Fly, you say. And whither; can
any man eject me out of the world? He cannot. But
wherever I go, there is the sun, there is the moon, there
are the stars, dreams, omens, and the conversation (<foreign lang="greek">o(mili/a</foreign>)
with Gods.</p>
<p>Then, if he is thus prepared, the true Cynic cannot be
satisfied with this; but he must know that he is sent a
messenger from Zeus to men about good and bad things,<note anchored="yes">The office which in our times corresponds to this description of the
Cynic, is the office of a teacher of religion.</note> to
show them that they have wandered and are seeking the
substance of good and evil where it is not, but where it
is, they never think; and that he is a spy, as Diogenes<note anchored="yes">See i. 24, note.*</note>
was carried off to Philip after the battle of Chaeroneia as
a spy. For in fact a Cynic is a spy of the things which
<pb n="251"/>
are good for men and which are evil, and it is his duty to
examine carefully and to come and report truly, and not
to be struck with terror so as to point out as enemies
those who are not enemies, nor in any other way to be
perturbed by appearances nor confounded.</p>
<p>It is his duty then to be able with a loud voice, if the
occasion should arise, and appearing on the tragic stage
to say like <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>: Men, whither are you hurrying, what

Wretch, which of your affairs goes badly? Your posses-
sions? No. Your body? No. But you are rich in gold
and copper. What then is the matter with you? That
part of you, whatever it is, has been neglected by you
and is corrupted, the part with which we desire, with
which we avoid, with which we move towards and
move from things. How neglected? He knows not
the nature of good for which he is made by nature and
the nature of evil; and what is his own, and what be-
longs to another; and when any thing that belongs to
others goes badly, he says, Wo to me, for the Hellenes
are in danger. Wretched is his ruling faculty, and alone
neglected and uncared for. The Hellenes are going to
die destroyed by the Trojans. And if the Trojans do
not kill them, will they not die? Yes; but not all at
once. What difference then does it make? For if death
is an evil, whether men die altogether, or if they die
singly, it is equally an evil. Is any thing else then going
to happen than the separation of the soul and the body?<note anchored="yes">Man then is supposed to consist of a soul and of a body. It may
be useful to remember this when we are explaining other passages in
Epictetus</note>
Nothing. And if the Hellenes perish, is the door closed,
and is it not in your power to die? It is. Why then do
you lament (and say) Oh, you who are a king and have
the sceptre of Zeus? An unhappy king does not exist
more than an unhappy god. What then art thou? In
truth a shepherd: for you weep as shepherds do, when
a wolf has carried off one of their sheep: and these who
<pb n="253"/>
are governed by you are sheep. And why did you come
hither? Was your desire in any danger? was your aver-
sion (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisis</foreign>)? was your movement (pursuits)? was your
avoidance of things? He replies, No; but the wife of my
brother was carried off. Was it not then a great gain
to be deprived of an adulterous wife?&mdash;Shall we be de-
spised then by the Trojans?&mdash;What kind of people are
the Trojans, wise or foolish? If they are wise, why do
you fight with them? If they are fools, why do you care
about them?</p>
<p>In what then is the good, since it is not in these things?
Tell us, you who are lord, messenger and spy. Where
you do not think that it is, nor choose to seek it: for if
you chose to seek it, you would have found it to be in
yourselves; nor would you be wandering out of the way,
nor seeking what belongs to others as if it were your own.
Turn your thoughts into yourselves: observe the precon-
ceptions which you have. What kind of a thing do you
imagine the good to be? That which flows easily, that
which is happy, that which is not impeded. Come, and
do you not naturally imagine it to be great, do you not
imagine it to be valuable? do you not imagine it to be
free from harm? In what material then ought you to
seek for that which flows easily, for that which is not im-
peded? in that which serves or in that which is free? In
that which is free. Do you possess the body then free or
is it in servile condition? We do not know. Do you not
know that it is the slave of fever, of gout, ophthalmia,
dysentery, of a tyrant, of fire, of iron, of every thing
which is stronger? Yes, it is a slave. How then is it
possible that any thing which belongs to the body can be
free from hindrance? and how is a thing great or valuable
which is naturally dead, or earth, or mud? Well then, do
you possess nothing which is free? Perhaps nothing.
And who is able to compel you to assent to that which
appears false? No man. And who can compel you not
to assent to that which appears true? No man. By this
then you see that there is something in you naturally free.
But to desire or to be averse from, or to move towards an
object or to move from it, or to prepare yourself, or to
propose to do any thing, which of you can do this, unless
<pb n="254"/>
he has received an impression of the appearance of that
which is profitable or a duty? No man. You have then
in these things also something which is not hindered and
is free. Wretched men, work out this, take care of this,
seek for good here.</p>
<p>And how is it possible that a man who has nothing,
who is naked, houseless, without a hearth, squalid, without
a slave, without a city, can pass a life that flows easily?
See, God has sent you a man to show you that it is pos-
sible.<note anchored="yes"><quote>It is observable that Epictetus seems to think it a necessary
qualification in a teacher sent from God for the instruction of mankind to be destitute of all external advantages and a suffering
character. Thus doth this excellent man, who had carried human
reason to so great a height, bear testimony to the propriety of that
method which the divine wisdom hath thought fit to follow in the
scheme of the Gospel; whose great author had not <hi rend="ital">where to lay his</hi>
<hi rend="ital">head;</hi> and which some in later ages have inconsiderately urged as an
argument against the Christian religion. The infinite disparity
between the proposal of the example of Diogenes in Epictetus and of
our Redeemer in the New Testament is too obvious to need any enlargement.</quote> Mrs. Carter.</note> Look at me, who am without a city, without a
house, without possessions, without a slave; I sleep on
the ground; I have no wife, no children, no praetorium,
but only the earth and heavens, and one poor cloak. And
what do I want? Am I not without sorrow? am I not
without fear? Am I not free? When did any of you see
me failing in the object of my desire? or ever falling into
that which I would avoid? did I ever blame God or man?<note anchored="yes">Some of the antients, who called themselves philosophers, did
blame God and his administration of the world; and there are men
who do the same now. If a man is dissatisfied with the condition of
the world, he has the power of going out of it, as Epictetus often says;
and if he knows, as he must know, that he cannot alter the nature of
man and the conditions of human life, he may think it wise to withdraw from a state of things with which he is not satisfied. If he
believes that there is no God, he is at liberty to do what he thinks
best for himself; and if he does believe that there is a God, he may
still think that his power of quitting the world is a power which he
may exercise when he chooses. Many persons commit suicide, not
because they are dissatisfied with the state of the world, but for other
reasons. I have not yet heard of a modern philosopher who found fault
with the condition of human things, and voluntarily retired from life.
Our philosophers live as long as they can, and some of them take care
of themselves and of all that they possess; they even provide well for the comfort of those whom they leave behind them. The conclusion seems
to be that they prefer living in this world to leaving it, that their complaints are idle talk; and that being men of weak minds, and great
vanity they assume the philosopher's name, and while they try to
make others as dissatisfied as they profess themselves to be, they are
really enjoying themselves after their fashion as much as they can.
These men, though they may have the means of living with as much
comfort as the conditions of human life permit, are dissatisfied, and
they would, if they could, make as dissatisfied as themselves those who
have less means or making life tolerable. These grumblers are not
the men who give their money or their labour or their lives for increasing the happiness of mankind and diminishing the unavoidable
sufferings of human life; but they find it easier to blame God, when
they believe in him; or to find fault with things as they are, which is
more absurd, when they do not believe in God, and when they ought
to make the best that they can of the conditions under which we
live.</note>

such another as the Cynic that he may be worthy of being

the Cynic's sceptre and his royalty, and a worthy minister,
if he intends to be considered worthy of a Cynic's friendship, as Diogenes was a friend of Antisthenes, as Crates
was a friend of Diogenes. Do you think that if a man
comes to a Cynic and salutes him, that he is the Cynic's

dunghill on which you shall bear your fever and which
will shelter you from the north wind that you may not be

then do you think of attempting so great a thing (as the
life of a Cynic)?
<pb n="258"/></p>
<p>But, said the young man, shall marriage and the pro-
creation of children as a chief duty be undertaken by the
Cynic?<note anchored="yes">The Stoics recommended marriage, the procreation of children,
the discharge of magisterial offices, and the duties of social life
generally.</note> If you grant me a community of wise men,
Epictetus replies, perhaps no man will readily apply
himself to the Cynic practice. For on whose account
should he undertake this manner of life? However if we
suppose that he does, nothing will prevent him from
marrying and begetting children; for his wife will be
another like himself, and his father in law another like
himself, and his children will be brought up like himself. But in the present state of things which is like
that of an army placed in battle order, is it not fit that
the Cynic should without any distraction be employed only
on the ministration of God,<note anchored="yes"><quote>It is remarkable that Epictetus here uses the same word
(<foreign lang="greek">a)perispa/stws</foreign>) with <placeName key="tgn,1129393">St. Paul</placeName>, 1 Cor. vii. 35, and urges the same consideration, of applying wholly to the service of God, to dissuade from
marriage. His observation too that the state of things was then
(<foreign lang="greek">w(s e)n parata/cei</foreign>) like <hi rend="ital">that of an army prepared for battle,</hi> nearly resembles the Apostle's (<foreign lang="greek">e)nestw=sa a)na/gkh</foreign>) <hi rend="ital">present necessity.</hi> St. Paul
says 2 Tim. ii. 4 (<foreign lang="greek">ou)dei\s strateuo/menos e)mple/ketai</foreign> etc.) no man that
warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of life. So Epictetus says
here that a Cynic must not be (<foreign lang="greek">e)mpeplegme/non</foreign>) in relations etc. From
these and many other passages of Epictetus one would be inclined to
think that he was not unacquainted with St. Paul's Epistles or that
he had heard something of the Christian doctrine.</quote> Mrs. Carter.
<p>I do not find any evidence of Epictetus being acquainted with the
Epistles of Paul. It is possible that he had heard something of the
Christian doctrine, but I have not observed any evidence of the fact.
Epictetus and Paul have not the same opinion about marriage, for
Paul says that' if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
to marry than to burn.' Accordingly his doctrine is 'to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her
own husband.' He does not directly say what a man should do when
he is not able to maintain a wife; but the inference is plain what he
will do (I Cor. vii. 2). Paul's view of marriage differs from that of
Epictetus, who recommends marriage. Paul does not: he writes, 'I
say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they
abide even as I.' He does not acknowledge marriage and the begetting of children as a duty; which Epictetus did.</p>
<p>In the present condition of the world Epictetus says that the
'minister of God' should not marry, because the cares of a family
would distract him and make him unable to discharge his duties. There is sound sense in this. A 'minister of God' should not be distracted by the cares of a family, especially if he is poor.</p></note> able to go about among men,
<pb n="259"/>
not tied down to the common duties of mankind, nor
entangled in the ordinary relations of life, which if he
neglects, he will not maintain the character of an honour-
able and good man? and if he observes them he will lose
the character of the messenger, and spy and herald of God.
For consider that it is his duty to do something towards
his father in law, something to the other kinsfolks of his
wife, something to his wife also (if he has one). He is
also excluded by being a Cynic from looking after the
sickness of his own family, and from providing for their
support. And to say nothing of the rest, he must have a
vessel for heating water for the child that he may wash
it in the bath; wool for his wife when she is delivered of
a child, oil, a bed, a cup: so the furniture of the house is
increased. I say nothing of his other occupations, and of
his distraction. Where then now is that king, he who
devotes himself to the public interests,
<quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
<l>The people's guardian and so full of cares.</l></lg>
<p>Homer, Iliad ii. 25</p></quote>
whose duty it is to look after others, the married and
those who have children; to see who uses his wife well,
who uses her badly; who quarrels; what family is well
administered, what is not; going about as a physician
does and feels pulses? He says to one, you have a fever,
to another you have a head-ache, or the gout: he says to
one, abstain from food;<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">a)na/teinon</foreign>. Compare ii. 17, 9.</note> to another he says, eat; or do
not use the bath; to another, you require the knife, or the
cautery. How can he have time for this who is tied to
the duties of common life? is it not his duty to supply
clothing to his children, and to send them to the school-
master with writing tablets, and styles (for writing).<note anchored="yes">In the text it is <foreign lang="greek">grafei=a</foreign>, <foreign lang="greek">tilla/ria</foreign>. It is probable that there
should be only one word. See Schweig.'s note. <placeName key="tgn,2399199">Horace</placeName> (<bibl n="Hor. S. 1.6.73">Sat. i. 6.

<quote lang="la"><lg><l>Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto.</l></lg></quote></note>
Besides must he not supply them with beds? for they
<pb n="260"/>
cannot be genuine Cynics as soon as they are born. If he
does not do this, it would be better to expose the children
as soon as they are born than to kill them in this way.
Consider what we are bringing the Cynic down to, how
we are taking his royalty from him.&mdash;Yes, but Crates
took a wife.&mdash;You are speaking of a circumstance which
arose from love and of a woman who was another Crates.<note anchored="yes">The wife of Crates was Hipparchia, who persisted against all

Diogenes Laertius, vi. 96. <placeName key="tgn,2002086">Upton</placeName>.</note>
But we are inquiring about ordinary marriages and those
which are free from distractions,<note anchored="yes">There is some difficulty about <foreign lang="greek">a)perispa/stwn</foreign> here. <placeName key="tgn,2002086">Upton</placeName> proposed to write <foreign lang="greek">a)perista/twn</foreign>, which he explains 'that which has nothing

we do not find the affair of marriage in this state of the
world a thing which is especially suited to the Cynic.</p>
<p>How then shall a man maintain the existence of society?
In the name of God, are those men greater benefactors to
society who introduce into the world to occupy their own
places two or three grunting children,<note anchored="yes">Sehweig. translates <foreign lang="greek">kakorugxa</foreign> 'male grunnientes': perhaps it
means' ugly-faced.'</note> or those who superintend as far as they can all mankind, and see what they do,
how they live, what they attend to, what they neglect con-
trary to their duty? Did they who left little children to the
Thebans do them more good than Epaminondas who died
childless? And did Priamus who begat fifty worthless
sons or Danaus or Aeolus contribute more to the community than Homer? then shall the duty of a general or
the business of a writer exclude a man from marriage or
the begetting of children, and such a man shall not be
judged to have accepted the condition of childlessness for
nothing; and shall not the royalty of a Cynic be considered
an equivalent for the want of children? Do we not perceive his grandeur and do we not justly contemplate the
character of Diogenes; and do we instead of this turn our
eyes to the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables,
and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance
in breaking wind, but in nothing else? For such matters
would not have moved us at all nor should we have
wondered if a Cynic should not marry or beget children.
<pb n="261"/>
Man, the Cynic is the father of all men; the men are his
sons, the women are his daughters: he so carefully visits
all, so well does he care for all. Do you think that it is
from idle impertinence that he rebukes those whom he
meets? He does it as a father, as a brother, and as the
minister of the father of all, the minister of Zeus.</p>
<p>If you please, ask me also if a Cynic shall engage in the
administration of the state. Fool, do you seek a greater
form of administration than that in which he is engaged?
Do you ask if he shall appear among the Athenians and
say something about the revenues and the supplies, he
who must talk with all men, alike with Athenians, alike
with Corinthians, alike with Romans, not about supplies,
nor yet about revenues, nor about peace or war, but about
happiness and unhappiness, about good fortune and bad
fortune, about slavery and freedom? When a man has
undertaken the administration of such a state, do you ask
me if he shall engage in the administration of a state? ask
me also if he shall govern (hold a magisterial office): again
I will say to you, Fool, what greater government shall he
exercise than that which he exercises now?</p>
<p>It is necessary also for such a man (the Cynic) to have a
certain habit of body: for if he appears to be consumptive,
thin and pale, his testimony has not then the same weight.
For he must not only by showing the qualities of the soul
prove to the vulgar that it is in his power independent of the
things which they admire to be a good man, but he must
also show by his body that his simple and frugal way of
living in the open air does not injure even the body. See,
he says, I am a proof of this, and my own body also is.
So Diogenes used to do, for he used to go about fresh
looking, and he attracted the notice of the many by his
personal appearance. But if a Cynic is an object of com-
passion, he seems to be a beggar: all persons turn away
from him, all are offended with him; for neither ought he
to appear dirty so that he shall not also in this respect
drive away men; but his very roughness ought to be clean
and attractive.</p>
<p>There ought also to belong to the Cynic much natural
grace and sharpness; and if this is not so, he is a stupid
fellow, and nothing else; and he must have these qualities
<pb n="262"/>
that he may be able readily and fitly to be a match for all
circumstances that may happen. So Diogenes replied to
one who said, Are you the Diogenes who does not believe
that there are gods?<note anchored="yes">Diogenes Laertius, vi. 42.</note> And, how, replied Diogenes, can
this be when I think that you are odious to the gods?
On another occasion in reply to Alexander, who stood
by him when he was sleeping, and quoted Homer's line
(<placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName>, ii. 24)
<quote rend="blockquote">A man a councillor should not sleep all night,</quote>
he answered, when he was half asleep,
<quote rend="blockquote">The people's guardian and so full of cares.</quote></p>
<p>But before all the Cynic's ruling faculty must be purer
than the sun; and if it is not, he must necessarily be a
cunning knave and a fellow of no principle, since while he
himself is entangled in some vice he will reprove others.<note anchored="yes">The Cynic is in Epictetus the minister of religion. He must be
pure, for otherwise how can he reprove vice? This is a useful lesson
to those whose business it is to correct the vices of mankind.</note>
For see how the matter stands: to these kings and tyrants
their guards and arms give the power of reproving some
persons, and of being able even to punish those who do
wrong though they are themselves bad; but to a Cynic
instead of arms and guards it is conscience (<foreign lang="greek">to\ suneido/s</foreign>)
which gives this power. When he knows that he has
watched and laboured for mankind, and has slept pure,
and sleep has left him still purer, and that he thought
whatever he has thought as a friend of the gods, as a
minister, as a participator of the power of Zeus, and that
on all occasions he is ready to say
<quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
<l>Lead me, O Zeus, and thou, O Destiny;</l></lg></quote><note anchored="yes">See ii. 23, 42, note.</note>
and also, If so it pleases the gods, so let it be; why should
he not have confidence to speak freely to his own brothers,
to his children, in a word to his kinsmen? For this reason
he is neither over curious nor a busybody when he is in
<pb n="263"/>
this state of mind; for he is not a meddler with the affairs
of others when he is superintending human affairs, but he
is looking after his own affairs. If that is not so, you may
also say that the general is a busybody, when he inspects
his soldiers, and examines them and watches them and
punishes the disorderly. But if while you have a cake
under your arm, you rebuke others, I will say to you,
Will you not rather go away into a corner and eat that
which you have stolen; what have you to do with the
affairs of others? For who are you? are you the bull of
the herd, or the queen of the bees? Show me the tokens
of your supremacy, such as they have from nature. But if
you are a drone claiming the sovereignty over the bees, do
you not suppose that your fellow citizens will put you
down as the bees do the drones?</p>
<p>The Cynic also ought to have such power of endurance
as to seem insensible to the common sort and a stone: no
man reviles him, no man strikes him, no man insults him,
but he gives his body that any man who chooses may do
with it what he likes. For he bears in mind that the
inferior must be overpowered by the superior in that in
which it is inferior; and the body is inferior to the many,
the weaker to the stronger. He never then descends into
such a contest in which he can be overpowered; but he
immediately withdraws from things which belong to
others, he claims not the things which are servile. But
where there is will and the use of appearances, there you
will see how many eyes he has so that you may say, <placeName key="tgn,2003840">Argus</placeName>
was blind compared with him. Is his assent ever hasty,
his movement (towards an object) rash, does his desire
ever fail in its object, does that which he would avoid
befal him, is his purpose unaccomplished, does he ever find
fault, is he ever humiliated, is he ever envious? To these
he directs all his attention and energy; but as to every
thing else he snores supine. All is peace; there is no
robber who takes away his will,<note anchored="yes">This is quoted by M. Antoninus, xi. 36.</note> no tyrant. But what
say you as to his body? I say there is. And his possessions?
I say there is. And as to magistracies and honours?&mdash;
What does he care for them?&mdash;When then any person would

frighten him through them, he says to him, Begone, look
for children: masks are formidable to them; but I know
that they are made of shell, and they have nothing inside.</p>
<p>About such a matter as this you are deliberating.
Therefore, if you please, I urge you in God's name, defer
the matter, and first consider your preparation for it. For

<head>To those who read and discuss for the sake of ostentation.</head><note anchored="yes">Epictetus in an amusing manner touches on the practice of
Sophists, Rhetoricians, and others, who made addresses only to get
praise. This practice of reciting prose or verse compositions was
common in the time of Epictetus, as we may learn from the letters of
the younger <placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName>, Juvenal, Martial, and the author of the treatise de
Causis corruptae eloqwuntiae. <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>.</note>
<p>FIRST say to yourself Who you wish to be: then do
accordingly what you are doing; for in nearly all other
things we see this to be so. Those who follow athletic
exercises first determine what they wish to be, then they
do accordingly what follows. If a man is a runner in
the long course, there is a certain kind of diet, of
walking, rubbing, and exercise: if a man is a runner
in the stadium, all these things are different; if he is a
Pentathlete, they are still more different. So you will
find it also in the arts. If you are a carpenter, you will
have such and such things: if a worker in metal, such
things. For every thing that we do, if we refer it to no
end, we shall do it to no purpose; and if we refer it to
<pb n="265"/>
the wrong end, we shall miss the mark. Further, there
is a general end or purpose, and a particular purpose.
First of all, we must act as a man. What is comprehended in this? We must not be like a sheep, though
gentle; nor mischievous, like a wild beast. But the
particular end has reference to each person's mode of life
and his will. The lute-player acts as a lute-player, the
carpenter as a carpenter, the philosopher as a philosopher,
the rhetorician as a rhetorician. When then you say,
Come and hear me read to you: take care first of all that
you are not doing this without a purpose; then if you
have discovered that you are doing this with reference to
a purpose, consider if it is the right purpose. Do you
wish to do good or to be praised? Immediately you hear
him saying, To me what is the value of praise from the
many? and he says well, for it is of no value to a
musician, so far as he is a musician, nor to a geometrician. Do you then wish to be useful? in what? tell us
that we may run to your audience room. Now can a man
do anything useful to others, who has not received something useful himself? No, for neither can a man do any
thing useful in the carpenter's art, unless he is a carpenter;
nor in the shoemaker's art, unless he is a shoemaker.</p>
<p>Do you wish to know then if you have received any
advantage? Produce your opinions, philosopher. What
is the thing which desire promises? Not to fail in the
object. What does aversion promise? Not to fall into
that which you would avoid. Well; do we fulfill their
promise? Tell me the truth; but if you lie, I will tell
you. Lately when your hearers came together rather
coldly, and did not give you applause, you went away
humbled. Lately again when you had been praised, you
went about and said to all, What did you think of me?
Wonderful, master, I swear by all that is dear to me. But
how did I treat of that particular matter? Which? The
passage in which I described Pan and the nymphs?<note anchored="yes">Such were the subjects which the literary men of the day de.
lighted in.</note> Excellently. Then do you tell me that in desire and in
aversion you are acting according to nature? Be gone;
try to persuade somebody else. Did you not praise a cer-
<pb n="266"/>
tain person contrary to your opinion? and did you not
flatter a certain person who was the son of a senator?
Would you wish your own children to be such persons?&mdash;I
hope not&mdash;Why then did you praise and flatter him? He
is an ingenuous youth and listens well to discourses&mdash;
How is this?&mdash;He admires me. You have stated your
proof. Then what do you think? do not these very people
secretly despise you? When then a man who is conscious
that he has neither done any good nor ever thinks of it,
finds a philosopher who says, You have a great natural
talent, and you have a candid and good disposition, what
else do you think that he says except this, This man has
some need of me? Or tell me what act that indicates a
great mind has he shown? Observe; he has been in your
company a long time; he has listened to your discourses,
he has heard you reading; has he become more modest?
has he been turned to reflect on himself? has he per-
ceived in what a bad state he is? has he cast away self-
conceit? does he look for a person to teach him? He does.
A man who will teach him to live? No, fool, but how to
talk; for it is for this that he admires you also. Listen
and hear what he says: This man writes with perfect
art, much better than Dion.<note anchored="yes">Dion of <placeName key="tgn,7002420">Prusa</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName> was named Chrysostomus (golden-
mouthed) because of his eloquence. He was a rhetorician and sophist,
as the term was then understood, and was living at the same time as
Epictetus. Eighty of his orations written in Greek are still extant,
and some fragments of fifteen.</note> This is altogether another
thing. Does he say, This man is modest, faithful, free
from perturbations? and even if he did say it, I should
say to him, Since this man is faithful, tell me what this
faithful man is. And if he could not tell me, I should
add this, First understand what you say, and then speak.</p>
<p>You then, who are in a wretched plight and gaping
after applause and counting your auditors, do you intend
to be useful to others?&mdash;To-day many more attended my
discourse. Yes, many; we suppose five hundred. That
is nothing; suppose that there were a thousand&mdash;<placeName key="tgn,1123427">Dion</placeName>
never had so many hearers&mdash;How could he?&mdash;And they
understand what is said beautifully. What is fine, master,
can move even a stone&mdash;See, these are the words of a
<pb n="267"/>
philosopher. This is the disposition of a man who will
do good to others; here is a man who has listened to discourses, who has read what is written about Socrates as
Socratic, not as the compositions of Lysias and Isocrates.
'I have often wondered by what arguments.'<note anchored="yes">These words are the beginning of Xenophon's <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.1">Memorabilia, i. 1.</bibl>
The small critics disputed whether the text should be <foreign lang="greek">ti/si lo/gois</foreign>, or
<foreign lang="greek">ti/ni lo/gw|</foreign>.</note> Not so,
but 'by what argument': this is more exact than that&mdash;
What, have you read the words at all in a different way
from that in which you read little odes? For if you read
them as you ought, you would not have been attending to
such matters, but you would rather have been looking to
these words: <quote>Anytus and Melitus are able to kill me,
but they cannot harm me:</quote> <quote>and I am always of such a
disposition as to pay regard to nothing of my own except
to the reason which on inquiry seems to me the best.</quote><note anchored="yes">From the Crito of Plato, c. 6.</note>
Hence who ever heard Socrates say, <quote>I know something
and I teach;</quote> but he used to send different people to
different teachers. Therefore they used to come to him
and ask to be introduced to philosophers by him; and he
would take them and recommend them.&mdash;Not so; but as
he accompanied them he would say, Hear me to-day discoursing in the house of Quadratus.<note anchored="yes">The rich, says <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>, used to lend their houses for recitations, as
we learn from <placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName>, Ep. viii. 12 and Juvenal, vii. 40.
<lg type="pentameter">
<l>Si dulcedine famae</l>
<l>Succensus recites, maculosas commodat aedes.</l></lg>
Quadratus is a Roman name. There appears to be a confusion
between <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> and Quadratus. The man says, No. <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>
would not do so: but he would do, as a man might do now. He would
say on the road; I hope you will come to hear me. I don't find anything in the notes on this passage; but it requires explanation.</note> Why should I hear
you? Do you wish to show me that you put words
together cleverly? You put them together, man; and
what good will it do you?&mdash;But only praise me.&mdash;What
do you mean by praising?&mdash;Say to me, admirable, wonderful.&mdash;Well, I say so. But if that is praise whatever
it is which philosophers mean by the name (<foreign lang="greek">kathgori/a</foreign>)<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kathgori/a</foreign> is one of Aristotle's common terms.</note> of
<pb n="268"/>
good, what have I to praise in you? If it is good to speak
well, teach me, and I will praise you.&mdash;What then?
ought a man to listen to such things without pleasure?&mdash;
I hope not. For my part I do not listen even to a lute-
player without pleasure. Must I then for this reason
stand and play the lute? Hear what <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> says, Nor
would it be seemly for a man of my age, like a young
man composing addresses, to appear before you.<note anchored="yes">From Plato's Apology of Socrates.</note> Like a
young man, he says. For in truth this small art is an
elegant thing, to select words, and to put them together,
and to come forward and gracefully to read them or to
speak, and while he is reading to say, There are not
many who can do these things, I swear by all that you
value.</p>
<p>Does a philosopher invite people to hear him? As the
sun himself draws men to him, or as food does, does not
the philosopher also draw to him those who will receive
benefit? What physician invites a man to be treated by
him? Indeed I now hear that even the physicians in
<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> do invite patients, but when I lived there, the
physicians were invited. I invite you to come and hear
that things are in a bad way for you, and that you are
taking care of every thing except that of which you ought
to take care, and that you are ignorant of the good and
the bad and are unfortunate and unhappy. A fine kind
of invitation: and yet if the words of the philosopher do
not produce this effect on you, he is dead, and so is the
speaker. Rufus was used to say: If you have leisure to
praise me, I am speaking to no purpose.<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Gel. 5.1">Aulus Gellius v. 1</bibl>. <placeName key="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName>, Ep. 52. <placeName key="tgn,1015794">Upton</placeName>.</note> Accordingly
he used to speak in such a way that every one of us who
were sitting there supposed that some one had accused
him before Rufus: he so touched on what was doing, he
so placed before the eyes every man's faults.</p>
<p>The philosopher's school, ye men, is a surgery: you
ought not to go out of it with pleasure, but with pain.
For you are not in sound health when you enter: one has
dislocated his shoulder, another has an abscess, a third a
fistula, and a fourth a head ache. Then do I sit and utter to
<pb n="269"/>
you little thoughts and exclamations that you may praise
me and go away, one with his shoulder in the same condition in which he entered, another with his head still
aching, and a third with his fistula or his abscess just as
they were? Is it for this then that young men shall quit
home, and leave their parents and their friends and kin-
smen and property, that they may say to you, Wonderful!
when you are uttering your exclamations. Did <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>
do this, or <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, or Cleanthes?</p>
<p>What then? is there not the hortatory style? Who
denies it? as there is the style of refutation, and the
didactic style. Who then ever reckoned a fourth style
with these, the style of display? What is the hortatory
style? To be able to show both to one person and to
many the struggle in which they are engaged, and that
they think more about any thing than about what they
really wish. For they wish the things which lead to happiness, but they look for them in the wrong place. In
order that this may be done, a thousand seats must be
placed and men must be invited to listen, and you must
ascend the pulpit in a fine robe or cloak and describe the
death of Achilles. Cease, I intreat you by the gods, to
spoil good words and good acts as much as you can.
Nothing can have more power in exhortation that when
the speaker shows to the hearers that he has need of
them. But tell me who when he hears you reaching or
discoursing is anxious about himself or turns to reflect on
himself? or when he has gone out says, The philosopher
hit me well: I must no longer do these things. But does
he not, even if you have a great reputation, say to some
person? He spoke finely about Xerxes;<note anchored="yes"><cit><bibl n="Cic. Off. 1.18">Cicero, de Officiis i. 18:</bibl> <quote lang="la">'Quae magno animo

<head>That we ought not to be moved by a desire of those things which are not in our power. </head>
<p>LET not that which in another is contrary to nature be
an evil to you: for you are not formed by nature to be
depressed with others nor to be unhappy with others, but
to be happy with them. If a man is unhappy, remember
that his unhappiness is his own fault: for God has made
all men to be happy, to be free from perturbations. For
this purpose he has given means to them, some things to
each person as his own, and other things not as his own:
some things subject to hindrance and compulsion and
deprivation; and these things are not a man's own: but
the things which are not subject to hindrances, are his
own; and the nature of good and evil, as it was fit to be
done by him who takes care of us and protects us like a
father, he has made our own.&mdash;But you say, I have parted
from a certain person, and he is grieved.&mdash;Why did he
consider as his own that which belongs to another? why,
when he looked on you and was rejoiced, did he not also
reckon that you are mortal, that it is natural for you
to part from him for a foreign country? Therefore he
suffers the consequences of his own folly. But why do
you<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> or for what purpose bewail yourself? Is it that you
also have not thought of these things? but like poor
women who are good for nothing, you have enjoyed all
things in which you took pleasure, as if you would always
enjoy them, both places and men and conversation; and
now you sit and weep because you do not see the same
persons and do not live in the same places.&mdash;Indeed you
deserve this, to be more wretched than crows and ravens
who have the power of flying where they please and
changing their nests for others, and crossing the seas
without lamenting or regretting their former condition.&mdash;
Yes, but this happens to them because they are irrational
creatures.&mdash;Was reason then given to us by the gods for
<pb n="271"/>
the purpose of unhappiness and misery, that we may pass
our lives in wretchedness and lamentation? Must all
persons be immortal and must no man go abroad, and
must we ourselves not go abroad, but remain rooted like
plants; and if any of our familiar friends goes abroad,
must we sit and weep; and on the contrary, when he returns, must we dance and clap our hands like children?</p>
<p>Shall we not now wean ourselves and remember what
we have heard from the philosophers? if we did not listen
to them as if they were jugglers: they tell us that this
world is one city,<note anchored="yes">See ii. 5, 26.</note> and the substance out of which it has
been formed is one, and that there must be a certain period,
and that some things must give way to others, that some
must be dissolved, and others come in their place; some to
remain in the same place, and others to be moved; and
that all things are full of friendship, first of the gods,<note anchored="yes">See iii. 13. 15.</note> and
then of men who by nature are made to be of one family;
and some must be with one another, and others must be
separated, rejoicing in those who are with them, and not
grieving for those who are removed from them; and man
in addition to being by nature of a noble temper and
having a contempt of all things which are not in the
power of his will, also possesses this property not to be
rooted nor to be naturally fixed to the earth, but to go
at different times to different places, sometimes from the
urgency of certain occasions, and at others merely for the
sake of seeing. So it was with Ulysses, who saw
<quote rend="blockquote">Of many men the states, and learned their ways.</quote><note anchored="yes">Homer, Odyssey i. 3.</note>
And still earlier it was the fortune of <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> to visit
all the inhabited world
<quote rend="blockquote">Seeing men's lawless deeds and their good rules of law</quote><note anchored="yes">Odyssey, xvii. 487.</note>
casting out and clearing away their lawlessness and introducing in their place good rules of law. And yet how
many friends do you think that he had in <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>, bow
many in <placeName key="tgn,7010720">Argos</placeName>, how many in <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>? and how many do
<pb n="272"/>
you think that he gained by going about? And he married
also, when it seemed to him a proper occasion, and begot
children, and left them without lamenting or regretting
or leaving them as orphans; for he knew that no man is
an orphan; but it is the father who takes care of all men
always and continuously. For it was not as mere report
that he had heard that Zeus is the father of men, for he
thought that Zeus was his own father, and he called him
so, and to him he looked when he was doing what he did.
Therefore he was enabled to live happily in all places.
And it is never possible for happiness and desire of what
is not present to come together. For that which is happy
must have all<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)pe/xein</foreign>. See iii. 2, 13. Paul to the Philippians, iv. 18.</note> that it desires, must resemble a person
who is filled with food, and must have neither thirst nor
hunger.&mdash;But Ulysses felt a desire for his wife and wept
as he sat on a rock.&mdash;Do you attend to Homer and his
stories in every thing? Or if Ulysses really wept, what
was he else than an unhappy man? and what good man
is unhappy? In truth the whole is badly administered,
if Zeus does not take care of his own citizens that they
may be happy like himself. But these things are not
lawful nor right to think of: and if Ulysses did weep
and lament, he was not a good man. For who is good if
he knows not who he is? and who knows what he is, if he
forgets that things which have been made are perishable,
and that it is not possible for one human being to be with
another always? To desire then things which are impossible is to have a slavish character, and is foolish: it is
the part of a stranger, of a man who fights against God
in the only way that he can, by his opinions.</p>
<p>But my mother laments when she does not see me.&mdash;
Why has she not learned these principles? and I do not
say this, that we should not take care that she may not
lament, but I say that we ought not to desire in every
way what is not our own. And the sorrow of another is
another's sorrow: but my sorrow is my own. I then will
stop my own sorrow by every means, for it is in my power:
and the sorrow of another I will endeavour to stop as far
as I can; but I will not attempt to do it by every means;
<pb n="273"/>
for if I do, I shall be fighting against God, I shall be
opposing Zeus and shall be placing myself against him in
the administration of the universe; and the reward (the
punishment) of this fighting against God and of this disobedience not only will the children of my children pay,
but I also shall myself, both by day and by night, startled
by dreams, perturbed, trembling at every piece of news,
and having my tranquillity depending on the letters of
others.&mdash;Some person has arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. I only hope
that there is no harm. But what harm can happen to
you, where you are not?&mdash;From Hellas (<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>) some one
is come: I hope that there is no harm.&mdash;In this way every
place may be the cause of misfortune to you. Is it not
enough for you to be unfortunate there where you are, and
must you be so even beyond sea, and by the report of letters?
Is this the way in which your affairs are in a state of
security?&mdash;Well then suppose that my friends have died
in the places which are far from me.&mdash;What else have
they suffered than that which is the condition of mortals?
Or how are you desirous at the same time to live to old
age, and at the same time not to see the death of any
person whom you love? Know you not that in the course
of a long time many and various kinds of things must
happen; that a fever shall overpower one, a robber another, and a third a tyrant? Such is the condition of
things around us, such are those who live with us in the
world: cold and heat, and unsuitable ways of living, and
journeys by land, and voyages by sea, and winds, and
various circumstances which surround us, destroy one man,
and banish another, and throw one upon an embassy and
another into an army. Sit down then in a flutter at all
these things, lamenting, unhappy, unfortunate, dependent
on another, and dependent not on one or two, but on ten
thousands upon ten thousands.</p>
<p>Did you hear this when you were with the philosophers?
did you learn this? do you not know that human life is
a warfare? that one mail must keep watch, another must
go out as a spy, and a third must fight? and it is not pos-
sible that all should be in one place, nor is it better that
it should be so. But you neglecting to do the commands
of the general complain when any thing more hard than
<pb n="274"/>
usual is imposed on you, and you do not observe what
you make the army become as far as it is in your power;
that if all imitate you, no man will dig a trench, no man
will put a rampart round, nor keep watch, nor expose
himself to danger, but will appear to be useless for the
purposes of an army. Again, in a vessel if you go as a
sailor, keep to one place and stick to it. And if you are
ordered to climb the mast, refuse; if to run to the head
of the ship, refuse; and what master of a ship will endure
you? and will he not pitch you overboard as a useless
thing, an impediment only and bad example to the other
sailors? And so it is here also: every man's life is a
kind of warfare, and it is long and diversified. You must
observe the duty of a soldier and do every thing at the
nod of the general; if it is possible, divining what his
wishes are: for there is no resemblance between that
general and this, neither in strength nor in superiority
of character. You are placed in a great office of command
and not in any mean place; but you are always a senator.
Do you not know that such a man must give little time
to the affairs of his household, but be often away from
home, either as a governor or one who is governed, or
discharging some office, or serving in war or acting as a
judge? Then do you tell me that you wish, as a plant,
to be fixed to the same places and to be rooted?&mdash;Yes,
for it is pleasant.&mdash;Who says that it is not? but a soup is
pleasant, and a handsome woman is pleasant. What else
do those say who make pleasure their end? Do you not
see of what men you have uttered the language? that it
is the language of Epicureans and catamites? Next while
you are doing what they do and holding their opinions,
do you speak to us the words of <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>?
Will you not throw away as far as you can the things
belonging to others with which you decorate yourself,
though they do not fit you at all? For what else do they
desire than to sleep without hindrance and free from compulsion, and when they have risen to yawn at their leisure,
and to wash the face, then write and read what they choose,
and then talk about some trifling matter being praised by
their friends whatever they may say, then to go forth for
a walk, and having walked about a little to bathe, and then
<pb n="275"/>
eat and sleep, such sleep as is the fashion of such men?
why need we say how? for one can easily conjecture.
Come, do you also tell your own way of passing the time
which you desire, you who are an admirer of truth and
of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> and Diogenes. What do you wish to do in
<placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>? the same (that others do), or something else?
Why then do you call yourself a Stoic? Well, but they
who falsely call themselves Roman citizens,<note anchored="yes">Suetonius (<bibl n="Suet. Cl. 25">Claudius, 25</bibl>) says: <quote lang="la">'Peregrinae conditionis homines

is this not possible, but the law divine and strong and

not ashamed to go to the doors of a shoemaker, when you
are in want of shoes, nor to the door of a gardener, when
you want lettuces; and are you ashamed to go to the doors
of the rich when you want any thing?&mdash;Yes, for I have no
awe of a shoemaker&mdash;Don't feel any awe of the rich&mdash;Nor
<pb n="276"/>
will I flatter the gardener&mdash;And do not flatter the rich&mdash;
How then shall I get what I want?&mdash;Do I say to you, go as
if you were certain to get what you want? And do not I
only tell you, that you may do what is becoming to yourself? Why then should I still go? That you may have
gone, that you may have discharged the duty of a citizen,
of a brother, of a friend. And further remember that you
have gone to the shoemaker, to the seller of vegetables, who
have no power in any thing great or noble, though he may
sell dear. You go to buy lettuces: they cost an obolus
(penny), but not a talent. So it is here also. The matter
is worth going for to the rich man's door&mdash;Well, I will go
&mdash;It is worth talking about&mdash;Let it be so; I will talk with
him&mdash;But you must also kiss his hand and flatter him with
praise&mdash;Away with that, it is a talent's worth: it is not
profitable to me, nor to the state nor to my friends, to have
done that which spoils a good citizen and a friend.&mdash;But
you will seem not to have been eager about the matter, if
you do not succeed. Have you again forgotten why you
went? Know you not that a good man does nothing for
the sake of appearance, but for the sake of doing right?&mdash;
What advantage is it then to him to have done right?&mdash;And
what advantage is it to a man who writes the name of
<placeName key="tgn,1123427">Dion</placeName> to write it as he ought?&mdash;The advantage is to have
written it.&mdash;Is there no reward then<note anchored="yes">The reward of virtue is in the acts of virtue. The Stoics taught
that virtue is its own reward. When I was a boy I have written this
in copies, but I did not know what it meant. I know now that few
people believe it; and like the man here, they inquire what reward
they shall have for doing as they ought to do. A man of common
sense would give no other answer than what Epictetus gives. But
that will not satisfy all. The heathens must give the answer: 'For
what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service? Art
thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to thy
nature, and dost thou seek to be paid for it? just as if the eye de-
manded a recompense for seeing or the feet for walking.' M. Anto-
ninus. ix. 42. Compare <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName>, de Vita Beata, c. 9.</note>?&mdash;Do you seek a
reward for a good man greater than doing what is good
and just? At Olympia you wish for nothing more, but it
seems to you enough to be crowned at the games. Does it
seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be good and
<pb n="277"/>
happy? For these purposes being introduced by the gods
into this city (the world), and it being now your duty to
undertake the work of a man, do you still want nurses also
and a mamma, and do foolish women by their weeping move
you and make you effeminate? Will you thus never cease
to be a foolish child? know you not that he who does the
acts of a child, the older he is, the more ridiculous
he is?</p>
<p>In <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> did you see no one by going to his house?&mdash;
I visited any man that I pleased&mdash;Here also be ready to
see, and you will see whom you please: only let it be
without meanness, neither with desire nor with aversion,
and your affairs will be well managed. But this result
does not depend on going nor on standing at the doors,
but it depends on what is within, on your opinions.
When you have learned not to value things which are
external and not dependent on the will, and to consider
that not one of them is your own, but that these things
only are your own, to exercise the judgment well, to form
opinions, to move towards an object, to desire, to turn
from a thing, 'where is there any longer room for flattery,
where for meanness? why do you still long for the quiet
there (at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>), and for the places to which you are
accustomed? Wait a little and you will again find these
places familiar: then, if you are of so ignoble a nature,
again if you leave these also, weep and lament.</p>
<p>How then shall I become of an affectionate temper? By
being of a noble disposition, and happy. For it is not
reasonable to be mean-spirited nor to lament yourself, nor
to depend on another, nor ever to blame God or man. I
entreat you, become an affectionate person in this way, by
observing these rules. But if through this affection, as
you name it, you are going to be a slave and wretched,
there is no profit in being affectionate. And what prevents
you from loving another as a person subject to mortality,
as one who may go away from you. Did not Socrates love
his own children? He did; but it was as a free man, as
one who remembered that he must first be a friend to the
gods. For this reason he violated nothing which was becoming to a good man, neither in making his defence nor
<pb n="278"/>
by fixing a penalty on himself,<note anchored="yes">It was the custom at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> when the court (the dicasts) had determined to convict an accused person, in some cases at least, to ask
him what penalty he proposed to be inflicted on himself; but Socrates
refused to do this or to allow his friends to do it, for he said that to
name the penalty was the same as admitting his guilt (Xenophon,
<bibl n="Xen. Apol. 23">Apologia, 23</bibl>). Socrates said that if he did name a proper penalty for
himself, it would be that he should daily be allowed to dine in the
Prytaneium (Plato, Apology, c. 26; Cicero, De Oratore, i. <date value="54">54</date>).</note> nor even in the former part
of his life when he was a senator or when he was a soldier.
But we are fully supplied with every pretext for being
of ignoble temper, some for the sake of a child, some for a
mother, and others for brethren's sake. But it is not fit
for us to be unhappy on account of any person, but to be
happy on account of all, but chiefly on account of God who
has made us for this end. Well, did Diogenes<note anchored="yes">The character of Diogenes is described very differently by Epictetus from that which we read in common books.</note> love
nobody, who was so kind and so much a lover of all that
for mankind in general he willingly undertook so much
labour and bodily sufferings? He did love mankind, but
how? As became a minister of God, at the same time
caring for men, and being also subject to God. For this
reason all the earth was his country, and no particular
place; and when he was taken prisoner he did not regret
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> nor his associates and friends there, but even he
became familiar with the pirates and tried to improve
them; and being sold afterwards he lived in <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> as
before at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; and he would have behaved the same,
if he had gone to the country of the Perrhaebi.<note anchored="yes">A people in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> between the river Peneius and Mount
Olympus. It is the same as if Epictetus had said to any remote country.</note> Thus is
freedom acquired. For this reason he used to say, Ever
since Antisthenes made me free, I have not been a slave.
How did Antisthenes make him free? Hear what he says:
Antisthenes taught me what is my own, and what is not
my own; possessions are not my own, nor kinsmen,
domestics, friends, nor reputation, nor places familiar, nor
mode of life; all these belong to others. What then is
your own? The use of appearances. This he showed to
me, that I possess it free from hindrance, and from com-
<pb n="279"/>
pulsion, no person can put an obstacle in my way, no
person can force me to use appearances otherwise than I
wish. Who then has any power over me? Philip or
Alexander, or Perdiccas or the great king? How have they
this power? For if a man is going to be overpowered by
a man, he must long before be overpowered by things. If
then pleasure is not able to subdue a man, nor pain, nor
fame, nor wealth, but he is able, when he chooses, to spit
out all his poor body in a man's face and depart from life,
whose slave can he still be? But if he dwelt with pleasure
in Athens, and was overpowered by this manner of life,
his affairs would have been at every man's command; the
stronger would have had the power of grieving him. How
do you think that Diogenes would have flattered the
pirates that they might sell him to some Athenian, that
some time he might see that beautiful Piraeus, and the
Long Walls and the Acropolis? In what condition would
you see them? As a captive, a slave and mean: and what
would be the use of it for you?&mdash;Not so: but I should see
them as a free man&mdash;Show me, how you would be free.
Observe, some person has caught you, who leads you
away from your accustomed place of abode and says, You
are my slave, for it is in my power to hinder you from
living as you please, it is in my power to treat you gently,
and to humble you: when I choose, on the contrary you
are cheerful and go elated to Athens. What do you say to
him who treats you as a slave? What means have you of
finding one who will rescue you from slavery?<note anchored="yes">On the word <foreign lang="greek">karpisth/n</foreign> see the notes in Schweig.'s edition. The
word is supposed to be formed from <foreign lang="greek">karpi/s, karfi/s</foreign>, festuca.</note> Or cannot
you even look him in the face, but without saying more do
you intreat to be set free? Man, you ought to go gladly to
prison, hastening, going before those who lead you there.
Then, I ask you, are you unwilling to live in Rome and
desire to live in Hellas (Greece)? And when you must
die, will you then also fill us with your lamentations,
because you will not see Athens nor walk about in the
Lyceion? Have you gone abroad for this? was it for this
reason you have sought to find some person from whom
you might receive benefit? What benefit? That you may
<pb n="280"/>
solve syllogisms more readily, or handle hypothotical
arguments? and for this reason did you leave brother,
country, friends, your family, that you might return when
you had learned these things? So you did not go abroad
to obtain constancy of mind, nor freedom from perturbation,
nor in order that being secure from harm you may never
complain of any person, accuse no person, and no man may
wrong you, and thus you may maintain your relative
position without impediment? This is a fine traffic that
you have gone abroad for in syllogisms and sophistical
arguments<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">*metapi/ptontas</foreign>. See i. 7.</note> and hypothetical: if you like, take your
place in the agora (market or public place) and proclaim
them for sale like dealers in physic.<note anchored="yes">This is an old practice, to go about and sell physic to people.

deaf had stuff poured into their ears, paid their money, and made way

even all that you have learned that you may not bring a
bad name on your theorems as useless? What harm has
philosophy done you? Wherein has Chrysippus injured
you that you should prove by your acts that his labours
are useless? Were the evils that you had there (at home)
not enough, those which were the cause of your pain and
lamentation, even if you had not gone abroad? Have you
added more to the list? And if you again have other
acquaintances and friends, you will have more causes for
lamentation; and the same also if you take an affection
for another country. Why then do you live to surround
yourself with other sorrows upon sorrows through which
you are unhappy? Then, I ask you, do you call this
affection? What affection, man! If it is a good thing, it
is the cause of no evil: if it is bad, I have nothing to do
with it. I am formed by nature for my own good: I am.
not formed for my own evil.</p>
<p>What then is the discipline for this purpose? First of
all the highest and the principal, and that which stands as
it were at the entrance, is this; when you are delighted
with anything, be delighted as with a thing which is not
<pb n="281"/>
one of those which cannot be taken away, but as with
something of such a kind, as an earthen pot is, or a glass
cup, that when it has been broken, you may remember
what it was, and may not be troubled. So in this matter
also: if you kiss your own child, or your brother or friend,
never give full license to the appearance (<foreign lang="greek">fantasi/an</foreign>), and
allow not your pleasure to go as far as it chooses; but
check it, and curb it as those who stand behind men in
their triumphs and remind them that they are mortal.<note anchored="yes">It was the custom in Roman triumphs for a slave to stand behind
the triumphant general in his chariot and to remind him that he was
still mortal. Juvenal, x. 41.</note>
Do you also remind yourself in like manner, that he whom
you love is mortal, and that what you love is nothing of
your own: it has been given to you for the present, not
that it should not be taken from you, nor has it been given
to you for all time, but as a fig is given to you or a bunch
of grapes at the appointed season of the year. But if you
wish for these things in winter, you are a fool. So if you
wish for your son or friend when it is not allowed to
you, you must know that you are wishing for a fig in
winter.<note anchored="yes">Compare Antoninus xi. 33 and 34.</note> For such as winter is to a fig, such is every
event which happens from the universe to the things
which are taken away according to its nature. And
further, at the times when you are delighted with a thing,
place before yourself the contrary appearances. What
harm is it while you are kissing your child to say with a
lisping voice, To-morrow you will die; and to a friend
also, To-morrow you will go away or I shall, and never
shall we see one another again?&mdash;But these are words of
bad omen&mdash;And some incantations also are of bad omen;
but because they are useful, I don't care for this; only let
them be useful. But do you call things to be of bad omen
except those which are significant of some evil? Cowardice
is a word of bad omen, and meanness of spirit, and sorrow,
and grief and shamelessness. These words are of bad
omen: and yet we ought not to hesitate to utter them in
order to protect ourselves against the things. Do you tell
me that a name which is significant of any natural thing
is of evil omen? say that even for the ears of corn to be
<pb n="282"/>
reaped is of bad omen, for it signifies the destruction of
the ears, but not of the world. Say that the falling of
the leaves also is of bad omen, and for the dried fig to
take the place of the green fig, and for raisins to be made
from the grapes. For all these things are changes from a
former state into other states; not a destruction, but a
certain fixed economy and administration. Such is going
away from home and a small change: such is death, a
greater change, not from the state which now is to that
which is not, but to that which is not now.<note anchored="yes">Marcus Antoninus, xi. 35. Compare Epict., iii. 13, 14, and iv.

you also came into existence not when you chose, but
when the world had need of you.<note anchored="yes">I am not sure if Epictetus ever uses <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos</foreign> in the sense of 'Uni-
verse,' the' universum' of philosophers. I think he sometimes uses it in
the common sense of the world, the earth and all that is on it. Epictetus
appears to teach that when a man dies, his existence is terminated.
The body is resolved into the elements of which it is formed, and these
elements are employed for other purposes. Consistently with this
doctrine he may have supposed that the powers, which we call rational
and intellectual, exist in man by virtue only of the organisation of his
brain which is superior to that of all other animals; and that what
we name the soul has no existence independent of the body. It was
an old Greek hypothesis that at death the body returned to earth from
which it came, and the soul (<foreign lang="greek">pneu=ma</foreign>) returned to the regions above,
from which it came. I cannot discover any passage in Epictetus in
which the doctrine is taught that the soul has an existence indepen-
dent of the body. The opinions of Marcus Antoninus on this matter are
contained in his book, iv. 14, 21, and perhaps elsewhere: but they are
rather obscure. A recent writer has attempted to settle the question
of the existence of departed souls by affirming that we can find no place for them either in heaven or in hell; for the modern scientific
notion, as I suppose that it must be named, does not admit the conception of a place heaven or a place hell (Strauss, Der Alte und der
Neue Glaube, p. 129).
<p>We may name Paul a contemporary of Epictetus, for though Epictetus
may have been the younger, he was living at Rome during Nero's reign
(A. D. 54&ndash;68); and it is affirmed, whether correctly or not, I do not
undertake to say, that Paul wrote from Ephesus his first epistle to the
Corinthians (Cor. i. 16, 8) in the beginning of A. D. <date value="56">56</date>. Epictetus, it is
said, lived in Rome till the time of the expulsion of the philosophers
by Domitian, when he retired to Nicopolis an old man, and taught
there. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians (c. 15) contains his
doctrine of the resurrection, which is accepted, I believe, by all, or
nearly all, if there are any exceptions, who profess the Christian faith:
but it is not understood by all in the same way.</p>
<p>Paul teaches that Christ died for our sins, that he was buried and
rose again on the third day; and that after his resurrection he was
seen by many persons. Then he asks, if Christ rose from the dead, how
can some say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 'But if there
be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen' (v. 13); and
(v. 19), 'if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
most miserable.' But he affirms again (v. 20) that 'Christ is risen and
become the first fruits of them that slept.' In v. 32, he asks what
advantages he has from his struggles in Ephesus, 'if the dead rise
not: let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' He seems not to
admit the value of life, if there is no resurrection of the dead; and he
seems to say that we shall seek or ought to seek only the pleasures of
sense, because life is short, if we do not believe in a resurrection of
the dead. It may be added that there is not any direct assertion in
this chapter that Christ ascended to heaven in a bodily form, or that
he ascended to heaven in any way. He then says (v. 35), 'But some
man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do
they come?' He answers this question (v. 36),' Thou fool, that which
thou sowest is not quickened except it die': and he adds that 'God
giveth it (the seed) a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed
his own body.' We all know that the body, which is produced from
the seed, is not the body 'that shall be:' and we also know that the
seed which is sown does not die, and that if the seed died, no body
would be produced from such seed. His conclusion is that the dead
'is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body' (<foreign lang="greek">sw=ma pneumatiko/n</foreign>). I believe that the commentators do not agree about this
'spiritual body': but it seems plain that Paul did not teach that the
body which will rise will be the same as the body which is buried. He
says (v. 50) that 'flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.'
Yet in the Apostles' Creed we pronounce our belief in the 'resurrection of the body': but in the Nicene Creed it is said we look 'for
the resurrection of the dead,' which is a different thing or may have a different meaning from 'the resurrection of the body.' In the ministration of baptism to such as are of riper years, the person to be
baptized is asked 'Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty,' etc. in
the terms of the Church Creeds, but in place of the resurrection of the
body or of the dead, he is asked if he believes 'in the resurrection of
the flesh.'</p>
<p>The various opinions of divines of the English church on the
resurrection of the body are stated by A. Clissold in the 'Practical
Nature of the Theological Writings of E. Swedenborg in a letter to

<pb n="283"/></p>
<p>Wherefore the wise and good man, remembering who he
is and whence he came, and by whom he was produced, is
<pb n="284"/>
attentive only to this, how he may fill his place with due
regularity, and obediently to God. Dost thou still wish
me to exist (live)? I will continue to exist as free, as
noble in nature, as thou hast wished me to exist: for
thou hast made me free from hindrance in that which is
my own. But hast thou no further need of me? I thank
thee; and so far I have remained for thy sake, and for the
sake of no other person, and now in obedience to thee I
depart. How dost thou depart? Again, I say, as thou
hast pleased, as free, as thy servant, as one who has known
thy commands and thy prohibitions. And so long as I
shall stay in thy service, whom dost thou will me to be?
A prince or a private man, a senator or a common person,
a soldier or a general, a teacher or a master of a family?
whatever place and position thou mayest assign to me, as
Socrates says, I will die ten thousand times rather than
desert them. And where dost thou will me to be? in
Rome or Athens, or Thebes or Gyara. Only remember me
there where I am. If thou sendest me to a place where
there are no means for men living according to nature, I
shall not depart (from life) in disobedience to thee, but as
if thou wast giving me the signal to retreat: I do not
leave thee, let this be far from my intention, but I perceive that thou hast no need of me. If means of living
according to nature be allowed to me, I will seek no other
place than that in which I am, or other men than those
among whom I am.</p>
<p>Let these thoughts be ready to hand by night and by
day: these you should write, these you should read: about
these you should talk to yourself, and to others. Ask a
man, Can you help me at all for this purpose? and further,
go to another and to another. Then if any thing that is
<pb n="285"/>
said be contrary to your wish, this reflection first will im-
mediately relieve you, that it is not unexpected. For it is
a great thing in all cases to say, I knew that I begot a
son who is mortal.<note anchored="yes">Seneca de Consol. ad Pol. c. 30; Cicero, Tuscul. Disp. iii. 13.</note> For so you also will say, I knew that
I am mortal, I knew that I may leave my home, I knew
that I may be ejected from it, I knew that I may be led to
prison. Then if you turn round and look to yourself, and
seek the place from which comes that which has happened,
you will forthwith recollect that it comes from the place
of things which are out of the power of the will, and of
things which are not my own. What then is it to me?
Then, you will ask, and this is the chief thing: And who
is it that sent it? The leader, or the general, the state,
the law of the state. Give it me then, for I must always
obey the law in every thing. Then, when the appearance
(of things) pains you, for it is not in your power to
prevent this, contend against it by the aid of reason,
conquer it: do not allow it to gain strength nor to lead
you to the consequences by raising images such as it
pleases and as it pleases. If you be in Gyara, do not
imagine the mode of living at Rome, and how many pleasures there were for him who lived there and how many
there would be for him who returned to Rome: but fix
your mind on this matter, how a man who lives in Gyara
ought to live in Gyara like a man of courage. And if you
be in Rome, do not imagine what the life in Athens is, but
think only of the life in Rome.</p>
<p>Then in the place of all other delights substitute this,
that of being conscious that you are obeying God, that not
in word, but in deed you are performing the acts of a wise
and good man. For what a thing it is for a man to be
able to say to himself, Now whatever the rest may say in
solemn manner in the schools and may be judged to be
saying in a way contrary to common opinion (or in a
strange way), this I am doing; and they are sitting and
are discoursing of my virtues and inquiring about me and
praising me; and of this Zeus has willed that I shall receive
from myself a demonstration, and shall myself know if he
has a soldier such as he ought to have, a citizen such as
<pb n="286"/>
he ought to have, and if he has chosen to produce me to
the rest of mankind as a witness of the things which are
independent of the will: See that you fear without reason,
that you foolishly desire what you do desire: seek not the
good in things external; seek it in yourselves: if you do not,
you will not find it. For this purpose he leads me at one
time hither, at another time sends me thither, shows me
to men as poor, without authority, and sick; sends me to
Gyara, leads me into prison, not because he hates me, far
from him be such a meaning, for who hates the best of his
servants? nor yet because he cares not for me, for he does
not neglect any even of the smallest things;<note anchored="yes">Compare i. 12. 2, ii. 14. 11, iii. 26. 28. 'Compare this with the
description of the universal care of Providence, Matthew, x. 29, 30, and

does this for the purpose of exercising me and making use
of me as a witness to others. Being appointed to such a
service, do I still care about the place in which I am, or
with whom I am, or what men say about me? and do 1
not entirely direct my thoughts to God and to his instructions and commands?</p>
<p>Having these things (or thoughts) always in hand, and
exercising them by yourself, and keeping them in readiness,
you will never be in want of one to comfort you and
strengthen you. For it is not shameful to be without
something to eat, but not to have reason sufficient for
keeping away fear and sorrow. But if once you have
gained exemption from sorrow and fear, will there any
longer be a tyrant for you, or a tyrant's guard, or atten-
dants on Caesar?<note anchored="yes">See i. 19. 19.</note> Or shall any appointment to offices at

when we are engaged in the greatest combat, but we must
even take blows.<note anchored="yes">Compare iii. 15, 4.</note> For the combat before us is not in wrestling and the Pancration, in which both the successful and
the unsuccessful may have the greatest merit, or may have
little, and in truth may be very fortunate or very unfortunate; but the combat is for good fortune and happiness
themselves. Well then, even if we have renounced the
contest in this matter (for good fortune and happiness), no
man hinders us from renewing the combat again, and we
are not compelled to wait for another four years that the
games at Olympia may come again<note anchored="yes">These games were celebrated once in four years.</note>; but as soon as you
have recovered and restored yourself, and employ the
same zeal, you may renew the combat again; and if again
you renounce it, you may again renew it; and if you once
gain the victory, you are like him who has never renounced
the combat. Only do not through a habit of doing the
same thing (renouncing the combat) begin to do it with
pleasure, and then like a bad athlete go about after being
conquered in all the circuit of the games like quails who
have run away.<note anchored="yes">All the circuit of the games' means the circuit of the Pythian,

in these four games victoriously was named Periodonices, or Periodeutes. Upton.
<p>The Greeks used to put quails in a cockpit, as those who are old
enough may remember that we used to put game cocks to fight with
one another. Schweighaeuser describes a way of trying the courage
of these quails from Pollux (ix. 109); but I suppose that the birds
fought also with one another.</p></note></p>
<p>The sight of a beautiful young girl overpowers me. Well,
<pb n="288"/>
have I not been overpowered before? An inclination arises
in me to find fault with a person; for have I not found fault
with him before? You speak to us as if you had come off
(from these things) free from harm, just as if a man should
say to his physician who forbids him to bathe, Have I not
bathed before? If then the physician can say to him, Well,
and what then happened to you after the bath? Had you
not a fever, had you not a headache? And when you found
fault with a person lately, did you not do the act of a
malignant person, of a trifling babbler; did you not cherish
this habit in you by adding to it the corresponding acts?
And when you were overpowered by the young girl, did
you come off unharmed? Why then do you talk of what you
did before? You ought, I think, remembering what you
did, as slaves remember the blows which they have received,
to abstain from the same faults. But the one case is not
like the other; for in the case of slaves the pain causes the
remembrance: but in the case of your faults, what is the
pain, what is the punishment; for when have you been
accustomed to fly from evil acts?<note anchored="yes">Upton supposed that the words '<foreign lang="greek">*all' ou)x o(/moion</foreign> . . . . to <foreign lang="greek">kakw=s e)nergh=sai</foreign>, in the translation, 'But the one case is not, . . . to 'fly
from evil acts,' are said by the adversary of Epictetus, and Mrs. Carter
has followed Upton in the translation. But then there is no sense in
the last sentence <foreign lang="greek">*oi( po/noi a)/ra</foreign> etc., in the translation, 'Sufferings
then' etc. The reader may consult Schweighaeuser's note. I suppose
that Epictetus is speaking the words 'But the one case' etc. to the
end of the chapter. The adversary, who is not punished like a slave,
and has no pains to remind him of his faults, is supposed so far not
to have felt the consequences of his bad acts; but Epictetus concludes
that sufferings of a painful character would be useful to him, as they
are to all persons who do what they ought not to do. There is perhaps
some difficulty in the word <foreign lang="greek">peirathri/wn</foreign>. But I think that Schweig.
has correctly explained the passage.</note> Sufferings then of the
trying character are useful to us, whether we choose
or not.

thought for your life, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink' etc.
No Christian literally follows the advice of this and the following
verses, and he would be condemned by the judgment of all men if
he did.</note>
<p>ARE you not ashamed at being more cowardly and more
mean than fugitive slaves? How do they when they run
away leave their masters? on what estates do they depend,
and what domestics do they rely on? Do they not after
stealing a little which is enough for the first days, then
afterwards move on through land or through sea, contriving
one method after another for maintaining their lives? And
what fugitive slave ever died of hunger?<note anchored="yes">It is very absurd to suppose that no fugitive slave ever died of
hunger. How could Epictetus know that?</note> But you are
afraid lest necessary things should fail you, and are sleepless by night. Wretch, are you so blind, and don't you see
the road to which the want of necessaries leads?&mdash;Well,
where does it lead?&mdash;To the same place to which a fever
leads, or a stone that falls on you, to death. Have you not
often said this yourself to your companions? have you not
read much of this kind, and written much? and how often
have you boasted that you were easy as to death?</p>
<p>Yes: but my wife and children also suffer hunger.<note anchored="yes">He supposes that the man who is dying of hunger has also wife
and children, who will suffer the same dreadful end. The consolation,
if it is any, is that the rich and luxurious and kings will also die.
The fact is true. Death is the lot of all. But a painful death by
hunger cannot be alleviated by a man knowing that all must die in
some way. It seems as if the philosopher expected that even women
and children should be philosophers, and that the husband in his
philosophy should calmly contemplate the death of wife and children
by starvation. This is an example of the absurdity t? which even a
wise man carried his philosophy; and it is unworthy of the teacher's
general good sense.</note>&mdash;Well
then, does their hunger lead to any other place? Is there
not the same descent to some place for them also? Is not
<pb n="290"/>
there the same state below for them? Do you not choose
then to look to that place full of boldness against every
want and deficiency, to that place to which both the richest
and those who have held the highest offices, and kings themselves and tyrants must descend? or to which you will
descend hungry, if it should so happen, but they burst by
indigestion and drunkenness. What beggar did you hardly
ever see who was not an old man, and even of extreme old
age? But chilled with cold day and night, and lying on
the ground, and eating only what is absolutely necessary
they approach near to the impossibility of dying.<note anchored="yes">We see many old beggars who endure what others could not
endure; but they all die at last, and would have died earlier if their
beggar life had begun sooner. The living in the open air and wandering about help them to last longer; but the exposure to cold and wet
and to the want of food hastens their end. The life of a poor old
beggar is neither so long nor so comfortable as that of a man, who has
a good home and sufficient food, and lives with moderation.</note> Cannot
you write? Cannot you teach (take care of) children?
Cannot you be a watchman at another person's door?&mdash;But
it is shameful to come to such a necessity.&mdash;Learn then
first what are the things which are shameful, and then tell
us that you are a philosopher: but at present do not, even
if any other man call you so, allow it.</p>
<p>Is that shameful to you which is not your own act, that
of which you are not the cause, that which has come to you
by accident, as a headache, as a fever? If your parents
were poor, and left their property to others, and if while
they live, they do not help you at all, is this shameful to
you? Is this what you learned with the philosophers? Did
you never hear that the thing which is shameful ought to
be blamed, and that which is blameable is worthy of blame?
Whom do you blame for an act which is not his own, which
he did not do himself? Did you then make your father such
as he is, or is it in your power to improve him? Is this
power given to you? Well then, ought you to wish the
things which are not given to you, or to be ashamed if you
do not obtain them? And have you also been accustomed
awhile you were studying philosophy to look to others and
to hope for nothing from yourself? Lament then and groan
and eat with fear that you may not have food to-morrow.

Tremble about your poor slaves lest they steal, lest they
run away, lest they die. So live, and continue to live, you
who in name only have approached philosophy, and have
disgraced its theorems as far as you can by showing them
to be useless and unprofitable to those who take them up;
you who have never sought constancy, freedom from perturbation, and from passions: you who have not sought any
person for the sake of this object, but many for the sake of
syllogisms; you who have never thoroughly examined any
of these appearances by yourself, Am I able to bear, or am
I not able to bear? What remains for me to do? But as if
all your affairs were well and secure, you have been resting
on the third topic,<note anchored="yes">See iii. c. 2.</note> that of things being unchanged, in order
that you may possess unchanged&mdash;what? cowardice, mean
spirit, the admiration of the rich, desire without attaining
any end, and avoidance (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisin</foreign>) which fails in the

measure, slave; but it is not the thing measured. Therefore you are now paying the penalty for what you neglected,
philosophy: you tremble, you lie awake, you advise with
all persons; and if your deliberations are not likely to
please all, you think that you have deliberated ill. Then
you fear hunger, as you suppose: but it is not hunger
that you fear, but you are afraid that you will not have a
cook, that you will not have another to purchase provisions
for the table, a third to take off your shoes, a fourth to dress
you, others to rub you, and to follow you, in order that in
the bath, when you have taken off your clothes and
stretched yourself out like those who are crucified you may
be rubbed on this side and on that, and then the aliptes
(rubber) may say (to the slave), Change his position,
present the side, take hold of his head, shew the shoulder;
and then when you have left the bath and gone home, you
may call out, Does no one bring something to eat? And
then, Take away the tables, sponge them: you are afraid of
this, that you may not be able to lead the life of a sick
man. But learn the life of those who are in health, how
slaves live, how labourers, how those live who are genuine
philosophers; how Socrates lived, who had a wife and children; how Diogenes lived, and how Cleanthes<note anchored="yes">'Cleanthes, the successor of Zeno in his school, was a great
example of the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties: during the
night he used to draw water from the wells for the use of the gardens:
during the day he employed himself in his studies. He was the
author of a noble hymn to Zeus, which is extant,</note> who attended to the school and drew water. If you choose to have
these things, you will have them every where, and you
will live in full confidence. Confiding in what? In that
alone in which a man can confide, in that which is secure, in
that which is not subject to hindrance, in that which cannot
be taken away, that is, in your own will. And why have you
made yourself so useless and good for nothing that no man
will choose to receive you into his house, no man to take care
of you?: but if a utensil entire and useful were cast abroad,
every man who found it, would take it up and think it a gain;
but no man will take you up, and every man will consider
you a loss. So cannot you discharge the office even of a dog,
<pb n="293"/>
or of a cock? Why then do you choose to live any longer,
when you are what you are?</p>
<p>Does any good man fear that he shall fail to have food?
To the blind it does not fail, to the lame it does not: shall
it fail to a good man? And to a good soldier there does
not fail to be one who gives him pay, nor to a labourer,
nor to a shoemaker: and to the good man shall there be
wanting such a person?<note anchored="yes">It seems strange that Epictetus should make such assertions
when we know that they are not true. Shortly after he himself speaks
even of the good man not being supplied with food by God.</note> Does God thus neglect the
things that he has established, his ministers, his witnesses,
whom alone he employs as examples to the uninstructed,
both that he exists, and administers well the whole, and
does not neglect human affairs, and that to a good man
there is no evil either when he is living or when he is
dead? What then when he does not supply him with

laboured, and was exercised. And Eurystheus was what

<p>Relying on what? Not on reputation nor on wealth nor
on the power of a magistrate, but on his own strength,
that is, on his opinions about the things which are in our
power and those which are not. For these are the only
things which make men free, which make them escape
from hindrance, which raise the head (neck) of those who
are depressed, which make them look with steady eyes on
the rich and on tyrants. And this was (is) the gift given to
the philosopher. But you will not come forth bold, but

<p>If then a man who has been twice consul should hear
this, if you add, But you are a wise man; this is nothing

truth, and say, You differ not at all from those who have
been thrice sold as to being yourself not a slave, what else
ought you to expect than blows? For he says, What, I a

slave, I whose father was free, whose mother was free
I whom no man can purchase: I am also of senatorial
rank, and a friend of Caesar, and I have been a consul,
and I own many slaves.&mdash;In the first place, most excellent senatorial man, perhaps your father also was a slave
in the same kind of servitude, and your mother, and your
grandfather and all your ancestors in an ascending series.
But even if they were as free as it is possible, what is this
to you? What if they were of a noble nature, and you of
a mean nature; if they were fearless, and you a coward;
if they had the power of self-restraint, and you are not
able to exercise it.</p>
<p>And what, you may say, has this to do with being a
slave? Does it seem to you to be nothing to do a thing unwillingly, with compulsion, with groans, has this nothing
to do with being a slave? It is something, you say: but
who is able to compel me, except the lord of all, Caesar?
Then even you yourself have admitted that you have one
master. But that he is the common master of all, as you
say, let not this console you at all: but know that you
are a slave in a great family. So also the people of
Nicopolis are used to exclaim, By the fortune of Caesar,<note anchored="yes">A usual form of oath. See ii. 20. 29. Upton compares the Roman

respect to being a slave or free? Were you never commanded by the person beloved to do something which you
did not wish to do? have you never flattered your little
slave? have you never kissed her feet? And yet if any
man compelled you to kiss Caesar's feet, you would think
it an insult and excessive tyranny. What else then is
slavery? Did you never go oat by night to some place
whither you did not wish to go, did you not expend that

seen so much military service as perhaps not even you
have, first of all went out by night, when Geta (a slave)
does not venture out, but if he were compelled by his
master, would have cried out much and would have gone
out lamenting his bitter slavery. Next, what does Thrasonides say? A worthless girl has enslaved me, me whom
no enemy ever did. Unhappy man, who are the slave even
of a girl, and a worthless girl. Why then do you still call
yourself free? and why do you talk of your service in the
army? Then he calls for a sword and is angry with him
who out of kindness refuses it; and he sends presents to
her who hates him, and intreats and weeps, and on the
other hand having had a little success he is elated. But
even then how? was he free enough neither to desire
nor to fear?</p>
<p>Now consider in the case of animals, how we employ
the notion of liberty. Men keep tame lions shut up, and
feed them, and some take them about; and who will say
that this lion is free?<note anchored="yes">It must have been rather difficult to manage a tame lion; but we
read of such things among the Romans. Seneca, Epp. 41.</note> Is it not the fact that the more
he lives at his ease, so much the more he is in a slavish
condition? and who if he had perception and reason would
wish to be one of these lions? Well, these birds when
they are caught and are kept shut up, how much do they
suffer in their attempts to escape?<note anchored="yes">The keeping of birds in cages, parrots and others, was also common
among the Romans. Ovid (<bibl n="Ov. Am. 2.6">Amor. ii. 6</bibl>) has written a beautiful elegy

of hunger rather than submit to such a kind of life. And
as many of them as live, hardly live and with suffering pine

to be independent and free from hindrance. And what
harm is there to you in this? What do you say? I am
formed by nature to fly where I choose, to live in the
open air, to sing when I choose: you deprive me of all
this, and say, what harm is it to you? For this reason
we shall say that those animals only are free, which
cannot endure capture, but as soon as they are caught.
escape from captivity by death. So Diogenes also somewhere says that there is only one way to freedom, and
that is to die content: and he writes to the Persian king.
You cannot enslave the Athenian state any more than you
can enslave fishes. How is that? cannot I catch them?
If you catch them, says Diogenes, they will immediately
leave you, as fishes do; for if you catch a fish, it dies; and
if these men that are caught shall die, of what use to you
is the preparation for war? These are the words of a
free man who had carefully examined the thing, and, as
was natural, had discovered it. But if you look for it in
a different place from where it is, what wonder if you
never find it?</p>
<p>The slave wishes to be set free immediately. Why?
Do you think that he wishes to pay money to the collectors of twentieths?<note anchored="yes">See ii. 1. 26. The <foreign lang="greek">ei)kostw/nai</foreign> were the Publicani, men who
farmed this and other taxes. A tax of a twentieth of the value of a

It appears from this passage that the manumitted slave paid the tax
out of his savings (peculium). See ii. 1. note 7.</note> No; but because he imagines that
hitherto through not having obtained this, he is hindered
and unfortunate. If I shall be set free, immediately it is
all happiness, I care for no man, I speak to all as an equal
and like to them, I go where I choose, I come from any
place I choose, and go where I choose. Then he is set
free; and forthwith having no place where he can eat, he
looks for some man to flatter, some one with whom he
shall sup: then he either works with his body and endures the most dreadful things;<note anchored="yes">The reader may guess the meaning.</note> and if he can obtain a

slavery; or even if he is become rich, being a man with-
out any knowledge of what is good, he loves some little
girl, and in his unhappiness laments and desires to be a
slave again. He says, what evil did I suffer in my state
of slavery? Another clothed me, another supplied me
with shoes, another fed me, another looked after me in
sickness; and I did only a few services for him. But
now a wretched man, what things I suffer, being a slave
to many instead of to one. But however, he says, if I
shall acquire rings<note anchored="yes">A gold ring was worn by the Equites; and accordingly to desire the

and happily. First, in order to acquire these rings, he
submits to that which he is worthy of; then when he has
acquired them, it is again all the same. Then he says,
If I shall be engaged in military service, I am free from
all evils. He obtains military service. He suffers as much
as a flogged slave, and nevertheless he asks for a second
service and a third. After this, when he has put the finishing stroke (the colophon)<note anchored="yes">The colophon. See ii. 14. note 5. After the words 'most splendid

to men of all their evils, the not being able to adapt the

fact is that he does not adapt his preconceptions right.
Another thinks that he is poor; another that he has a
severe father or mother; and another again that Caesar is
not favourable to him. But all this is one and only one
thing, the not knowing how to adapt the preconceptions.
For who has not a preconception of that which is bad,
<pb n="300"/>
that it is hurtful, that it ought to be avoided, that it ought
in every way to be guarded against? One preconception
is not repugnant to another,<note anchored="yes">Compare i. 22</note> only where it comes to the
matter of adaptation. What then is this evil, which is
both hurtful, and a thing to be avoided? He answers
not to be Caesar's friend.&mdash;He is gone far from the mark,
he has missed the adaptation, he is embarrassed, he
seeks the things which are not at all pertinent to the
matter; for when he has succeeded in being Caesar's
friend, never the less he has failed in finding what he
sought. For what is that which every man seeks? To
live secure, to be happy, to do every thing as he wishes,
not to be hindered, nor compelled. When then he is
become the friend of Caesar, is he free from hindrance?
free from compulsion, is he tranquil, is he happy? Of
whom shall we inquire? What more trustworthy witness
have we than this very man who is become Caesar's
friend? Come forward and tell us when did you sleep
more quietly, now or before you became Caesar's friend?
Immediately you hear the answer, Stop, I intreat you, and
do not mock me: you know not what miseries I suffer,
and sleep does not come to me; but one comes and says,
Caesar is already awake, he is now going forth: then
come troubles and cares&mdash;Well, when did you sup with
more pleasure, now or before? Hear what he says about
this also. He says that if he is not invited, he is pained:
and if he is invited, he sups like a slave with his master,
all the while being anxious that he does not say or do any
thing foolish. And what do you suppose that he is afraid
of; lest he should be lashed like a slave? How can he
expect any thing so good? No, but as befits so great a
man, Caesar's friend, he is afraid that he may lose his
head. And when did you bathe more free from trouble,
and take your gymnastic exercise more quietly? In fine,
which kind of life did you prefer? your present or your
former life? I can swear that no man is so stupid or so
ignorant of truth as not to bewail his own misfortunes the
nearer he is in friendship to Caesar.
<pb n="301"/>
Since then neither those who are called kings live as
they choose, nor the friends of kings, who finally are
those who are free? Seek, and you will find; for you
have aids from nature for the discovery of truth. But if
you are not able yourself by going along these ways only
to discover that which follows, listen to those who have
made the inquiry. What do they say? Does freedom
seem to you a good thing? The greatest good. Is it
possible then that he who obtains the greatest good can be
unhappy or fare badly? No. Whomsoever then you
shall see unhappy, unfortunate, lamenting, confidently
declare that they are not free. I do declare it. We have
now then got away from buying and selling and from such
arrangements about matters of property: for if you have
rightly assented to these matters, if the great king (the
Persian king) is unhappy, he cannot be free, nor can a
little king, nor a man of consular rank, nor one who has
been twice consul.&mdash;Be it so.</p>
<p>Further then answer me this question also, does freedom
seem to you to be something great and noble and valuable?&mdash;How should it not seem so? Is it possible then
when a man obtains anything so great and valuable and
noble to be mean?&mdash;It is not possible&mdash;When then you see
any man subject to another or flattering him contrary to
his own opinion, confidently affirm that this man also is
not free; and not only if he do this for a bit of supper,
but also if he does it for a government (province) or a
consulship: and call these men little slaves who for the
sake of little matters do these things, and those who do so
for the sake of great things call great slaves, as they
deserve to be.&mdash;This is admitted also&mdash;Do you think that
freedom is a thing independent and self governing?&mdash;
Certainly&mdash;Whomsoever then it is in the power of another
to hinder and compel, declare that he is not free. And do
not look, I intreat you, after his grandfathers and great
grandfathers, or inquire about his being bought or sold;
but if you hear him saying from his heart and with
feeling, 'Master,' even if the twelve fasces precede him (as
consul), call him a slave. And if you hear him say,
'Wretch that I am, how much I suffer,' call him a slave.
If finally you see him lamenting, complaining, unhappy,
<pb n="302"/>
call him a slave though he wears a praetexta.<note anchored="yes">Sic praetextatos referunt Artaxata mores.&mdash;Juv. ii. 170.
See Epict. i. 2, note 4.</note> If then he
is doing nothing of this kind, do not yet say that he is
free, but learn his opinions, whether they are subject to
compulsion, or may produce hindrance, or to bad fortune;
and if you find him such, call him a slave who has a holiday in the Saturnalia:<note anchored="yes">Saturnalia. See i. 25, note 3.
<p>At this season the slaves had liberty to enjoy themselves and to talk
freely with their masters. Hence Horace says, <cit><bibl n="Hor. S. 2.74">Sat. ii. 74&mdash;</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>Age. libertate Decembri,</l>
<l>Quando ita majores voluerunt, utere.</l></lg></quote></cit></p></note> say that his master is from
home: he will return soon, and you will know what he
suffers. Who will return? Whoever has in himself the
power over anything which is desired by the man, either
to give it to him or to take it away? Thus then have we
many masters? We have: for we have circumstances as
masters prior to our present masters; and these circumstances are many. Therefore it must of necessity be that
those who have the power over any of these circumstances
must be our masters. For no man fears Caesar himself,
but he fears death, banishment, deprivation of his property, prison, and disgrace. Nor does any man love
Caesar, unless Caesar is a person of great merit, but he
loves wealth, the office of tribune, praetor or consul. When
we love, and hate and fear these things, it must be that
those who have the power over them must be our masters.
Therefore we adore them even as gods; for we think that
what possesses the power of conferring the greatest
advantage on us is divine. Then we wrongly assume
(<foreign lang="greek">u(pota/ssomen</foreign>) that a certain person has the power of conferring the greatest advantages; therefore he is something
divine. For if we wrongly assume<note anchored="yes"><quote>Insigne hoc exemplum est <foreign lang="greek">tou= ei)kh= ta\s prolh/yeis e)farmo/zein tai=s 'pi me/rous ou)si/ais</foreign>.
De quo, vide i. 22, 9, ii. 11, 3, ii. 17, 7.</quote> Upton.</note> that a certain person
has the power of conferring the greatest advantages, it is
a necessary consequence that the conclusion from these
premises must be false.</p>
<p>What then is that which makes a man free from
hindrance and makes him his own master? For wealth
does not do it, nor consulship, nor provincial government,
<pb n="303"/>
nor royal power; but something else must be discovered.
What then is that which when we write makes us free from
hindrance and unimpeded? The knowledge of the art of
writing. What then is it in playing the lute? The
science of playing the lute. Therefore in life also it is the
science of life. You have then heard in a general way:
but examine the thing also in the several parts. Is it
possible that he who desires any of the things which
depend on others can be free from hindrance? No&mdash;Is it
possible for him to be unimpeded? No&mdash;Therefore he
cannot be free. Consider then: whether we have nothing
which is in our own power only, or whether we have all
things, or whether some things are in our own power, and
others in the power of others.&mdash;What do you mean?&mdash;
When you wish the body to be entire (sound), is it in
your power or not?&mdash;It is not in my power&mdash;When you
wish it to be healthy?&mdash;Neither is this in my power.&mdash;
When you wish it to be handsome?&mdash;Nor is this&mdash;Life or
death?&mdash;Neither is this in my power.<note anchored="yes">Schweighaeuser observes that death is in our power, as the Stoics
taught; and Epictetus often tells us that the door is open. He suggests
that the true reading may be <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ou)k a)poqanei=n</foreign>. I think that the text
is right. Epictetus asks is 'Life or death' in our power. He means
no more than if he had said Life only.</note>&mdash;Your body then
is another's, subject to every man who is stronger than
yourself&mdash;It is&mdash;But your estate, is it in your power to
have it when you please, and as long as you please, and
such as you please?&mdash;No&mdash;And your slaves?&mdash;No&mdash;And
your clothes?&mdash;No&mdash;And your house?&mdash;No&mdash;And your
horses?&mdash;Not one of these things&mdash;And if you wish by all
means your children to live, or your wife, or your brother,
or your friends, is it in your power?&mdash;This also is not in
my power.</p>
<p>Whether then have you nothing which is in your own
power, which depends on yourself only and cannot be
taken from you, or have you any thing of the kind?&mdash;I
know not&mdash;Look at the thing then thus, and examine it.
Is any man able to make you assent to that which is
false<note anchored="yes">He means that which seems to you to be false. See iii. 22, 42.
<p><quote>In the matter of assent then</quote>: this is the third <foreign lang="greek">to/ros</foreign> or 'locus' or
division in philosophy (iii. 2, 1&ndash;5). As to the Will, compare i. 17, note 10. Epictetus affirms that a man cannot be compelled to assent, that is
to admit, to allow, or, to use another word, to believe in that which seems
to him to be false, or, to use the same word again, to believe in that in
which he does not believe. When the Christian uses the two creeds,
which begin with the words, 'I believe etc.,' he knows or he ought to
know, that he cannot compel an unbeliever to accept the same belief.
He may by pains and penalties of various kinds compel some persons
to profess or to express the same belief: but as no pains or penalties
could compel some Christians to deny their belief, so I suppose that
perhaps there are men who could not be compelled to express this
belief when they have it not. The case of the believer and the unbeliever however are not the same. The believer may be strengthened
in his belief by the belief that he will in some way be punished by God,
if he denies that which he believes. The unbeliever will not have the
same motive or reason for not expressing his assent to that which he
does not believe. He believes that it is and will be all the same to
him with respect to God, whether he gives his assent to that which he
does not believe or refuses his assent. There remains nothing then to
trouble him if he expresses his assent to that which he does not believe,
except the opinion of those who know that he does not believe, or his
own reflections on expressing his assent to that which he does not
believe; or in other words his publication of a lie, which may probably
do no harm to any man or in any way. I believe that some men are
strong enough, under some circumstances at least, to refuse their assent
to any thing which they do not believe; but I do not affirm that they
would do this under all circumstances.</p>
<p>To return to the matter under consideration, a man cannot be compelled by any power to accept voluntarily a thing as true, when lie
believes that it is not true; and this act of his is quite independent of
the matter whether his unbelief is well founded or not. He does not
believe because he cannot believe. Yet it is said (Mark xvi. 11,) in
the received text, as it now stands, 'He that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned' (condemned).
The cause, as it is called, of this unbelief is explained by some theolo-
gians; but all men do not admit the explanation to be sufficient: and
it does not concern the present subject.</p></note>&mdash;No man&mdash;In the matter of assent then you are free
<pb n="304"/>
from hindrance and obstruction.&mdash;Granted&mdash;Well; and
can a man force you to desire to move towards that to
which you do not choose?&mdash;He can, for when he threatens
me with death or bonds, he compels me to desire to move
towards it. If then, you despise death and bonds, do you
still pay any regard to him?&mdash;No&mdash;Is then the despising
of death an act of your own or is it not yours?&mdash;It is my
act&mdash;It is your own act then also to desire to move towards
a thing: or is it not so?&mdash;It is my own act&mdash;But to desire
to move away from a thing, whose act is that? This also
is your act&mdash;What then if I have attempted to walk, sup-
<pb n="305"/>
pose another should hinder me&mdash;What part of you does he
hinder? does he hinder the faculty of assent?&mdash;No: but
my poor body&mdash;Yes, as he would do with a stone&mdash;
Granted; but I no longer walk&mdash;And who told you that
walking is your own act free from hindrance? for I said
that this only was free from hindrance, to desire to move:
but where there is need of body and its co-operation, you
have heard long ago that nothing is your own.&mdash;Granted
this also&mdash;And who can compel you to desire what you
do not wish?&mdash;No man&mdash;And to propose or intend, or in
short to make use of the appearances which present themselves, can any man compel you?&mdash;He cannot do this: but
he will hinder me when I desire from obtaining what I
desire.&mdash;If you desire any thing which is your own, and
one of the things which cannot be hindered, how will he
hinder you?&mdash;He cannot in any way&mdash;Who then tells
you that he who desires the things that belong to another
is free from hindrance?</p>
<p>Must I then not desire health? By no means, nor
any thing else that belongs to another: for what is not
in your power to acquire or to keep when you please, this
belongs to another. Keep then far from it not only your
hands, but more than that, even your desires. If you do
not, you have surrendered yourself as a slave; you have
subjected your neck, if you admire<note anchored="yes">The word 'admire' is <foreign lang="greek">qauma/sh|s</foreign> in the original. The word is often
used by Epictetus, and Horace uses <foreign lang="la">'admirari'</foreign> in this Stoical sense.
See i. 29. 2, note.</note> any thing not your
own, to every thing that is dependent on the power of
others and perishable, to which you have conceived a
liking.&mdash;Is not my hand my own?&mdash;It is a part of your
own body;<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note on <foreign lang="greek">me/ros</foreign>.</note> but it is by nature earth, subject to hindrance,
compulsion, and the slave of every thing which is stronger.
And why do I say your hand? You ought to possess your
whole body as a poor ass loaded, as long as it is possible,
as long as you are allowed. But if there be a press,<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">a)ggarei/a</foreign>, a word of Persian origin (Herodotus, viii.
98). It means here the seizure of animals for military purposes when
it is necessary. Upton refers to Matthew 5, v 41, Mark 15, c. 21 for
similar uses of the verb <foreign lang="greek">a)ggareu/w</foreign></note> and
<pb n="306"/>
a soldier should lay hold of it, let it go, do not resist, nor
murmur; if you do, you will receive blows, and never the
less you will also lose the ass. But when you ought to
feel thus with respect to the body, consider what remains
to be done about all the rest, which is provided for the
sake of the body. When the body is an ass, all the other
things are bits belonging to the ass, pack-saddles, shoes,<note anchored="yes">Here he speaks of asses being shod. The Latin translation of the
word (<foreign lang="greek">u(podhma/tia</foreign>) in Epictetus is 'ferreas calces. I suppose they
could use nothing but iron.</note>
barley, fodder. Let these also go: get rid of them quicker
and more readily than of the ass.</p>
<p>When you have made this preparation, and have practised this discipline, to distinguish that which belongs to
another from that which is your own, the things which
are subject to hindrance from those which are not, to consider the things free from hindrance to concern yourself,
and those which are not free not to concern yourself, to
keep your desire steadily fixed to the things which do
concern yourself, and turned from the things which do
not concern yourself; do you still fear any man? No one.
For about what will you be afraid? about the things which
are your own, in which consists the nature of good and
evil? and who has power over these things? who can take
them away? who can impede them? No man can, no more
than he can impede God. But will you be afraid about
your body and your possessions, about things which are
not yours, about things which in no way concern you?
and what else have you been studying from the beginning
than to distinguish between your own and not your own,
the things which are in your power and not in your power,
the things subject to hindrance and not subject? and why
have you come to the philosophers? was it that you may
never the less be unfortunate and unhappy? You will then
in this way, as I have supposed you to have done, be without fear and disturbance. And what is grief to you? for
fear comes from what you expect, but grief from that which
is present.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> But what further will you desire? For of
the things which are within the power of the will, as being
good and present, you have a proper and regulated desire:
<pb n="307"/>
but of the things which are not in the power of the will
you do not desire any one, and so you do not allow any
place to that which is irrational, and impatient, and above
measure hasty.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note></p>
<p>When then you are thus affected towards things, what
man can any longer be formidable to you? For what has
a man which is formidable to another, either when you see
him or speak to him or finally are conversant with him?
Not more than one horse has with respect to another, or
one dog to another, or one bee to another bee. Things
indeed are formidable to every man; and when any man
is able to confer these things on another or to take them
away, then he too becomes formidable. How then is an
acropolis (a stronghold or fortress, the seat of tyranny)
demolished? Not by the sword, not by fire, but by opinion.
For if we abolish the acropolis which is in the city, can we
abolish also that of fever, and that of beautiful women?
Can we in a word abolish the acropolis which is in us and
cast out the tyrants within us,<note anchored="yes">Schweig. suggests <foreign lang="greek">katabeblh/kamen</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">a)pobeblh/kamen</foreign>, though
all his MSS. have the word in the text. I do not think that his proposed
alteration is an improvement.</note> whom we have daily over
us, sometimes the same tyrants, at other times different
tyrants? But with this we must begin, and with this we
must demolish the acropolis and eject the tyrants, by giving
up the body, the parts of it, the faculties of it, the possessions, the reputation, magisterial offices, honours, children,
brothers, friends, by considering all these things as belonging to others. And if tyrants have been ejected from us,
why do I still shut in the acropolis by a wall of circumvallation,<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">a)poteixi/zw</foreign>, which means what I have translated. The
purpose of circumvallation was to take and sometimes also to destroy
a fortress. Schweig. translates the word by 'destruam,' and that is
perhaps not contrary to the meaning of the text; but it is not the exact
meaning of the word.</note> at least on my account; for if it still stands, what
does it do to me? why do I still eject (the tyrant's) guards?
For where do I perceive them? against others they have
their fasces, and their spears and their swords. But I
have never been hindered in my will, nor compelled when
I did not will. And how is this possible? I have placed
<pb n="308"/>
my movements towards action (<foreign lang="greek">o(rmh/n</foreign>) in obedience to
God.<note anchored="yes">In this passage and in what follows we find the emphatic affirmation of the duty of conformity and of the subjection of man's will to the
will of God. The words are conclusive evidence of the doctrine of
Epictetus that a man ought to subject himself in all things to the will
of God or to that which he believes to be the will of God. No Christian
martyr ever proclaimed a more solemn obedience to God's will. The
Christian martyr indeed has given perfect proof of his sincerity by
enduring torments and death: the heathen philosopher was not put to
the same test, and we cannot therefore say that he would have been
able to bear it.</note> Is it his will that I shall have fever? It is my
will also. Is it his will that I should move towards any
thing? It is my will also. Is it his will that I should
obtain any thing? It is my wish also.<note anchored="yes">In this passage the distinction must be observed between <foreign lang="greek">qe/lw</foreign> and
<foreign lang="greek">boulomai</foreign>, which the Latin translators have not observed, nor Mrs.
Carter. See Schweig.'s note on s. 90.</note> Does he not
will? I do not wish. Is it his will that I die, is it his
will that I be put to the rack? It is my will then to die:
it is my will then to be put to the rack. Who then is
still able to hinder me contrary to my own judgment, or to
compel me? No more than he can hinder or compel Zeus.</p>
<p>Thus the more cautious of travellers also act. A traveller
has heard that the road is infested by robbers; he does not
venture to enter on it alone, but he waits for the companionship on the road either of an ambassador, or of a quaestor,
or of a proconsul, and when he has attached himself to such
persons he goes along the road safely. So in the world<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)n tw=| ko/smw|</foreign>: he means 'on earth.'</note>
the wise man acts. There are many companies of robbers,
tyrants, storms, difficulties, losses of that which is dearest.
Where is there any place of refuge? how shall he pass
along without being attacked by robbers? what company
shall he wait for that he may pass along in safety? to whom
shall he attach himself? To what person generally? to
the rich man, to the man of consular rank? and what is
the use of that to me? Such a man is stripped himself,
groans and laments. But what if the fellow companion
himself turns against me and becomes my robber, what
shall I do? I will be a friend of Caesar: when I am Caesar's
companion no man will wrong me. In the first place, that
I may become illustrious, what things must I endure and
<pb n="309"/>
suffer? how often and by how many must I be robbed?
Then, if I become Caesar's friend, he also is mortal. And
if Caesar from any circumstance becomes my enemy, where
is it best for me to retire? Into a desert? Well, does fever
not come there? What shall be done then? Is it not
possible to find a safe fellow traveller, a faithful one, strong,
secure against all surprises? Thus he considers and perceives that if he attaches himself to God, he will make his
journey in safety.</p>
<p>How do you understand 'attaching yourself to God?
In this sense, that whatever God wills, a man also shall
will; and what God does not will, a man also shall not
will. How then shall this be done? In what other way
than by examining the movements (<foreign lang="greek">o(rma/s</foreign>, the acts) of
God<note anchored="yes">Schweig. expresses his surprise that Epictetus has applied this word
(<foreign lang="greek">o(rma/s</foreign>) to God. He says that Wolf has translated it 'Dei appetitionem,'
and Upton 'impetum.' He says that he has translated it 'consilium.'
<p>It is not unusual for men to speak of God in the same words in which
they speak of man.</p></note> and his administration? What has he given to me
as my own and in my own power? what has he reserved
to himself? He has given to me the things which are in
the power of the will (<foreign lang="greek">ta\ proairetika\</foreign>): he has put them
in my power free from impediment and hindrance. How
was he able to make the earthy body free from hindrance?
[He could not], and accordingly he has subjected to the
revolution of the whole (<foreign lang="greek">th=| tw=n o(/lwn perio/dw|</foreign>)<note anchored="yes">See ii. 1. 18. Schweig. expected that Epictetus would have said
'body and possessions etc.' I assume that Epictetus did say 'body and
possessions etc.,' and that his pupil or some copyist of MSS. has omitted
the word 'body.'</note> possessions,
household things, house, children, wife. Why then do I
fight against God? why do I will what does not depend on
the will? why do I will to have absolutely what is not
granted to me? But how ought I to will to have things?
In the way in which they are given and as long as they are
given. But he who has given takes away.<note anchored="yes">'The Lord gave and the Lord lath taken awry. Job i. 21.' Mrs.

do I resist? I do not say that I shall be a fool if I use

<pb n="310"/>
My father gave them to me&mdash;And who gave them to him?
and who made the sun? and who made the fruits of the
earth? and who the seasons? and who made the connection
of men with one another and their fellowship?</p>
<p>Then after receiving everything from another and even
yourself, are you angry and do you blame the giver if he
takes any thing from you? Who are you, and for what
purpose did you come into the world? Did not he (God)
introduce you here, did he not show you the light, did he
not give you fellow workers, and perceptions and reason?
and as whom did he introduce you here? did he not introduce you as subject to death, and as one to live on the
earth with a little flesh, and to observe his administration,
and to join with him in the spectacle and the festival for
a short time? Will you not then, as long as you have
been permitted, after seeing the spectacle and the solemnity,
when he leads you out, go with adoration of him and thanks
for what you have heard and seen?&mdash;No; but I would still
enjoy the feast.&mdash;The initiated too would wish to be longer
in the initiation:<note anchored="yes">The initiated (<foreign lang="greek">mu/stai</foreign>) are those who were introduced with solemn
ceremonies into some great religious body. These ceremonies are described by Dion Prus. Orat. xii., quoted by Upton.</note> and perhaps also those at Olympia to
see other athletes; but the solemnity is ended: go away
like a grateful and modest man; make room for others:
others also must be born, as you were, and being born they
must have a place, and houses and necessary things. And
if the first do not retire, what remains? Why are you insatiable? Why are you not content? why do you contract
the world?&mdash;Yes, but I would have my little children with
me and my wife&mdash;What, are they yours? do they not belong
to the giver, and to him who made you? then will you not
give up what belongs to others? will you not give way to
him who is superior?&mdash;Why then did he introduce me into
the world on these conditions?&mdash;And if the conditions do
not suit you, depart.<note anchored="yes"><quote>And is this all the comfort, every serious reader will be apt to

existence and mingle with the elements of the Universe'! Unspeakably
more rational and more worthy of infinite goodness is our blessed Master's exhortation to the persecuted Christian: 'Rejoice and be
exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven.'</quote> Mrs. Carter.
<p>I do not think that Mrs. Carter has represented correctly the teaching
of Epictetus. He is addressing men who were not Christians, but were,
as he assumes, believers in God or in the Gods, and his argument is
that a man ought to be contented with things as they are, because they
are from God. If he cannot be contented with things as they are, and
make the best of them, the philosopher can say no more to the man. He
tells him to depart. What else could he say to a grumbler, who is also
a believer in God? If he is not a believer, Epictetus might say the
same to him also. The case is past help or advice.</p>
<p>The Christian doctrine, of which probably Epictetus knew nothing, is
very different. It promises future happiness on certain conditions to
Christians, but to Christians only, if I understand it right.</p></note> He has no need of a spectator who
<pb n="311"/>
is not satisfied. He wants those who join in the festival,
those who take part in the chorus, that they may rather
applaud, admire, and celebrate with hymns the solemnity.
But those who can bear no trouble, and the cowardly he
will not unwillingly see absent from the great assembly
(<foreign lang="greek">panh/guris</foreign>); for they did not when they were present behave as they ought to do at a festival nor fill up their place
properly, but they lamented, found fault with the deity,
fortune, their companions; not seeing both what they had,
and their own powers, which they received for contrary
purposes, the powers of magnanimity, of a generous mind,
manly spirit, and what we are now inquiring about, freedom.&mdash;For what purpose then have I received these things?
&mdash;To use them&mdash;How long?&mdash;So long as he who has lent
them chooses.&mdash;What if they are necessary to me?&mdash;Do not
attach yourself to them and they will not be necessary: do

are not necessary.</p>
<p>This study you ought to practise from morning to evening, beginning with the smallest things and those most
liable to damage, with an earthen pot, with a cup. Then
proceed in this way to a tunic, to a little dog, to a horse,
to a small estate in land: then to yourself, to your body,
to the parts of your body, to your children, to your wife, to
your brothers. Look all round and throw these things
from you (which are not yours). Purge your opinions, so
that nothing cleave to you of the things which are not
your own, that nothing grow to you, that nothing give
you pain when it is torn from you;<note anchored="yes">See the note of Schweig. on this passage.</note> and say, while you
<pb n="312"/>
are daily exercising yourself as you do there (in the school),
not that you are philosophizing, for this is an arrogant
(offensive) expression, but that you are presenting an
asserter of freedom:<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">karpi/sthn di/dws</foreign>. See iii. 24.76 and the note 15: also
Upton's note on this passage. Schweig. says that he does not quite
understand why Epictetus here says <foreign lang="greek">dido/nai karpi/sthn</foreign>, 'dare vindicem'
or 'adsertorem,' instead of saying 'vindicate sese in libertatem.'</note> for this is really freedom. To this
freedom Diogenes was called by Antisthenes, and he said
that he could no longer be enslaved by any man. For
this reason when he was taken prisoner,<note anchored="yes">See iii. 24. 66, ii. 13. 24.</note> how did he
behave to the pirates? Did he call any of them master?
and I do not speak of the name, for I am not afraid of the
word, but of the state of mind, by which the word is produced. How did he reprove them for feeding badly their
captives? How was he sold? Did he seek a master? no;
but a slave. And when he was sold how did he behave to
his master?<note anchored="yes">See the same story in Aulus Gellius (<bibl n="Gel. 2.18">ii. c. 18</bibl>), who says that
Xeniades, a Corinthian, bought Diogenes, manumitted him and made
him the master of his children.</note> Immediately he disputed with him and
said to his master that he ought not to be dressed as he
was, nor shaved in such a manner; and about the children
he told them how he ought to bring them up. And what
was strange in this? for if his master had bought an
exercise master, would he have employed him in the exercises of the palaestra as a servant or as a master? and sc
if he had bought a physician or an architect. And so in
every matter, it is absolutely necessary that he who has
skill must be the superior of him who has not. Whoever
then generally possesses the science of life, what else must
he be than master? For who is master in a ship? The
man who governs the helm? Why? Because he who
will not obey him suffers for it. But a master can give
me stripes. Can he do it then without suffering for it? So
I also used to think. But because he cannot do it without
suffering for it, for this reason it is not in his power: and
no man can do what is unjust without suffering for it.
And what is the penalty for him who puts his own slave
in chains?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note 15.</note> what do you think that is? The fact of
putting the slave in chains:&mdash;and you also will admit this,
<pb n="313"/>
if you choose to maintain the truth, that man is not a wild
beast, but a tame animal. For when is a vine doing badly?
When it is in a condition contrary to its nature. When
is a cock? Just the same. Therefore a man also is so.
What then is a man's nature? To bite, to kick, and to
throw into prison and to behead? No; but to do good,
to co-operate with others, to wish them well. At that
time then he is in a bad condition, whether you chose to
admit it or not, when he is acting foolishly.</p>
<p>Socrates then did not fare badly?&mdash;No; but his judges
and his accusers did.&mdash;Nor did Helvidius<note anchored="yes">See i. 2, note 5.</note> at Rome fare
badly?&mdash;No; but his murderer did. How do you mean?&mdash;
The same as you do when you say that a cock has not
fared badly when he has gained the victory and been
severely wounded; but that the cock has fared badly when
he has been defeated and is unhurt: nor do you call a dog
fortunate, who neither pursues game nor labours, but
when you see him sweating,<note anchored="yes">I do not know if dogs sweat; at least in a state of health I have
never seen it. But this is a question for the learned in dog science.</note> when you see him in pain
and panting violently after running. What paradox (unusual thing) do we utter if we say that the evil in every
thing is that which is contrary to the nature of the thing?
Is this a paradox? for do you not say this in the case of
all other things? Why then in the case of man only do
you think differently? But because we say that the nature
of man is tame (gentle) and social and faithful, you will
not say that this is a paradox?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> It is not&mdash;What then
is it a paradox to say that a man is not hurt when he is
whipped, or put in chains, or beheaded? does he not, if he
suffers nobly, come off even with increased advantage and
profit? But is he not hurt, who suffers in a most pitiful
and disgraceful way, who in place of a man becomes a
wolf, or viper or wasp?</p>
<p>Well then let us recapitulate the things which have
been agreed on. The man who is not under restraint is
free, to whom things are exactly in that state in which he
wishes them to be; but he who can be restrained or compelled or hindered, or thrown into any circumstances
<pb n="314"/>
against his will, is a slave. But who is free from restraint?
He who desires nothing that belongs to (is in the power
of) others. And what are the things which belong to
others? Those which are not in our power either to have
or not to have, or to have of a certain kind or in a certain
manner.<note anchored="yes">As Upton remarks, Epictetus is referring to the four categories of
the Stoics.</note> Therefore the body belongs to another, the
parts of the body belong to another, possession (property)
belongs to another. If then you are attached to any of
these things as your own, you will pay the penalty which
it is proper for him to pay who desires what belongs to
another. This road leads to freedom, this is the only way
of escaping from slavery, to be able to say at last with all
your soul

But what do you say, philosopher? The tyrant summons
you to say something which does not become you. Do you
say it or do you not? Answer me&mdash;Let me consider&mdash;Will
you consider now? But when you were in the school, what
was it which you used to consider? Did you not study
what are the things that are good and what are bad, and
what things are neither one nor the other?&mdash;I did.&mdash;What
then was our opinion?&mdash;That just and honourable acts
were good; and that unjust and disgraceful (foul) acts
were bad.&mdash;Is life a good thing?&mdash;No.&mdash;Is death a bad
thing?&mdash;No.&mdash;Is prison?&mdash;No.&mdash;But what did we think
about mean and faithless words and betrayal of a friend
and flattery of a tyrant?&mdash;That they are bad.&mdash;Well then,
you are not considering, nor have you considered nor deliberated. For what is the matter for consideration, is it
whether it is becoming for me, when I have it in my
power, to secure for myself the greatest of good things,
and not to secure for myself (that is, not to avoid) the
greatest evils? A fine inquiry indeed, and necessary, and
one that demands much deliberation. Man, why do you
mock us? Such an inquiry is never made. If you really
<pb n="315"/>
imagined that base things were bad and honourable things
were good, and that all other things were neither good nor
bad, you would not even have approached this enquiry,
nor have come near it; but immediately you would have
been able to distinguish them by the understanding as you
would do (in other cases) by the vision. For when do
you inquire if black things are white, if heavy things are
light, and do not comprehend the manifest evidence of the
senses? How then do you now say that you are considering whether things which are neither good nor bad ought
to be avoided more than things which are bad? But you
do not possess these opinions; and neither do these things
seem to you to be neither good nor bad, but you think
that they are the greatest evils; nor do you think those
other things (mean and faithless words, etc.) to be evils, but
matters which do not concern us at all. For thus from the
beginning you have accustomed yourself. Where am I?
In the schools: and are any listening to me? I am discoursing among philosophers. But I have gone out of the
school. Away with this talk of scholars and fools. Thus
a friend is overpowered by the testimony of a philosopher:<note anchored="yes"><lg>
<l>Stoicus occidit Baream, delator amicum,</l>
<l>Discipulumque senex.</l></lg>
<p>Juvenal, iii. 116.
Epictetus is supposed to allude to the crime of Egnatius Celer who
accused Barea Soranus at Rome in the reign of Nero (<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16.32">Tacit. Ann. xvi. 32</bibl>).</p></note>
thus a philosopher becomes a parasite; thus he lets himself for hire for money: thus in the senate a man does not
say what he thinks; in private (in the school) he proclaims
his opinions.<note anchored="yes">Mrs. Carter says that 'there is much obscurity and some variety of
reading in several lines of the original.' But see Schweig.'s notes.
Epictetus is showing that talk about philosophy is useless: philosophy
should be practical.</note> You are a cold and miserable little opinion,
suspended from idle words as from a hair. But keep yourself strong and fit for the uses of life and initiated by being
exercised in action. How do you hear (the report)?&mdash;I do
not say, that your child is dead&mdash;for how could you bear
that?&mdash;but that your oil is spilled, your wine drunk up.
Do you act in such a way that one standing by you while
you are making a great noise, may say this only, Philo-
<pb n="316"/>
sopher, you say something different in the school. Why
do you deceive us? Why, when you are only a worm, do
you say that you are a man? I should like to be present
when some of the philosophers is lying with a woman, that
I might see how he is exerting himself, and what words he
is uttering, and whether he remembers his title of philosopher, and the words which he hears or says or reads.</p>
<p>And what is this to liberty? Nothing else than this,
whether you who are rich choose or not.&mdash;And who is
your evidence for this?&mdash;who else than yourselves? who
have a powerful master (Caesar), and who live in obedience to his nod and motion, and who faint if he only looks
at you with a scowling countenance; you who court old
women<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hor. S. 2.5">Horace Sat. ii. 5</bibl>.</note> and old men, and say, I cannot do this: it is not
in my power. Why is it not in your power? Did you
not lately contend with me and say that you are free?
But Aprulla<note anchored="yes">Aprulla is a Roman woman's name. It means some old woman
who is courted for her money.</note> has hindered me? Tell the truth then,
slave, and do not run away from your masters, nor deny,
nor venture to produce any one to assert your freedom
(<foreign lang="greek">karpioth/n</foreign>), when you have so many evidences of your
slavery. And indeed when a man is compelled by love to
do something contrary to his opinion (judgment), and at
the same time sees the better, but has not the strength to
follow it, one might consider him still more worthy of
excuse as being held by a certain violent and in a manner
a divine power.<note anchored="yes">Compare Plato (Symposium, p. 206): 'All men conceive both as to
the body and as to the soul, and when they have arrived at a certain age,
our nature desires to procreate. But it cannot procreate in that which
is ugly, but in that which is beautiful. For the conjunction of man and
woman is generation; but this act is divine, and this in the animal
which is mortal is divine, conceiving and begetting.' See what is said
in ii. 23, note 10 on marrying. In a certain sense the procreation of
children is a duty, and consequently the providing for them is also a
duty. It is the fulfilling of the will and purpose of the Deity to people
the earth; and therefore the act of procreation is divine. So a man's
duty is to labour in some way, and if necessary, to earn his living and
sustain the life which he has received; and this is also a divine act.
Paul's opinion of marriage is contained in Cor. i. 7. Some of his teaching on this matter has been justly condemned. He has no conception of
the true nature of marriage; at least he does not show that he has in this chapter. His teaching is impracticable, contrary to that of Epictetus,
and to the nature and constitution of man; and it is rejected by the
good sense of Christians who affect to receive his teaching; except, I
suppose, by the superstitious body of Christians, who recommend and
commend the so-called religious, and unmarried life.</note> But who could endure you who are in
<pb n="317"/>
love with old women and old men, and wipe the old
women's noses, and wash them and give them presents,
and also wait on them like a slave when they are sick,
and at the same time wish them dead, and question the
physicians whether they are sick unto death? And again,
when in order to obtain these great and much admired
magistracies and honours, you kiss the hands of these
slaves of others, and so you are not the slave even of free
men. Then you walk about before me in stately fashion
a praetor or a consul. Do I not know how you became a
praetor, by what means you got your consulship, who
gave it to you? I would not even choose to live, if I
must live by help of Felicion<note anchored="yes">Felicion. See i. 19, p. 62.</note> and endure his arrogance
and servile insolence: for I know what a slave is, who is
fortunate, as he thinks, and puffed up by pride.</p>
<p>You then, a man may say, are you free? I wish, by the
Gods, and pray to be free; but I am not yet able to face
my masters, I still value my poor body, I value greatly
the preservation of it entire, though I do not possess it
entire.<note anchored="yes">Epictetus alludes to his lameness: compare i. 8. 14, i. 16. 20, and
other passages. Upton.</note> But I can point out to you a free man, that you
may no longer seek an example. Diogenes was free.
How was he free?&mdash;not because he was born of free
parents,<note anchored="yes">Schweig. doubts if the words <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r h(n</foreign>, which I have omitted, are
genuine, and give his reasons for the doubt.</note> but because he was himself free, because he
had cast off all the handles of slavery, and it was not
possible for any man to approach him, nor had any man
the means of laying hold of him to enslave him. He had
everything easily loosed, everything only hanging to him.
If you laid hold of his property, he would have rather
let it go and be yours, than he would have followed you
for it: if you had laid hold of his leg, he would have let
go his leg; if of all his body, all his poor body; his
intimates, friends, country, just the same. For he knew
<pb n="318"/>
from whence he had them, and from whom, and on what
conditions. His true parents indeed, the Gods, and his
real country he would never have deserted, nor would he
have yielded to any man in obedience to them and to their
orders, nor would any man have died for his country more
readily. For he was not used to inquire when he should
be considered to have done anything on behalf of the whole
of things (the universe, or all the world), but he remembered that every thing which is done comes from thence
and is done on behalf of that country and is commanded
by him who administers it.<note anchored="yes">Schweig. has a note on this difficult passage, which is rather
obscure.</note> Therefore see what Diogenes himself says and writes:&mdash;<quote>For this reason, he
says, Diogenes, it is in your power to speak both with
the King of the Persians and with Archidamus the king
of the Lacedaemonians, as you please.</quote> Was it because
he was born of free parents? I suppose all the Athenians
and all the Lacedaemonians because they were born
of slaves, could not talk with them (these kings) as
they wished, but feared and paid court to them. Why
then does he say that it is in his power? Because I do
not consider the poor body to be my own, because I want
nothing, because law<note anchored="yes">The sense of' law' (<foreign lang="greek">o( no/mos</foreign>) can be collected from what follows.
Compare the discourse of Socrates on obedience to the law. (Criton,
c. 11, &amp; c.)</note> is every thing to me, and nothing
else is. These were the things which permitted him to be
free.</p>
<p>And that you may not think that I show you the example of a man who is a solitary person,<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note on <foreign lang="greek">a)perista/tou</foreign>.</note> who has neither
wife nor children, nor country, nor friends nor kinsmen, by
whom he could be bent and drawn in various directions,
take Socrates and observe that he had a wife and children,
but he did not consider them as his own; that he had a
country, so long as it was fit to have one, and in such a
manner as was fit; friends and kinsmen also, but he held
all in subjection to law and to the obedience due to it.
For this reason he was the first to go out as a soldier, when
it was necessary, and in war he exposed himself to danger
<pb n="319"/>
most unsparingly;<note anchored="yes">Socrates fought at Potidaea, Amphipolis and Delium. He is said
to have gained the prize for courage at Delium. He was a brave
soldier as well as a philosopher, a union of qualities not common.
(Plato's Apology.)</note> and when he was sent by the tyrants
to seize Leon, he did not even deliberate about the matter,
because he thought that it was a base action, and he knew
that he must die (for his refusal), if it so happened.<note anchored="yes">Socrates with others was ordered by the Thirty tyrants, who at
that time governed Athens, to arrest Leon in the island of Salamis and
to bring him to be put to death. But Socrates refused to obey the
order. Few men would have done what he did under the circum-
stances. (Plato's Apology; M. Antoninus, vii. 66.)</note>
And what difference did that make to him? for he intended to preserve something else, not his poor flesh, but
his fidelity, his honourable character. These are things
which could not be assailed nor brought into subjection.
Then when he was obliged to speak in defence of his life,
did he behave like a man who had children, who had a
wife? No, but he behaved like a man who has neither.
And what did he do when he was (ordered) to drink the
poison,<note anchored="yes">Cicero, Tuscul. Disp. i. 29.</note> and when he had the power of escaping from
prison, and when Crito said to him, Escape for the sake of
your children, what did Socrates say?<note anchored="yes">The Dialogue of Plato, named Criton, contains the arguments
which were used by his friends to persuade Socrates to escape from
prison, and the reply of Socrates.</note> did he consider
the power of escape as an unexpected gain? By no
means: he considered what was fit and proper; but the
rest he did not even look at or take into the reckoning.
For he did not choose, he said, to save his poor body, but
to save that which is increased and saved by doing what
is just, and is impaired and destroyed by doing what is
unjust. Socrates will not save his life by a base act; he
who would not put the Athenians to the vote when they
clamoured that he should do so,<note anchored="yes">This alludes to the behaviour of Socrates when he refused to put
to the vote the matter of the Athenian generals and this behaviour after
the naval battle of Arginusae. The violence of the weather prevented
the commanders from collecting and honorably burying those who fell
in the battle; and the Athenians after their hasty fashion, wished all
the commanders to be put to death. But Socrates, who was in office
at this time, resisted the unjust clamour of the people. Xenophon
<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.7.15">Hellenica, i. c. 7, 15</bibl>; Plato, Apologia; Xenophon, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.1.18">Memorab. i. 1, 18</bibl></note> he who refused to obey
<pb n="320"/>
the tyrants, he who discoursed in such a manner about
virtue and right behaviour. It is not possible to save
such a man's life by base acts, but he is saved by dying,
not by running away. For the good actor also preserves
his character by stopping when he ought to stop, better
than when he goes on acting beyond the proper time.
What then shall the children of Socrates do? <quote>If,</quote> said
Socrates, <quote>I had gone off to Thessaly, would you have
taken care of them; and if I depart to the world below,
will there be no man to take care of them?</quote> See how he
gives to death a gentle name and mocks it. But if you
and I had been in his place, we should have immediately
answered as philosophers that those who act unjustly must
be repaid in the same way, and we should have added, <quote>I
shall be useful to many, if my life is saved, and if I die,
I shall be useful to no man.</quote> For, if it had been necessary, we should have made our escape by slipping through
a small hole. And how in that case should we have been
useful to any man? for where would they have been then
staying?<note anchored="yes">The original is <foreign lang="greek">pou= ga\r a)\n e)/ti e)/menon e)kei=noi</foreign>; this seems to mean,
if we had escaped and left the country, where would those have been to
whom we might have been useful? They would have been left behind,
and we could have done nothing for them.</note> or if we were useful to men while we were
alive, should we not have been much more useful to
them by dying when we ought to die, and as we ought?
And now Socrates being dead, no less useful to men, and
even more useful, is the remembrance of that which he did
or said when he was alive.<note anchored="yes">This is the conclusion about Socrates, whom Epictetus highly
valued: the remembrance of what Socrates did and said is even more
useful than his life. <quote>The life of the dead,</quote> says Cicero of Servius
Sulpicius, the great Roman jurist and Cicero's friend, <quote>rests in the
remembrance of the living.</quote> Epictetus has told us of some of the acts
of Socrates, which prove him to have been a brave and honest man.
Ho does not tell us here what Socrates said, which means what he
taught; but he knew what it was. Modern writers have expounded
the matter at length, and in a form which Epictetus would not or
could not have used.&mdash;Socrates left to others the questions which relate
to the material world, and he first taught, as we are told, the things
which concern man's daily life and his intercourse with other men: in
other words he taught Ethic (the principles of morality). Fields and
trees, he said, will teach me nothing, but man in his social state will;
and man then is the proper subject of the philosophy of Socrates. The
beginning of this knowledge was as he said, to know himself according to the precept of the Delphic oracle, Know thyself (<foreign lang="greek">gnw=qi seauto/n</foreign>):
and the object of his philosophy was to comprehend the nature of man
as a moral being in all relations; and among these the relation of man
to God as the father of all, creator and ruler of all, as Plato expresses
it. Socrates taught that what we call death is not the end of man;
death is only the road to another life. The death of Socrates was conformable to his life and teaching. <quote>Socrates died not only with the
noblest courage and tranquillity, but he also refused, as we are told, to
escape from death, which the laws of the state permitted, by going into
exile or paying a fine, because as he said, if he had himself consented
to a fine or allowed 'thers to propose it, (Xenophon, <bibl n="Xen. Apol. 22">Apol. &sect; 22</bibl>), such
an act would have been an admission of his guilt. Both (Socrates
and Jesus) offered themselves with the firmest resolution for a holy
cause, which was so far from being lost through their death that it
only served rather to make it the general cause of mankind.</quote> (Das
Christliche des Platonismus oder Socrates und Christus, by F. C. Baur.)
<p>This essay by Baur is very ingenious. Perhaps there are some
readers who will disagree with him on many points in the comparison
of Socrates and Christus. However the essay is well worth the trouble
of reading.</p>
<p>The opinion of Rousseau in his comparison of Jesus and Socrates is
in some respects more just than that of Baur, though the learning of
the Frenchman is very small when compared with that of the German.
<quote>What prejudices, what blindness must a man have,</quote> says Rousseau,
<quote>when he dares to compare the son of Sophroniscus with the son of
Mary!&mdash;The death of Socrates philosophising tranquilly with his
friends is the most gentle that a man could desire; that of Jesus expiring in torments, insulted, jeered, cursed by a whole people, is the
most horrible that: man could dread. Socrates taking the poisoned
cup blesses him who presents it and weeps; Jesus in his horrible
punishment prays for his savage executioners. Yes, if the life and the
death of Socrates are those of a sage, the life and the death of Jesus are
those of a God.</quote> (Rousseau, Emile, vol. iii. p. 166. Amsterdam, <date value="1765">1765</date>.)</p></note>

<p>Think of these things, these opinions, these words: look
to these examples, if you would be free, if you desire the
thing according to its worth. And what is the wonder
if you buy so great a thing at the price of things so many
and so great? For the sake of this which is called liberty,
some hang themselves, others throw themselves down precipices, and sometimes even whole cities have perished:
and will you not for the sake of the true and unassailable
and secure liberty give back to God when he demands
them the things which he has given? Will you not, as
Plato says, study not to die only, but also to endure torture, and exile, and scourging and in a word to give up
all which is not your own? If you will not, you will be
<pb n="322"/>
a slave among slaves, even if you be ten thousand times
a consul; and if you make your way up to the Palace
(Caesar's residence), you will no less be a slave; and you
will feel, that perhaps philosophers utter words which are
contrary to common opinion (paradoxes), as Cleanthes also
said, but not words contrary to reason. For you will know
by experience that the words are true, and that there is no
profit from the things which are valued and eagerly sought
to those who have obtained them; and to those who have
not yet obtained them there is an imagination (<foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>),
that when these things are come, all that is good will
come with them; then, when they are come, the feverish
feeling is the same, the tossing to and fro is the same,
the satiety, the desire of things which are not present;
for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of the
things which are desired, but by removing the desire.
And that you may know that this is true, as you have
laboured for those things, so transfer your labour to these;
be vigilant for the purpose of acquiring an opinion which
will make you free; pay court to a philosopher instead of
to a rich old man: be seen about a philosopher's doors:
you will not disgrace yourself by being seen; you will
not go away empty nor without profit, if you go to the
philosopher as you ought, and if not (if you do not succeed), try at least: the trial (attempt) is not disgraceful.</p></div2>

same things to be the same man that he was. Choose
then which of the two you will have, to be equally loved
by those by whom you were formerly loved, being the
same with your former self; or being superior, not to
obtain from your friends the same that you did before.
For if this is better, immediately turn away to it, and let
not other considerations draw you in a different direction.
For no man is able to make progress (improvement), when
he is wavering between opposite things; but if you have
preferred this (one thing) to all things, if you choose to
attend to this only, to work out this only, give up every
thing else. But if you will not do this, your wavering
will produce both these results: you will neither improve
as you ought, nor will you obtain what you formerly
obtained. For before by plainly desiring the things
which were worth nothing, you pleased your associates.
But you cannot excel in both kinds, and it is necessary
that so far as you share in the one, you must fall short in
the other. You cannot, when you do not drink with those
with whom you used to drink, be agreeable to them as you
were before. Choose then whether you will be a hard
drinker and pleasant to your former associates or a sober
man and disagreeable to them. You cannot, when you do
not sing with those with whom you used to sing, be
equally loved by them. Choose then in this matter also
which of the two you will have. For if it is better to be
modest and orderly than for a man to say, He is a jolly
fellow, give up the rest, renounce it, turn away from it,
have nothing to do with such men. But if this behaviour
shall not please you, turn altogether to the opposite: become a catamite, an adulterer, and act accordingly, and
you will get what you wish. And jump up in the theatre
and bawl out in praise of the dancer. But characters so
different cannot be mingled: you cannot act both Thersites
and Agamemnon. If you intend to be Thersites,<note anchored="yes">See Iliad, ii 216; and for the description of Agamemnon, Iliad
iii. 167.</note> you
must be humpbacked and bald: if Agamemnon, you must
be tall and handsome, and love those who are placed in
obedience to you.

<head>What things we should exchange for other things.</head>
<p>KEEP this thought in readiness, when you lose any thing
external, what you acquire in place of it; and if it be
worth more, never say, I have had a loss; neither<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> if you
have got a horse in place of an ass, or an ox in place of a
sheep, nor a good action in place of a bit of money, nor in
place of idle talk such tranquillity as befits a man, nor in
place of lewd talk if you have acquired modesty. If you
remember this, you will always maintain your character
such as it ought to be. But if you do not, consider that
the times of opportunity are perishing, and that whatever
pains you take about yourself, you are going to waste
them all and overturn them. And it needs only a few
things for the loss and overturning of all, namely a small
deviation from reason. For the steerer of a ship to upset it,
he has no need of the same means as he has need of for
saving it: but if he turns it a little to the wind, it is
lost; and if he does not do this purposely, but has been
neglecting his duty a little, the ship is lost. Something
of the kind happens in this case also: if you only fall
a nodding a little, all that you have up to this time
collected is gone. Attend therefore to the appearances of
things, and watch over them; for that which you have to
preserve is no small matter, but it is modesty and fidelity
and constancy, freedom from the affects, a state of mind
undisturbed, freedom from fear, tranquillity, in a word
liberty. For what will you sell these things? See what
is the value of the things which you will obtain in exchange for these.&mdash;But shall I not obtain any such thing
for it?&mdash;See, and if you do in return get that, see what
you receive in place of it.<note anchored="yes">The text is obscure, and perhaps there is something wrong,

<head>To those who are desirous of passing life in tranquillity.</head>
<p>REMEMBER that not only the desire of power and of riches
makes us mean and subject to others, but even the desire
of tranquillity, and of leisure, and of travelling abroad,
and of learning. For to speak plainly, whatever the
external thing may be, the value which we set upon it
places us in subjection to others. What then is the difference between desiring to be a senator or not desiring
to be one; what is the difference between desiring power
or being content with a private station; what is the difference between saying, I am unhappy, I have nothing to
do, but I am bound to my books as a corpse; or saying, I
am unhappy, I have no leisure for reading? For as salutations<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)spasmoi/</foreign>. See this chapter further on.</note> and power are things external and independent of

to read? Tell me. For if you only direct your purpose
to being amused or learning something, you are a silly
fellow and incapable of enduring labour.<note anchored="yes">See Bishop Butler's remarks in the Preface to his Sermons vol. ii.
He speaks of the 'idle way of reading and considering things: by this
means, time even in solitude is happily got rid of without the pain of
attention: neither is any part of it more put to the account of idleness,

part of that which is spent in reading.'</note> But if you
refer reading to the proper end, what else is this than a
tranquil and happy life (<foreign lang="greek">eu)/soia</foreign>)? But if reading does not
secure for you a happy and tranquil life, what is the use
of it? But it does secure this, the man replies, and for
this reason I am vexed that I am deprived of it.&mdash;And
what is this tranquil and happy life, which any man can
impede, I do not say Caesar or Caesar's friend, but a crow,
a piper, a fever, and thirty thousand other things? But
a tranquil and happy life contains nothing so sure as continuity and freedom from obstacle. Now I am called to

themselves to a necessity of dwelling on this consequence, extravagant
as it is, by rejecting stronger aids. One cannot indeed avoid highly
admiring the very few. who attempted to amend and exalt themselves
on this foundation. No one perhaps ever carried the attempt so far in
practice, and no one ever spoke so well in support of the argument as
Epictetus. Yet, notwithstanding his great abilities and the force of
his example, one finds him strongly complaining of the want of success;
and one sees from this circumstance as well as from others in the Stoic
writings, That virtue can not be maintained in the world without the
hope of a future reward.' Mrs. Carter.</note> and then that I may attend

not with any bad disposition, or that I may have something to blame or to ridicule; but I turn to myself, and
ask if I also commit the same faults. How then shall I
<pb n="327"/>
cease to commit them? Formerly I also acted wrong,
but now I do not: thanks to God.</p>
<p>Come, when you have done these things and have attended to them, have you done a worse act than when you
have read a thousand verses or written as many? For when
you eat, are you grieved because you are not reading? are
you not satisfied with eating according to what you have
learned by reading, and so with bathing and with exercise? Why then do you not act consistently in all things,
both when you approach Caesar, and when you approach
any person? If you maintain yourself free from perturbation, free from alarm, and steady; if you look rather at
the things which are done and happen than are looked at
yourself; if you do not envy those who are I referred before
you; if surrounding circumstances (<foreign lang="greek">u(/lai</foreign>) do not strike you
with fear or admiration, what do you want? Books? How
or for what purpose? for is not this (the reading of
books) a preparation for life? and is not life itself
(living) made up of certain other things than this? This
is just as if an athlete should weep when he enters the
stadium, because he is not being exercised outside of it.
It was for this purpose that you used to practise exercise;
for this purpose were used the halteres (weights),<note anchored="yes">See i. 4. note 5, iii. 15. 4; and i. 24. 1, i. 29. 34. The athletes were
oiled, but they used to rub themselves with dust to be enabled to lay
hold of one another.</note> the dust,
the young men as antagonists; and do you seek for those
things now when it is the time of action? This is just as
if in the topic (matter) of assent when appearances present themselves, some of which can be comprehended, and
some cannot be comprehended, we should not choose to
distinguish them but should choose to read what has been
written about comprehension (<foreign lang="greek">kata/lhyis</foreign>).</p>
<p>What then is the reason of this? The reason is that
we have never read for this purpose, we have never written
for this purpose, so that we may in our actions use in away
conformable to nature the appearances presented to us;
but we terminate in this, in learning what is said, and in
being able to expound it to another, in resolving a syllogism,<note anchored="yes">M. Antoninus, i. 17, thanks the Gods that he did not waste his
time in the resolution of syllogisms.</note> and in handling the hypothetical syllogism. For
<pb n="328"/>
this reason where our study (purpose) is, there alone is
the impediment. Would you have by all means the
things which are not in your power? Be prevented
then, be hindered, fail in your purpose. But if we read
what is written about action (efforts, <foreign lang="greek">o(rmh/</foreign>),<note anchored="yes">See iii. c. 2.</note> not that we
may see what is said about action, but that we may act
well: if we read what is said about desire and aversion
(avoiding things), in order that we may neither fail in
our desires, nor fall into that which we try to avoid; if
we read what is said about duty (officium), in order that
remembering the relations (of things to one another) we
may do nothing irrationally nor contrary to these relations; we should not be vexed in being hindered as to our
readings, but we should be satisfied with doing the acts
which are conformable (to the relations), and we should
be reckoning not what so far we have been accustomed to
reckon: To-day I have read so many verses, I have written
so many; but (we should say), To-day I have employed
my action as it is taught by the philosophers; I have not
employed my desire; I have used avoidance (<foreign lang="greek">e)kkli/sei</foreign>) only
with respect to things which are within the power of my
will; I have not been afraid of such a person, I have not
been prevailed upon by the entreaties of another; I have
exercised my patience,<note anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Gel. 17.19">Aulus Gellius xvii. 19</bibl>, where he quotes Epictetus on what
Gellius expresses by <foreign lang="la">'intolerantia'</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">'incontinentia.'</foreign> Compare M.
Antoninus (v. 33) on the precept <foreign lang="greek">*)ane/xou</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">*)ape/xou</foreign>.</note> my abstinence, my co-operation
with others; and so we should thank God for what we
ought to thank him.</p>
<p>But now we do not know that we also in another way
are like the many. Another man is afraid that he shall
not have power: you are afraid that you will. Do not do
so, my man; but as you ridicule him who is afraid that he
shall not have power, so ridicule yourself also. For it
makes no difference whether you are thirsty like a man
who has a fever, or have a dread of water like a man who
is mad. Or how will you still be able to say as Socrates
did, If so it pleases God, so let it be? Do you think that
Socrates if he had been eager to pass his leisure in the
Lyceum or in the Academy and to discourse daily with
the young men, would have readily served in military
<pb n="329"/>
expeditions so often as he did; and would he not have
lamented and groaned, Wretch that I am; I must now
be miserable here, when I might be sunning myself in the
Lyceum? Why, was this your business, to sun yourself?
And is it not your business to be happy, to be free from
hindrance, free from impediment? And could he still have
been Socrates, if he had lamented in this way: how would
he still have been able to write Paeans in his prison?<note anchored="yes">Plato in the Phaedon (c. 4) says that Socrates in his prison wrote
a hymn to Apollo.</note></p>
<p>In short remember this, that what you shall prize which
is beyond your will, so far you have destroyed your will.
But these things are out of the power of the will, not
only power (authority), but also a private condition: not
only occupation (business), but also leisure.&mdash;Now then
must I live in this tumult?&mdash;Why do you say tumult?&mdash;I
mean among many men.&mdash;Well what is the hardship?
Suppose that you are at Olympia: imagine it to be a
panegyris (public assembly), where one is calling out one
thing, another is doing another thing, and a third is pushing another person: in the baths there is a crowd: and
who of us is not pleased with this assembly, and leaves it
unwillingly? Be not difficult to please nor fastidious
about what happens.&mdash;Vinegar is disagreeable, for it is
sharp; honey is disagreeable, for it disturbs my habit of
body. I do not like vegetables. So also I do not like leisure
it is a desert: I do not like a crowd; it is confusion.&mdash;
But if circumstances make it necessary for you to live
alone or with a few, call it quiet, and use the thing as you
ought: talk with yourself, exercise the appearances (presented to you), work up your preconceptions.<note anchored="yes">i 22.</note> If you
fall into a crowd, call it a celebration of games, a panegyris,
a festival: try to enjoy the festival with other men. For
what is a more pleasant sight to him who loves mankind
than a number of men? We see with pleasure herds of
horses or oxen: we are delighted when we see many ships:
who is pained when he sees many men?&mdash;But they deafen
me with their cries.&mdash;Then your hearing is impeded.
What then is this to you? Is then the power of making
use of appearances hindered? And who prevents you
<pb n="330"/>
from using according to nature inclination to a thing and
aversion from it; and movement towards a thing and movement from it? What tumult (confusion) is able to do
this?</p>
<p>Do you only bear in mind the general rules: what is
mine, what is not mine; what is given (permitted) to me;
what does God will that I should do now? what does he
not will? A little before he willed you to be at leisure,
to talk with yourself, to write about these things, to read,
to hear, to prepare yourself. You had sufficient time for
this. Now he says to you: Come now to the contest,
show us what you have learned, how you have practised
the athletic art. How long will you be exercised alone?
Now is the opportunity for you to learn whether you are
an athlete worthy of victory, or one of those who go about
the world and are defeated. Why then are you vexed?
No contest is without confusion. There must be many
who exercise themselves for the contest, many who call
out to those who exercise themselves, many masters, many
spectators.&mdash;But my wish is to live quietly.&mdash;Lament then
and groan as you deserve to do. For what other is a
greater punishment than this to the untaught man and to
him who disobeys the divine commands, to be grieved, to
lament, to envy, in a word to be disappointed and to be
unhappy? Would you not release yourself from these
things?&mdash;And how shall I release myself?&mdash;Have you not
often heard, that you ought to remove entirely desire,
apply aversion (turning away) to those things only which
are within your power, that you ought to give up every
thing, body, property, fame, books, tumult, power, private
station? for whatever way you turn, you are a slave, you
are subjected, you are hindered, you are compelled, you
are entirely in the power of others. But keep the words
of Cleanthes in readiness.
<quote rend="blockquote">Lead me, O Zeus, and thou necessity.</quote><note anchored="yes">Compare Encheiridion, 52. Cleanthes was a Stoic philosopher,
who also wrote some poetry. See p. 292, note.</note></p>
<p>Is it your will that I should go to Rome? I will go to
Rome. To Gyara? I will go to Gyara. To Athens? I
<pb n="331"/>
will go to Athens. To prison? I will go to prison. If
you should once say, When shall a man go to Athens?
you are undone. It is a necessary consequence that this
desire, if it is not accomplished, must make you unhappy;
and if it is accomplished, it must make you vain, since
you are elated at things at which you ought not to be
elated; and on the other hand, if you are impeded, it
must make you wretched because you fall into that which
you would not fall into. Give up then all these things.&mdash;
Athens is a good place.&mdash;But happiness is much better;
and to be free from passions, free from disturbance, for
your affairs not to depend on any man. There is tumult
at Rome and visits of salutation.<note anchored="yes">He alludes to the practice of dependents paying formal visits in
the morning at the houses of the great and powerful at Rome. Upton
refers to Virgil, Georgics, ii. 461.</note> But happiness is an
equivalent for all troublesome things. If then the time
comes for these things, why do you not take away the wish
to avoid them? what necessity is there to carry a burden
like an ass, and to be beaten with a stick? But if you do
not so, consider that you must always be a slave to him
who has it in his power to effect your release, and also to
impede you, and you must serve him as an evil genius.<note anchored="yes">Compare i. 19. 6.</note></p>
<p>There is only one way to happiness, and let this rule be
ready both in the morning and during the day and by
night: the rule is not to look towards things which are
out of the power of our will, to think that nothing is our
own, to give up all things to the Divinity, to Fortune; to
make them the superintendents of these things, whom
Zeus also has made so; for a man to observe that only
which is his own, that which cannot be hindered; and
when we read, to refer our reading to this only, and our
writing and our listening. For this reason I cannot call
the man industrious, if I hear this only, that he reads and
writes; and even if a man adds that he reads all night, I
cannot say so, if he knows not to what he should refer his
reading. For neither do you say that a man is industrious
if he keeps awake for a girl;<note anchored="yes">Compare <bibl n="Hor. S. 1.5.83">Horace Sat. i. 5. 83</bibl>.</note> nor do I. But if he does
it (reads and writes) for reputation, I say that he is a
<pb n="332"/>
lover of reputation. And if he does it for money, I say
that he is a lover of money, not a lover of labour; and if
he does it through love of learning, I say that he is a lover
of learning, But if he refers his labour to his own ruling
power (<foreign lang="greek">h(gemoniko/n</foreign>), that he may keep it in a state con-
formable to nature and pass his life in that state, then only
do I say that he is industrious. For never commend a
man on account of these things which are common to all,
but on account of his opinions (principles); fur these are
the things which belong to each man, which make his
actions bad or good. Remembering these rules, rejoice in
that which is present, and be content with the things
which come in season.<note anchored="yes">See Antoninus, vi. 2; and ix. 6 'Thy present opinion founded on
understanding, and thy present conduct directed to social good, and
thy present disposition of contentment with everything which happens
&mdash;that is enough.'</note> If you see any thing which you
have learned and inquired about occurring to you in your
course of life (or opportunely applied by you to the acts of
life), be delighted at it. If you have laid aside or have
lessened bad disposition and a habit of reviling; if you
have done so with rash temper, obscene words, hastiness,
sluggishness; if you are not moved by what you formerly
were, and not in the same way as you once were, you can
celebrate a festival daily, to-day because you have behaved
well in one act, and to-morrow because you have behaved
well in another. How much greater is this a reason for
making sacrifices than a consulship or the government of
a province? These things come to you from yourself and
from the gods. Remember this, who gives these things
and to whom, and for what purpose. If you cherish yourself in these thoughts, do you still think that it makes any
difference where you shall be happy, where you shall
please God? Are not the gods equally distant from all
places?<note anchored="yes">Compare Upton's note on <foreign lang="greek">a)pe/xousi</foreign>, and Schweig.'s version, and

<head>Against the quarrelsome and ferocious.</head>
<p>THE wise and good man neither himself fights with any
person, nor does he allow another, so far as he can prevent it. And an example of this as well as of all other
things is proposed to us in the life of Socrates, who not
only himself on all occasions avoided fights (quarrels), but
would not allow even others to quarrel. See in Xenophon's
Symposium<note anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Xen. Sym. 2.12.15">ii, 12. 15</bibl>.</note> how many quarrels he settled, how further
he endured Thrasymachus and Polus and Callicles; how
he tolerated his wife, and how he tolerated his son<note anchored="yes">See Xenophon, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2.2">Memorabilia, ii. 2</bibl>,</note> who
attempted to confute him and to cavil with him. For he
remembered well that no man has in his power another
man's ruling principle. He wished therefore for nothing
else than that which was his own. And what is this?
Not that this or that man may act according to nature;
for that is a thing which belongs to another; but that
while others are doing their own acts, as they choose, he
may never the less be in a condition conformable to
nature and live in it, only doing what is his own to the
end that others also may be in a state conformable to
nature. For this is the object always set before him by
the wise and good man. Is it to be commander (a
praetor)<note anchored="yes">The word <foreign lang="greek">strathgh=sai</foreign> may be translated either way.</note> of an army? No: but if it is permitted him,
his object is in this matter to maintain his own ruling
principle. Is it to marry? No; but if marriage is allowed
to him, in this matter his object is to maintain himself in
a condition conformable to nature. But if he would have
his son not to do wrong or his wife, he would have what
belongs to another not to belong to another: and to be
instructed is this, to learn what things are a man's own
and what belongs to another.
How then is there left any place for fighting (quarrel-
ling) to a man who has this opinion (which he ought to
have)? Is he surprised at any thing which happens,
<pb n="334"/>
and does it appear new to him?<note anchored="yes">See iv. 1. 77, and the use of <foreign lang="greek">qauma/zein</foreign>.</note> Does he not expect
that which comes from the bad to be worse and more
grievous than what actually befals him? And does he not
reckon as pure gain whatever they (the bad) may do
which falls short of extreme wickedness? Such a person
has reviled you. Great thanks to him for not having
struck you. But he has struck me also. Great thanks
that he did not wound you. But he wounded me also.

men love one another, that an act of injustice is a great
harm to him who does it. Since then he has not learned
this and is not convinced of it, why shall he not follow
that which seems to be for his own interest? Your
neighbour has thrown stones. Have you then done any
thing wrong? But the things in the house have been
broken. Are you then a utensil? No; but a free power
of will.<note anchored="yes">See iii. 1. 40.</note> What then is given to you (to do) in answer to
this? If you are like a wolf, you must bite in return, and
throw more stones. But if you consider what is proper
for a man, examine your storehouse, see with what faculties you came into the world. Have you the disposition
of a wild beast, have you the disposition of revenge for an
injury? When is a horse wretched? When he is deprived
of his natural faculties, not when he cannot crow like a
cock, but when he cannot run. When is a dog wretched?
Not when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track his
game. Is then a man also unhappy in this way, not
because he cannot strangle lions or embrace statues,<note anchored="yes">Like Hercules and Diogenes See iii. 12. 2.</note> for
he did not come into the world in the possession of certain

for there are extant many coins of Nero which both in form and in the
purity of the metal are complete. A learned numismatist, Francis
Wise, fellow of Trinity College Oxford, in a letter to Upton, says that
he can discover no reason for Nero's coins being rejected in commercial
dealings after his death except the fact of the tyrant having been
declared by the Senate to be an enemy to the Commonwealth.
(Suetonius, <bibl n="Suet. Nero 49">Nero, c. 49</bibl>.) When Domitian was murdered, the Senate
ordered his busts to be taken down, as the French now do after a
revolution, and all memorials of him to be destroyed (Suetonius,
<bibl n="Suet. Dom. 23">Domitian, c. 23</bibl>). Dion also reports (LX.) that when Caligula was murdered, it was ordered that all the brass coin which bore his image
should be melted, and, I suppose, coined again. There is more on this
subject in Wise's letter.
<p>I do not believe that genuine coins would be refused in commercial
dealings for the reasons which Wise gives, at least not refused in parts
distant from Rome. Perhaps Epictetus means that some people would
not touch the coins of the detestable Nero.</p></note> So also in this case: What is
<pb n="336"/>
the stamp of his opinions? It is gentleness, a sociable disposition, a tolerant temper,
a disposition to mutual affection. Produce these qualities. I accept them: I consider
this man a citizen, I accept him as a neighbour, a com-
panion in my voyages. Only see that he has not Nero's
stamp. Is he passionate, is he full of resentment, is he
fault-finding? If the whim seizes him, does he break the
heads of those who come in his way? (If so), why then
did you say that he is a man? Is every thing judged
(determined) by the bare form? If that is so, say that the
form in wax<note anchored="yes">He says <foreign lang="greek">to\ kh/rinon</foreign>, which Mrs. Carter translates 'a piece of wax.'
Perhaps it means 'a piece of wax in the form of an apple.'</note> is an apple and has the smell and the taste
of an apple. But the external figure is not enough:
neither then is the nose enough and the eyes to make the
man, but he must have the opinions of a man. Here is
a man who does not listen to reason, who does not know
when he is refuted: he is an ass: in another man the
sense of shame is become dead: he is good for nothing, he
is any thing rather than a man. This man seeks whom
he may meet and kick or bite, so that he is not even a
sheep or an ass, but a kind of wild beast.</p>
<p>What then? would you have me to be despised?&mdash;By
whom? by those who know you? and how shall those
who know you despise a man who is gentle and modest?
Perhaps you mean by those who do not know you? What
is that to you? For no other artisan cares for the opinion
of those who know not his art.&mdash;But they will be more
hostile to me<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">e)pifu/hsontai</foreign>, the form of which is not Greek.
Schweig. has no remark on it, and he translates the word by
'adorientur.' The form ought to be <foreign lang="greek">e)pifu/sontai</foreign>. See Stephens'
Lexicon on the word <foreign lang="greek">e)pifu/omai</foreign>. Probably the word is corrupted.</note> for this reason.&mdash;Why do you say 'me'?
Can any man injure your will, or prevent you from using
in a natural way the appearances which are presented to
<pb n="337"/>
you? In no way can he. Why then are you still dis-
turbed and why do you choose to show yourself afraid?<note anchored="yes">Mrs. Carter renders <foreign lang="greek">fobero/n</foreign> by 'formidable,' and in the Latin
translation it is rendered 'formidabilem,' but that cannot be the
meaning of the word here.</note>
And why do you not come forth and proclaim that you
are at peace with all men whatever they may do, and
laugh at those chiefly who think that they can harm you?
These slaves, you can say, know not either who I am, nor
where lies my good or my evil, because they have no
access to the things which are mine.</p>
<p>In this way also those who occupy a strong city mock the
besiegers, (and say): What trouble these men are now taking
for nothing: our wall is secure, we have food for a very
long time, and all other resources. These are the things
which make a city strong and impregnable: but nothing
else than his opinions makes a man's soul impregnable.
For what wall is so strong, or what body is so hard, or
what possession is so safe, or what honour (rank, character)
so free from assault (as a man's opinions)? All (other)
things every where are perishable, easily taken by assault,
and if any man in any way is attached to them, he must
be disturbed, expect what is bad, he must fear, lament,
find his desires disappointed, and fall into things which
he would avoid. Then do we not choose to make secure
the only means of safety which are offered to us, and do
we not choose to withdraw ourselves from that which is
perishable and servile and to labour at the things which
are imperishable and by nature free; and do we not remember that no man either hurts another or does good to
another, but that a man's opinion about each thing, is that
which hurts him, is that which overturns him; this is
fighting, this is civil discord, this is war? That which
made Eteocles and Polynices<note anchored="yes">Eteocles and Polynices were the sons of the unfortunate Oedipus,

sider him who deprives us of the one and involves us in
the other an enemy and treacherous, even if he be a

to us than the good: therefore if these things (externals)
are good and evil, neither is a father a friend to sons, nor
a brother to a brother, but all the world is every where
full of enemies, treacherous men, and sycophants. But if
the will (<foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, the purpose, the intention) being what
it ought to be, is the only good; and if the will being
such as it ought not to be, is the only evil, where is there
any strife, where is there reviling? about what? about the
things which do not concern us? and strife with whom?
with the ignorant, the unhappy, with those who are deceived about the chief things?</p>
<p>Remembering this Socrates managed his own house and
endured a very ill tempered wife and a foolish (ungrateful?) son.<note anchored="yes">Socrates' wife Xanthippe is charged by her eldest son Lamprocles
with being so ill-tempered as to be past all endurance (Xenophon,
<bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2.2.7">Memorab. ii. 2, 7</bibl>). Xenophon in this chapter has reported the conversation of Socrates with his son on this matter.
<p>Diogenes Laertius (ii.) tells the story of Xanthippe pouring water
on the head of Socrates, and dirty water, as Seneca says (De Constantia,
c. 18). Aelian (xi. 12) reports that Alcibiades sent Socrates a large
and good cake, which Xanthippe trampled under her feet. Socrates
only laughed and said, Well then, you will not have your share of it.
The philosopher showed that his philosophy was practical by enduring
the torment of a very ill-tempered wife, one of the greatest calamities
that can happen to a man, and the trouble of an undutiful son.</p></note> For in what did she show her bad
temper? In pouring water on his head as much as she
liked, and in trampling on the cake (sent to Socrates).
And what is this to me, if I think that these things are
nothing to me? But this is my business; and neither
tyrant shall check my will nor a master; nor shall the
many check me who am only one, nor shall the stronger
check me who am the weaker; for this power of being
free from check (hindrance) is given by God to every
man. For these opinions make love in a house (family),

God; they make a man in all things cheerful (confident)

about things which are of no value.<note anchored="yes">This is one of the wisest and noblest expressions of Epictetus.</note> We indeed are

<head>Against those who lament over being pitied.</head>
<p>I am grieved, a man says, at being pitied. Whether then
is the fact of your being pitied a thing which concerns
you or those who pity you? Well, is it in your power to
stop this pity?&mdash;It is in my power, if I show them that
I do not require pity.&mdash;And whether then are you in the
condition of not deserving (requiring) pity, or are you not
in that condition?&mdash;I think that I am not: but these
persons do not pity me, for the things for which, if they
ought to pity me, it would be proper, I mean, for my
faults; but they pity me for my poverty, for not pos-
sessing honourable offices, for diseases and deaths and
other such things&mdash;Whether then are you prepared to convince the many, that not one of these things is an evil, but
that it is possible for a man who is poor and has no office
(<foreign lang="greek">a)na/rxonti</foreign>) and enjoys no honour to be happy; or to shew
yourself to them as rich and in power? For the second of
these things belong to a man who is boastful, silly and
good for nothing. And consider by what means the pre-
<pb n="340"/>
tence must be supported. It will be necessary for you to
hire slaves an I to possess a few silver vessels, and to exhibit them in public, if it is possible, though they are
often the same, and to attempt to conceal the fact that
they are the same, and to have splendid garments, and all
other things for display, and to show that you are a man
honoured by the great, and to try to sup at their houses,
or to be supposed to sup there, and as to your person
to employ some mean arts, that you may appear to be
more handsome and nobler than you are. These things
you must contrive, if you choose to go by the second path
in order not to be pitied. But the first way is both impracticable and long, to attempt the very thing which Zeus
has not been able to do, to convince all men what things
are good and bad.<note anchored="yes">Here it is implied that there are things which God cannot do.
Perhaps he means that as God has given man certain powers of will
and therefore of action, he cannot at the same time exercise the contradictory powers of forcing man's will and action; for this would be at the
same time to give power and to take it away. Butler remarks (Analogy,
chap. 5) <quote>the present is so far from proving in event a discipline of
virtue to the generality of men that on the contrary they seem to make
it a discipline of vice.</quote> In fact all men are not convinced and cannot
be convinced in the present constitution of things 'what things are good
and bad.'</note> Is this power given to you? This
only is given to you, to convince yourself; and you have
not convinced yourself. Then I ask you, do you attempt
to persuade other men? and who has lived so long with
you as you with yourself? and who has so much power of
convincing you as you have of convincing yourself; and
who is better disposed and nearer to you than you are to
yourself? How then have you not yet convinced yourself
in order to learn? At present are not things upside down?
Is this what you have been earnest about doing,<note anchored="yes">Something is perhaps wrong in the text here. See Schweig.'s note.</note> to learn
to be free from grief and free from disturbance, and not to
be humbled (abject), and to be free? Have you not heard
then that there is only one way which leads to this end,
to give up (dismiss) the things which do not depend on
the will, to withdraw from them, and to admit that they
belong to others? For another man then to have an opinion
about you, of what kind is it?&mdash;It is a thing independent
<pb n="341"/>
of the will&mdash;Then is it nothing to you?&mdash;-It is nothing-
When then you are still vexed at this and disturbed, do
you think that you are convinced about good and evil?</p>
<p>Will you not then letting others alone be to yourself
both scholar and teacher?&mdash;The rest of mankind will look
after this, whether it is to their interest to be and to pass
their lives in a state contrary to nature: but to me no man
is nearer than myself. What then is the meaning of this,
that I have listened to the words of the philosophers and I
assent to them, but in fact I am no way made easier (more
content)? Am I so stupid? And yet in all other things
such as I have chosen, I have not been found very stupid;
but I learned letters quickly, and to wrestle, and geometry,
and to resolve syllogisms. Has not then reason convinced
me? and indeed no other things have I from the beginning
so approved and chosen (as the things which are rational):
and now I read about these things, hear about them, write
about them; I have so far discovered no reason stronger
than this (living according to nature). In what then am
I deficient? Have the contrary opinions not been eradicated from me? Have the notions (opinions) themselves
not been exercised nor used to be applied to action, but as
armour are laid aside and rusted and cannot fit me? And
yet neither in the exercises of the palaestra, nor in writing
or reading am I satisfied with learning, but I turn up and
down the syllogisms which are proposed, and I make
others, and sophistical syllogisms also.<note anchored="yes">In place of <foreign lang="greek">mepapi/ptontas</foreign> Schweig. suggests that Arrian wrote
<foreign lang="greek">kai\ ta)/lla w(sau/tws</foreign> or something of the kind. On <foreign lang="greek">metapi/ptontas</foreign> see
Epictetus, i. 7.</note> But the necessary
theorems by proceeding from which a man can become
free from grief, fear, passions (affects), hindrance, and a
free man, these I do not exercise myself in nor do I practise in these the proper practice (study). Then I care
about what others will say of me, whether I shall appear
to them worth notice, whether I shall appear happy.&mdash;</p>
<p>Wretched man, will you not see what you are saying
about yourself? What do you appear to yourself to be? in
your opinions, in your desires, in your aversions from
things (<foreign lang="greek">e)n tw=| e)kkli/nein</foreign>), in your movements (purposes,
<foreign lang="greek">e)n o(rmh=|</foreign>) in your preparation (for anything), in your de-
<pb n="342"/>
signs (plans), and in other acts suitable to a man? But do
you trouble yourself about this, whether others pity you?
&mdash;Yes, but I am pitied not as I ought to be.&mdash;Are you then
pained at this? and is he who is pained, an object of pity?
&mdash;Yes&mdash;How then are you pitied not as you ought to be?
For by the very act that you feel (suffer) about being
pitied, you make yourself deserving of pity. What then
says Antisthenes? Have you not heard? 'It is a royal
thing, O Cyrus, to do right (well) and to be ill spoken of.<note anchored="yes">M. Antoninus, vii. 36.</note>
My head is sound, and all think that I have the head ache.
What do I care for that? I am free from fever, and people
sympathize with me as if I had a fever, (and say), Poor
man, for so long a time you have not ceased to have fever.
I also say with a sorrowful countenance, In truth it is now
a long time that I have been ill. What will happen then?
As God may please: and at the same time I secretly laugh
at those who are pitying me. What then hinders the
same being done in this case also? I am poor, but I have
a right opinion about poverty. Why then do I care if
they pity me for my poverty? I am not in power (not a
magistrate); but others are: and I have the opinion which
I ought to have about having and not having power. Let
them look to it who pity me:<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o)/yontai</foreign>. See i. 4, note 4.</note> but I am neither hungry
nor thirsty nor do I suffer cold; but because they are
hungry or thirsty they think that I too am. What then
shall I do for them? Shall I go about and proclaim and
say, Be not mistaken, men, I am very well, I do not trouble
myself about poverty, nor want of power, nor in a word
about anything else than right opinions. These I have
free from restraint, I care for nothing at all.&mdash;What foolish
talk is this? How do I possess right opinions when I am
not content with being what I am, but am uneasy about
what I am supposed to be?</p>
<p>But you say, others will get more and be preferred to
me&mdash;What then is more reasonable than for those who
have laboured about any thing to have more in that thing
in which they have laboured? They have laboured for
power, you have laboured about opinions; and they have
laboured for wealth, you for the proper use of appearances.
<pb n="343"/>
See if they have more than you in this about which you
have laboured, and which they neglect; if they assent
better than you with respect to the natural rules (measures)
of things; if they are less disappointed than you in their
desires; if they fall less into things which they would
avoid than you do; if in their intentions, if in the things
which they propose to themselves, if in their purposes, if in
their motions towards an object they take a better aim; if
they better observe a proper behaviour, as men, as sons, as
parents, and so on as to the other names by which we
express the relations of life. But if they exercise power,
and you do not, will you not choose to tell yourself the
truth, that you do nothing for the sake of this (power), and
they do all? But it is most unreasonable that he who
looks after anything should obtain less than he who does
not look after it.</p>
<p>Not so: but since I care about right opinions, it is more
reasonable for me to have power.&mdash;Yes in the matter about
which you do care, in opinions. But in a matter in which
they have cared more than you, give way to them. The
case is just the same as if because you have right opinions,
you thought that in using the bow you should hit the
mark better than an archer, and in working in metal you
should succeed better than a smith. Give up then your
earnestness about opinions and employ yourself about the
things which you wish to acquire; and then lament, if
you do not succeed; for you deserve to lament. But now
you say that you are occupied with other things, that you
are looking after other things; but the many say this
truly, that one act has no community with another.<note anchored="yes">Schweig. says that he has not observed that this proverb is mentioned by any other writer, and that he does not quite see the meaning

conduce to happiness (<foreign lang="greek">eu)/roian</foreign>)? What have I done which
is either unfriendly or unsocial? what have I not done as

<p>So great then being the difference in desires, actions,
wishes, would you still have the same share with others in
those things about which you have not laboured, and they
have laboured? Then are you surprised if they pity you,
and are you vexed? But they are not vexed if you pity
them. Why? Because they are convinced that they have
that which is good, and you are not convinced. For this
reason you are not satisfied with your own, but you desire
that which they have: but they are satisfied with their
own, and do not desire what you have: since if you were
really convinced, that with respect to what is good, it is
you who are the possessor of it and that they have missed
it, you would not even have thought of what they say
about you.

<head>On freedom from fear.</head>
<p>WHAT makes the tyrant formidable? The guards, you
say, and their swords, and the men of the bedchamber and
those who exclude them who would enter. Why then if
you bring a boy (child) to the tyrant when he is with his
guards, is he not afraid; or is it because the child does
not understand these things? If then any man does
understand what guards are and that they have swords,
and comes to the tyrant for this very purpose because he
wishes to die on account of some circumstance and seeks
to die easily by the hand of another, is he afraid of the
guards? No, for he wishes for the thing which makes the
guards formidable. If then any man neither wishing to
die nor to live by all means, but only as it may be permitted, approaches the tyrant, what hinders him from
approaching the tyrant without fear? Nothing. If then
a man has the same opinion about his property as the man
whom I have instanced has about his body; and also about
his children and his wife: and in a word is so affected by
some madness or despair that he cares not whether he
possesses them or not, but like children who are playing
with shells care (quarrel) about the play, but do not trouble
themselves about the shells, so he too has set no value on
the materials (things), but values the pleasure that he has
with them and the occupation, what tyrant is then formidable to him or what guards or what swords?</p>
<p>Then through madness is it possible for a man to be so
disposed towards these things, and the Galilaeans through
habit,<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note on the text. By the Galilaeans it is probable
that Epictetus means the Christians, whose obstinacy Antoninus also
mentions (xi. 3). Epictetus, a contemporary of St. Paul, knew little
about the Christians, and only knew some examples of their obstinate
adherence to the new faith and the fanatical behaviour of some of the
converts. That there were wild fanatics among the early Christians is
proved on undoubted authority; and also that there always have been
such, and now are such. The abuse of any doctrines or religious
opinions is indeed no argument against such doctrines or religious
opinions; and it is a fact quite consistent with experience that the best
things are liable to be perverted, misunderstood, and misused.</note> and is it possible that no man can learn from reason
<pb n="346"/>
and from demonstration that God has made all the things
in the universe and the universe itself completely free
from hindrance and perfect, and the parts of it for the use
of the whole? All other animals indeed are incapable of
comprehending the administration of it; but the rational
animal man has faculties for the consideration of all these
things, and for understanding that it is a part, and what
kind of a part it is, and that it is right for the parts to be
subordinate to the whole. And besides this being naturally
noble, magnanimous and free, man sees that of the things
which surround him some are free from hindrance and in
his power, and the other things are subject to hindrance
and in the power of others; that the things which are free
from hindrance are in the power of the will; and those
which are subject to hindrance are the things which are
not in the power of the will. And for this reason if he
thinks that his good and his interest be in these things
only which are free from hindrance and in his own power,
he will be free, prosperous, happy, free from harm, magnanimous, pious, thankful to God<note anchored="yes">' This agrees with Eph. v. 20: <quote>Giving thanks always for all things
to God.'</quote> Mrs. Carter. The words are the same in both except that
the Apostle has <foreign lang="greek">eu)xaristou=ntes</foreign>, and Epictetus has <foreign lang="greek">xa/riu e)/xon</foreign>.</note> for all things; in no
matter finding fault with any of the things which have
not been put in his power, nor blaming any of them.<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note>
But if he thinks that his good and his interest are in
externals and in things which are not in the power of his
will, he must of necessity be hindered, be impeded, be a
slave to those who have the power over the things which
he admires (desires) and fears; and he must of necessity be
impious because he thinks that he is harmed by God, and
he must be unjust because he always claims more than
belongs to him; and he must of necessity be abject and
mean.</p>
<p>What hinders a man, who has clearly separated (comprehended) these things, from living with a light heart
and bearing easily the reins, quietly expecting every thing
which can happen, and enduring that which has already
happened? Would you have me to bear poverty? Come
and you will know what poverty is when it has found one
who can act well the part of a poor man. Would you
<pb n="347"/>
have me to possess power? Let me have power, and also
the trouble of it. Well, banishment? Wherever I shall go,
there it will be well with me; for here also where I am, it
was not because of the place that it was well with me, but
because of my opinions which I shall carry off with me:
for neither can any man deprive me of them; but my
opinions alone are mine and they cannot be taken from
me, and I am satisfied while I have them, wherever I may
be and whatever I am doing. But now it is time to die.
Why do you say to die? Make no tragedy show of the
thing, but speak of it as it is: it is now time for the
matter (of the body) to be resolved into the things out of
which it was composed. And what is the formidable
thing here? what is going to perish of the things which
are in the universe?<note anchored="yes">He says that the body will be resolved into the things of which it is
composed: none of them will perish. The soul, as he has said elsewhere,
will go to him who gave it (iii. 13. note 4). But I do not suppose that
he means that the soul will exist as having a separate consciousness.</note> what new thing or wondrous is
going to happen? Is it for this reason that a tyrant is
formidable? Is it for this reason that the guards appear
to have swords which are large and sharp? Say this to
others; but I have considered about all these things; no
man has power over me. I have been made free; I know
his commands, no man can now lead me as a slave. I
have a proper person to assert my freedom;<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">karpisth/n</foreign>, see iv. 1. 113.</note> I have proper
judges. (I say) are you not the master of my body?
What then is that to me? Are you not the master of my
property? What then is that to me? Are you not the
master of my exile or of my chains? Well, from all these
things and all the poor body itself I depart at your
bidding, when you please. Make trial of your power, and
you will know how far it reaches.</p>
<p>Whom then can I still fear? Those who are over the
bedchamber?<note anchored="yes">See i. 19. note 6.</note> Lest they should do, what? Shut me
out? If they find that I wish to enter, let them shut me
out. Why then do you go to the doors? Because I think
it befits me, while the play (sport) lasts, to join in it.
How then are you not shut out? Because unless some
<pb n="348"/>

Bp. Butler, Sermon on the Love of God.</note> I will
attach myself as a minister and follower to him; I have
the same movements (pursuits) as he has, I have the same
desires; in a word, I have the same will (<foreign lang="greek">sunfe/lw</foreign>). There
is no shutting out for me, but for those who would force
their way in. Why then do not I force my way in?
Because I know that nothing good is distributed within
to those who enter. But when I hear any man called
fortunate because he is honoured by Caesar, I say, what
does he happen to get? A province (the government of a
province). Does he also obtain an opinion such as he
ought? The office of a Prefect. Does he also obtain the
power of using his office well? Why do I still strive to
enter (Caesar's chamber)? A man scatters dried figs and
nuts: the children seize them, and fight with one another;
men do not, for they think them to be a small matter.
But if a man should throw about shells, even the children
do not seize them. Provinces are distributed: let children look to that. Money is distributed: let children
look to that. Praetorships, consulships are distributed:
let children scramble for them, let them be shut out,
beaten, kiss the hands of the giver, of the slaves: but to
me these are only dried figs and nuts. What then? If
you fail to get them, while Caesar is scattering them
about, do not be troubled: if a dried fig come into your
lap, take it and eat it; for so far you may value even a
fig. But if I shall stoop down and turn another over, or
be turned over by another, and shall flatter those who
have got into (Caesar's) chamber, neither is a dried fig
worth the trouble, nor any thing else of the things which
are not good, which the philosophers have persuaded me
not to think good.</p>
<p>Show me the swords of the guards. See how big they
are, and how sharp. What then do these big and sharp
<pb n="349"/>
swords do? They kill. And what does a fever do?
Nothing else. And what else a (falling) tile? Nothing
else. Would you then have me to wonder at these things
and worship them, and go about as the slave of all of
them? I hope that this will not happen: but when I
have once learned that every thing which has come into
existence must also go out of it, that the universe may not
stand still nor be impeded, I no longer consider it any
difference whether a fever shall do it or a tile, or a soldier.
But if a man must make a comparison between these
things, I know that the soldier will do it with less
trouble (to me), and quicker. When then I neither fear
any thing which a tyrant can do to me, nor desire any
thing which he can give, why do I still look on with
wonder (admiration)? Why am I still confounded?
Why do I fear the guards? Why am I pleased if he
speaks to me in a friendly way, and receives me, and
why do I tell others how he spoke to me? Is he a
Socrates, is he a Diogenes that his praise should be a proof
of what I am? Have I been eager to imitate his morals?
But I keep up the play and go to him, and serve him so
long as he does not bid me to do any thing foolish or unreasonable. But if he says to me, Go and bring Leon<note anchored="yes">See iv. 1. note 59.</note> of
Salamis, I say to him, Seek another, for I am no longer
playing. (The tyrant says): Lead him away (to prison).
I follow; that is part of the play. But your head will
be taken off&mdash;Does the tyrant's head always remain where
it is, and the heads of you who obey him?&mdash;But you will
be cast out unburied?&mdash;If the corpse is I, I shall be cast
out; but if I am different from the corpse, speak more
properly according as the fact is, and do not think of
frightening me. These things are formidable to children
and fools. But if any man has once entered a philosopher's
school and knows not what he is, he deserves to be full of
fear and to flatter those whom afterwards<note anchored="yes">I do not see the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">u(/steron</foreign>: it may perhaps mean 'after
leaving the school.' See Schweig.'s note.</note> he used to
flatter; (and) if he has not yet learned that he is not flesh
nor bones nor sinews (<foreign lang="greek">neu=ra</foreign>), but he is that which makes
<pb n="350"/>
use of these parts of the body and governs there and
follows (understands) the appearances of things.<note anchored="yes">Here Epictetus admits that there is some power in man which
uses the body, directs and governs it. He does not say what the power

<p>Yes, but this talk makes us despise the laws&mdash;And what
kind of talk makes men more obedient to the laws who
employ such talk? And the things which are in the
power of a fool are not law.<note anchored="yes">The will of a fool does not make law, he says. Unfortunately it
does, if we use the word law in the strict sense of law: for law is a
general command from a person, an absolute king, for example, who
has power to enforce it on those to whom the command is addressed
or if not to enforce it, to punish for disobedience to it. This strict use
of the word 'law' is independent of the quality of the command, which
may be wise or foolish, good or bad. But Epictetus does not use the
word 'law' in the strict sense.</note> And yet see how this talk
makes us disposed as we ought to be even to these men'
(fools); since it teaches us to claim in opposition to them
none of the things in which they are able to surpass us.
This talk teaches us as to the body to give it up, as to
property to give that up also, as to children, parents,
brothers, to retire from these, to give up all; it only
makes an exception of the opinions, which even Zeus has
willed to be the select property of every man. What
transgression of the laws is there here, what folly?
Where you are superior and stronger, there I gave way to

have not. It is your study to live in houses with floors
formed of various stones,<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">lifostrw/tois</foreign>, which means what we name Mosaic

they are connected, what powers it has, and of what kind?
Why then are you vexed, if another who has made it his
study, has the advantage over you in these things? But
these things are the greatest. And who hinders you from
being employed about these things and looking after them?
And who has a better stock of books, of leisure, of persons

this (the ruling faculty) such as you choose to have it,

<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Against those who hastily rush into the use of the philosophic dress.</head>
<p>NEVER praise nor blame a man because of the things
which are common (to all, or to most),<note anchored="yes">See iv. 4. 44.</note> and do not
ascribe to him any skill or want of skill; and thus you
will be free from rashness and from malevolence. This
man bathes very quickly. Does he then do wrong? Certainly not. But what does he do? He bathes very
<pb n="352"/>
quickly. Are all things then done well? By no means:
but the acts which proceed from right opinions are done
well; and those which proceed from bad opinions are done
ill. But do you, until you know the opinion from which
a man does each thing, neither praise nor blame the act.
But the opinion is not easily discovered from the external
things (acts). This man is a carpenter. Why? Because
he uses an axe. What then is this to the matter? This
man is a musician because he sings. And what does that
signify? This man is a philosopher. Because he wears a
cloak and long hair. And what does a juggler wear?
For this reason if a man sees any philosopher acting
indecently, immediately he says, See what the philosopher
is doing; but he ought because of the man's indecent
behaviour rather to say that he is not a philosopher. For
if this is the preconceived notion (<foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyis</foreign>) of a philosopher
and what he professes, to wear a cloak and long hair,
men would say well; but if what he professes is this
rather, to keep himself free from faults, why do we not
rather, because he does not make good his professions,
take from him the name of philosopher? For so we do in
the case of all other arts. When a man sees another
handling an axe badly, he does not say, what is the use
of the carpenter's art? See how badly carpenters do
their work; but he says just the contrary, This man is
not a carpenter, for he uses an axe badly. In the same
way if a man hears another singing badly, he does not
say, See how musicians sing; but rather, This man is not
a musician. But it is in the matter of philosophy only
that people do this. When they see a man acting contrary to the profession of a philosopher, they do not take
away his title, but they assume him to be a philosopher,
and from his acts deriving the fact that he is behaving
indecently they conclude that there is no use in philosophy.</p>
<p>What then is the reason of this? Because we attach
value to the notion (<foreign lang="greek">pro/lhyin</foreign>) of a carpenter, and to that
of a musician, and to the notion of other artisans in like
manner, but not to that of a philosopher, and we judge
from externals only that it is a thing confused and ill
defined. And what other kind of art has a name from the
<pb n="353"/>
dress and the hair; and has not both theorems and a
material and an end? What then is the material (matter)
of the philosopher? Is it a cloak? No, but reason. What
is his end? is it to wear a cloak? No, but to possess the
reason in a right state. Of what kind are his theorems?
Are they those about the way in which the beard becomes
great or the hair long? No, but rather what Zeno says,
to know the elements of reason, what kind of a thing each
of them is, and how they are fitted to one another, and
what things are consequent upon them. Will you not
then see first if he does what he professes when he acts
in an unbecoming manner, and then blame his study
(pursuit)? But now when you yourself are acting in a
sober way, you say in consequence of what he seems to
you to be doing wrong, Look at the philosopher, as if it
were proper to call by the name of philosopher one who
does these things; and further, This is the conduct of a
philosopher. But you do not say, Look at the carpenter,
when you know that a carpenter is an adulterer or you
see him to be a glutton; nor do you say, See the musician.
Thus to a certain degree even you perceive (understand)
the profession of a philosopher, but you fall away from the
notion, and you are confused through want of care.</p>
<p>But even the philosophers themselves as they are
called pursue the thing (philosophy) by beginning with
things which are common to them and others: as soon as
they have assumed a cloak and grown a beard, they say,
I am a philosopher.<note anchored="yes">Compare <cit><bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.19.12">Horace, Ep. i 19, 12 etc.</bibl>
<quote lang="la"><lg><l>Quid, si quis vultu torvo ferus et pede nudo</l>
<l>Exiguaeque togae simulet textore Catonem,</l>
<l>Virtutemne reprs aentet moresque Catonis?</l></lg></quote></cit></note> But no man will say, I am a
musician, if he has bought a plectrum (fiddlestick) and
a lute: nor will he say, I am a smith, if he has put on
a cap and apron. But the dress is fitted to the art; and
they take their name from the art, and not from the
dress. For this reason Euphrates<note anchored="yes">See iii. 15. 8</note> used to say well, A
long time I strove to be a philosopher without people
knowing it; and this, he said, was useful to me: for first
I knew that when I did any thing well, I did not do it
<pb n="354"/>
for the sake of the spectators, but for the sake of myself:
I ate well for the sake of myself; I had my countenance
well composed and my walk: all for myself and for God.
Then, as I struggled alone, so I alone also was in danger:
in no respect through me, if I did anything base or unbecoming, was philosophy endangered; nor did I injure the
many by doing any thing wrong as a philosopher. For
this reason those who did not know my purpose used to
wonder how it was that while I conversed and lived
altogether with all philosophers, I was not a philosopher
myself. And what was the harm for me to be known to
be a philosopher by my acts and not by outward marks?<note anchored="yes"><quote>Yea a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my
works,</quote> Epistle of James, ii. 18. So a moral philosopher may say, I
show my principles, not by what I profess, but by that which I do.</note>
See how I eat, how I drink, how I sleep, how I bear and
forbear, how I co-operate, how I employ desire, how I
employ aversion (turning from things), how I maintain
the relations (to things) those which are natural or those
which are acquired, how free from confusion, how free
from hindrance. Judge of me from this, if you can. But
if you are so deaf and blind that you cannot conceive even
Hephaestus<note anchored="yes">See the statues of Hephaestus, Montfaucon, Antiq. vol. i. lib. iii.
c. 1. Upton.</note> to be a good smith, unless you see the cap on
his head, what is the harm in not being recognized by so
foolish a judge?</p>
<p>So Socrates was not known to be a philosopher by most
persons; and they used to come to him and ask to be introduced to philosophers. Was he vexed then as we are,
and did he say, And do you not think that I am a philo-
sopher? No, but he would take them and introduce them,
being satisfied with one thing, with being a philosopher;
and being pleased also with not being thought to be a
philosopher, he was not annoyed: for he thought of his
own occupation. What is the work of an honourable and
good man? To have many pupils? By no means. They
will look to this matter who are earnest about it. But
was it his business to examine carefully difficult theorems?
Others will look after these matters also, In what then
<pb n="355"/>
was he,<note anchored="yes">'In what then was he' seems to mean 'in what did he employ
himself'?</note> and who was he and whom did he wish to be? He
was in that (employed in that) wherein there was hurt
(damage) and advantage. If any man can damage me, he
says, I am doing nothing: if I am waiting for another man
to do me good, I am nothing. If I wish for any thing, and
it does not happen, I am unfortunate. To such a contest
he invited every man, and I do not think that he would
have declined the contest with any one.<note anchored="yes">The text of Schweighaeuser is <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n moi dokh=| e)ksth=nai ou)deni/</foreign>. he
says 'temere <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n moi dokei=</foreign> ed. Bas. et seqq.' But <foreign lang="greek">dokei=</foreign> is right.</note> What do you
suppose? was it by proclaiming and saying, I am such a
man? Far from it, but by being such a man. For
further, this is the character of a fool and a boaster to
say, I am free from passions and disturbance: do not
be ignorant, my friends, that while you are uneasy and
disturbed about things of no value, I alone am free from
all perturbation. So is it not enough for you to feel no
pain, unless you make this proclamation: Come together
all who are suffering gout, pains in the head, fever, ye
who are lame, blind, and observe that I am sound (free)
from every ailment&mdash;This is empty and disagreeable to
hear, unless like Aesculapius you are able to show immediately by what kind of treatment they also shall be
immediately free from disease, and unless you show your
own health as an example.</p>
<p>For such is the Cynic who is honoured with the sceptre
and the diadem by Zeus, and says, That you may see,
O men, that you seek happiness and tranquillity not where
it is, but where it is not, behold I am sent to you by God
as an example,<note anchored="yes">Compare iii. c. 22.</note> I who have neither property nor house,
nor wife nor children, not even a bed, nor coat nor household utensil; and see how healthy 1 am: try me, and if
you see that I am free from perturbations, hear the remedies and how I have been cured (treated). This is both
philanthropic and noble. But see whose work it is, the
work of Zeus, or of him whom he may judge worthy of
this service, that he may never exhibit any thing to the
many, by which he shall make of no effect his own tes-
<pb n="356"/>
timony,&mdash;whereby he gives testimony to virtue, and bears
evidence against external things:
<quote rend="blockquote">His beauteous face pales not, nor from his cheeks
He wipes a tear.&mdash;Odyssey, xi. 528</quote>
And not this only, but he neither desires nor seeks any
thing, nor man nor place nor amusement, as children seek
the vintage or holidays; always fortified by modesty as
others are fortified by walls and doors and doorkeepers.</p>
<p>But now (these men) being only moved to philosophy,
as those who have a bad stomach are moved to some kinds
of food which they soon loathe, straightway (rush) towards the sceptre and to the royal power. They let the
hair grow, they assume the cloak, they show the shoulder
bare, they quarrel with those whom they meet; and if
they see a man in a thick winter coat,<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">faino/lh</foreign>, which seems to be the Latin 'paenula.'</note> they quarrel with
him. Man, first exercise yourself in winter weather: see
your movements (inclinations) that they are not those of
a man with a bad stomach or those of a longing woman.
First strive that it be not known what you are: be a
philosopher to yourself (or, philosophize to yourself) a
short time. Fruit grows thus: the seed must be buried
for some time, hid, grow slowly in order that it may come
to perfection. But if it produces the ear before the
jointed stem, it is imperfect, a produce of the garden of
Adonis.<note anchored="yes">'The gardens of Adonis' are things growing in earthen vessels,
carried about for show only, not for use. 'The gardens of Adonis' is
a proverbial expression applied to things of no value, to plants, for
instance, which last only a short time, have no roots, and soon wither.
Much things, we may suppose, were exhibited at the festivals of Adonis.
Schweig.'s note.</note> Such a poor plant are you also: you have
blossomed too soon; the cold weather will scorch you up.
See what the husbandmen say about seeds when there is
warm weather too early. They are afraid lest the seeds
should be too luxuriant, and then a single frost should lay
hold of them and show that they are too forward. Do you
also consider, my man: you have shot out too soon, you
have hurried towards a little fame before the proper
<pb n="357"/>
season: you think that you are something, a fool among
fools: you will be caught by the frost, and rather you
have been frost-bitten in the root below, but your upper
parts still blossom a little, and for this reason you think
that you are still alive and flourishing. Allow us to
ripen in the natural way: why do you bare (expose) us?
why do you force us? we are not yet able to bear the air.
Let the root grow, then acquire the first joint, then the
second, and then the third: in this way then the fruit
will naturally force itself out,<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> even if I do not choose.
For who that is pregnant and filled with such great
principles does not also perceive his own powers and
move towards the corresponding acts? A bull is not
ignorant of his own nature and his powers, when a wild
beast shows itself, nor does he wait for one to urge him
on; nor a dog when he sees a wild animal. But if I have
the powers of a good man, shall I wait for you to prepare
me for my own (proper) acts? At present I have them
not, believe me. Why then do you wish me to be
withered up before the time, as you have been withered
up?</p></div2>

<p>WHEN you see another man in the possession of power
(magistracy), set against this the fact that you have not
the want (desire) of power; when you see another rich,
see what you possess in place of riches: for if you possess
nothing in place of them, you are miserable; but if you
have not the want of riches, know that you possess more
than this man possesses and what is worth much more.
Another man possesses a handsome woman (wife): you
<pb n="358"/>
have the satisfaction of not desiring a handsome wife. Do
these things appear to you to be small? And how much
would these persons give, these very men who are rich, and
in possession of power, and live with handsome women, to
be able to despise riches, and power and these very women
whom they love and enjoy? Do you not know then what
is the thirst of a man who has a fever? He possesses that
which is in no degree like the thirst of a man who is in
health: for the man who is in health ceases to be thirsty
after he has drunk; but the sick man being pleased for a
short time has a nausea, he converts the drink into bile,
vomits, is griped, and more thirsty. It is such a thing to
have desire of riches and to possess riches, desire of power
and to possess power, desire of a beautiful woman and to
sleep with her: to this is added jealousy, fear of being
deprived of the thing which you love, indecent words,
indecent thoughts, unseemly acts.</p>
<p>And what do I lose? you will say. My man, you were
modest, and you are so no longer. Have you lost nothing?
In place of Chrysippus and Zeno you read Aristides and
Evenus;<note anchored="yes">Aristides was a Greek, but his period is not known. He was the
author of a work named Milesiaca or Milesian stories. All that we
know of the work is that it was of a loose description, amatory and
licentious. It was translated into Latin by L. Cornelius Sisenna, a
contemporary of the Dictator Sulla; and it is mentioned by Plutarch
(Life of Crassus, c. 32), and several times by Ovid (<bibl n="Ov. Tr. 2.413">Tristia ii. 413 etc.</bibl>).
Evenus was perhaps a poet. We know nothing of this Evenus, but we
may conjecture from being here associated with Aristides what his
character was.</note> have you lost nothing? In place of Socrates
and Diogenes, you admire him who is able to corrupt and
seduce most women. You wish to appear handsome and
try to make yourself so, though you are not. You like to
display splendid clothes that you may attract women;
and if you find any fine oil (for the hair),<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note on the word <foreign lang="greek">muraleifi/on</foreign>, which he has in his
text. It should be <foreign lang="greek">muraloifi/on</foreign>, if the word exists.</note> you imagine
that you are happy. But formerly you did not think of
any such thing, but only where there should be decent
talk, a worthy man, and a generous conception. Therefore you slept like a man, walked forth like a man, wore a
manly dress, and used to talk in a way becoming a good
<pb n="359"/>
man; then do you say to me, I have lost nothing? So do
men lose nothing more than coin? Is not modesty lost?
Is not decent behaviour lost? is it that he who has lost
these things has sustained no loss? Perhaps you think
that not one of these things is a loss. But there was a
time when you reckoned this the only loss and damage,
and you were anxious that no man should disturb you
from these (good) words and actions.</p>
<p>Observe, you are disturbed from these good words and
actions by nobody, but by yourself. Fight with yourself,
restore yourself to decency, to modesty, to liberty. If any
man ever told you this about me, that a person forces me
to be an adulterer, to wear such a dress as yours, to perfume myself with oils, would you not have gone and with
your own hand have killed the man who thus calumniated
me? Now will you not help yourself? and how much
easier is this help? There is no need to kill any man,
nor to put him in chains, nor to treat him with contumely
nor to enter the Forum (go to the courts of law), but it is
only necessary for you to speak to yourself who will be
most easily persuaded, with whom no man has more power
of persuasion than yourself. First of all, condemn what
you are doing, and then when you have condemned it, do
not despair of yourself, and be not in the condition of
those men of mean spirit, who, when they have once
given in, surrender themselves completely and are carried
away as if by a torrent. But see what the trainers of boys
do. Has the boy fallen? Rise, they say, wrestle again
till you are made strong. Do you also do something of
the same kind: for be well assured that nothing is more
tractable than the human soul. You must exercise the
Will,<note anchored="yes">The orginal is <foreign lang="greek">felh=sai dei=</foreign>. Seneca (Ep. 80): 'Quid tibi opus est

<p>The power of the Will is a fundamental principle with Epictetus.
The will is strong in some, but very feeble in others; and sometimes,
as experience seems to show, it is incapable of resisting the power of
old habits.</p></note>and the thing is done, it is set right: as on the
other hand, only fall a nodding (be careless), and the
thing is lost: for from within comes ruin and from within
comes help. Then (you say) what good do I gain? And
<pb n="360"/>
what greater good do you seek than this?<note anchored="yes">Virtue is its own reward, said the Stoics. This is the meaning of
Epictetus, and it is consistent with his principles that a man should
live conformably to his nature, and so he will have all the happiness of
which human nature is capable. Mrs. Carter has a note here, which I
do not copy, and I hardly understand. It seems to refer to the Christian
doctrine of a man being rewarded in a future life according to his
works: but we have no evidence that Epictetus believed in a future
life, and he therefore could not go further than to maintain that
virtuous behaviour is the best thing in this short life, and will give a
man the happiness which he can obtain in no other way.</note> From a shameless man you will become a modest man, from a disorderly
you will become an orderly man, from a faithless you will
become a faithful man, from a man of unbridled habits a
sober man. If you seek any thing more than this, go on doing
what you are doing: not even a God can now help you.</p></div2>

<head>What things we ought to despise, and what things we ought to value.</head>
<p>THE difficulties of all men are about external things, their
helplessness is about externals. What shall I do, how
will it be, how will it turn out, will this happen, will
that? All these are the words of those who are turning
themselves to things which are not within the power of
the will. For who says, How shall I not assent to that
which is false? how shall I not turn away from the
truth? If a man be of such a good disposition as to be
anxious about these things, I will remind him of this,
Why are you anxious? The thing is in your own power:
be assured: do not be precipitate in assenting before you
apply the natural rule. On the other side, if a man is
anxious (uneasy) about desire, lest it fail in its purpose
and miss its end, and with respect to the avoidance of
things, lest he should fall into that which he would
avoid, I will first kiss (love) him, because he throws away
the things about which others are in a flutter (others
<pb n="361"/>
desire) and their fears, and employs his thoughts about
his own affairs and his own condition. Then I shall say
to him, if you do not choose to desire that which you will
fail to obtain nor to attempt to avoid that into which you
will fall, desire nothing which belongs to (which is in the
power of) others, nor try to avoid any of the things which
are not in your power. If you do not observe this rule,
you must of necessity fail in your desires and fall into
that which you would avoid. What is the difficulty here?
where is there room for the words, How will it be? and
How will it turn out? and will this happen or that?</p>
<p>Now is not that which will happen independent of
the will? Yes. And the nature of good and of evil is it
not in the things which are within the power of the will?
Yes. Is it in your power then to treat according to
nature every thing which happens? Can any person
hinder you? No man. No longer then say to me, How
will it be? For however it may be, you will dispose of
it well,<note anchored="yes">See a passage in Plutarch on Tranquillity from Euripides, the great
storehouse of noble thoughts, from which antient writers drew much

What would Hercules have been if he said, How shall a
great lion not appear to me, or a great boar, or savage
men? And what do you care for that? If a great boar
appear, you will fight a greater fight: if bad men appear,
you will relieve the earth of the bad. Suppose then that
I lose my life in this way. You will die a good man,
doing a noble act. For since we must certainly die, of
necessity a man must be found doing something, either
following the employment of a husbandman, or digging, or
trading, or serving in a consulship or suffering from
indigestion or from diarrhoea. What then do you wish
to be doing when you are found by death? I for my
part would wish to be found doing something which
belongs to a man, beneficent, suitable to the general
interest, noble. But if I cannot be found doing things
so great, I would be found doing at least that which I
<pb n="362"/>
cannot be hindered from doing, that which is permitted
me to do, correcting myself, cultivating the faculty which
makes use of appearances, labouring at freedom from the
affects (labouring at tranquillity of mind), rendering to
the relations of life their due; if I succeed so far, also
(I would be found) touching on (advancing to) the third
topic (or head) safety in the forming judgments about
things.<note anchored="yes">See iii. c. 2.</note> If death surprises me when I am busy about
these things, it is enough for me if I can stretch out my
hands to God and say: The means which I have received

ever blamed thee? have I been discontented with any
thing that happens, or wished it to be otherwise? have
I wished to transgress the (established) relations (of
things)? That thou hast given me life, I thank thee
for what thou hast given: so long as I have used the
things which are thine I am content; take them back
and place them wherever thou mayest choose; for thine

Mrs. Carter.</note>&mdash;Is it not
enough to depart in this state of mind, and what life is
better and more becoming than that of a man who is in
this state of mind? and what end is more happy?<note anchored="yes">' I wish it were possible to palliate the ostentation of this passage,
by applying it to the ideal perfect character: but it is in a general
way that Epictetus hath proposed such a dying speech, as cannot
without shocking arrogance be uttered by any one born to die. Unmixed as it is with any acknowledgment of faults or imperfections, at
present, or with any sense of guilt on account of the past, it must give
every sober reader a very disadvantageous opinion of some principles
of the philosophy, on which it is founded, as contradictory to the voice
of conscience, and formed on absolute ignorance or neglect of the condition and circumstances of such a creature as man.' Mrs. Carter.
<p>I am inclined to think that Epictetus does refer to the 'ideal perfect
character'; but others may not understand him in this way. When
Mrs. Carter says' but it is in a general . . . dying speech,' she can hardly
suppose, as her words seem to mean, that Epictetus proposed such a
dying speech for every man or even for many men, for he knew and
has told us how bad many men are, and how few are good according
to his measure and rule: in fact his meaning is plainly expressed. The dying speech may even be stronger in the sense in which Mrs. Carter
understands it, in my translation, where I have rendered one passage
in the text by the words' I have not dishonoured thee by my acts,'
which she translates, 'as far as in me lay, I have not dishonoured
thee;' which apparently means, 'as far as I could, I have not dishonoured thee.' The Latin translation 'quantum in me fuit,' seems
rather ambiguous to me.</p>
<p>There is a general confession of sins in the prayer book of the
Church of England, part of which Epictetus would not have rejected,
I think. Of course the words which form the peculiar Christian character of the confession would have been unintelligible to him. It is
a confession which all persons of all conditions are supposed to make.
If all persons made the confession with sincerity, it ought to produce
a corresponding behaviour and make men more ready to be kind to one
another, for all who use it confess that they fail in their duty, and it
ought to lower pride and banish arrogance from the behaviour of those
who in wealth and condition are elevated above the multitude. But I
have seen it somewhere said, I cannot remember where, but said in no
friendly spirit to Christian prayer, that some men both priests and
laymen prostrate themselves in humility before God and indemnify
themselves by arrogance to man.</p></note>
<pb n="363"/></p>
<p>But that this may be done (that such a declaration may
be made), a man must receive (bear) no small things, nor
are the things small which he must lose (go without).
You cannot both wish to be a consul and to have these
things (the power of making such a dying speech), and to
be eager to have lands, and these things also; and to be
solicitous about slaves and about yourself. But if you
wish for any thing which belongs to another, that which
is your own is lost. This is the nature of the thing:
nothing is given or had for nothing.<note anchored="yes">See iv. 2. 2.</note> And where is the
wonder? If you wish to be a consul, you must keep
awake, run about, kiss hands, waste yourself with exhaustion at other men's doors, say and do many things
unworthy of a free man, send gifts to many, daily
presents to some. And what is the thing that is got?
Twelve bundles of rods (the consular fasces), to sit three
or four times on the tribunal, to exhibit the games in the
Circus and to give suppers in small baskets.<note anchored="yes">These were what the Romans named 'sportul&aelig;,' in which the rich

is besides these things. In order then to secure freedom
from passions (<foreign lang="greek">a)pafei/as</foreign>), tranquillity, to sleep well when
you do sleep, to be really awake when you are awake, to
fear nothing, to be anxious about nothing, will you spend
nothing and give no labour? But if any thing belonging
to you be lost while you are thus busied, or be wasted
badly, or another obtains what you ought to have
obtained, will you immediately be vexed at what has
happened? Will you not take into the account on the
other side what you receive and for what, how much for
how much? Do you expect to have for nothing things so
great? And how can you? One work (thing) has no
community with another. You cannot have both external
things after bestowing care on them and your own ruling
faculty:<note anchored="yes"><quote>You cannot serve God and Mammon.</quote> Matthew vi. 24. Mrs.

you do not, you will have neither this nor that, while you
are drawn in different ways to both.<note anchored="yes">See iv. 2, 5.</note> The oil will be

nature&mdash;Well; but I shall have nothing to eat. If I am
so unlucky, death is a harbour; and death is the harbour
for all; this is the place of refuge; and for this reason
not one of the things in life is difficult: as soon as you
choose, you are out of the house, and are smoked no more.<note anchored="yes">Compare i. 25, 18, and i. 9, 20.</note>
Why then are you anxious, why do you lose your sleep,
why do you not straightway, after considering wherein
your good is and your evil, say, Both of them are in my
power? Neither can any man deprive me of the good,
nor involve me in the bad against my will. Why do I
not throw myself down and snore? for all that I have is
safe. As to the things which belong to others, he will
look to them who gets them, as they may be given by
him who has the power.<note anchored="yes">See the note in Schweig.'s ed.</note> Who am I who wish to have
<pb n="365"/>
them in this way or in that? is a power of selecting them
given to me? has any person made me the dispenser of
them? Those things are enough for me over which I
have power: I ought to manage them as well as I can:
and all the rest, as the master of them (God) may choose.</p>
<p>When a man has these things before his eyes, does he
keep awake and turn hither and thither? What would
he have, or what does he regret, Patroclus or Antilochus

is lamenting the death of Patroclus and cannot sleep.</note> For when did he suppose that any of his

Automedon<note anchored="yes"><quote>This is a wretched idea of friendship; but a necessary consequence
of the Stoic system. What a fine contrast to this gloomy consolation
are the noble sentiments of an Apostle? Value your deceased friend,
says Epictetus, as a broken pipkin; forget him, as a thing worthless,
lost and destroyed. St. Paul, on the contrary, comforts the mourning
survivors; bidding them not sorrow, as those who have no hope: but
remember that the death of good persons is only a sleep; from which
they will soon arise to a happy immortality.</quote> Mrs. Carter.
<p>Epictetus does not say, 'value your deceased friend as a broken
pipkin.' Achilles laments that he has lost the services of his friend at
table, a vulgar kind of complaint: he is thinking of his own loss,
instead of his friend. The answer is such a loss as he laments is easily
repaired: the loss of such a friend is as easily repaired as the loss of a
cooking vessel. Mrs. Carter in her zeal to contrast the teaching of the
Apostle with that of Epictetus seems to forget for the time that Epictetus,
so far as we know, did not accept or did not teach the doctrine of a
future life. As to what he thought of friendship, if it was a real
friendship, such as we can conceive, I am sure that he did not think of
it, as Mrs. Carter says that he did; for true friendship implies many of
the virtues which Epictetus taught and practised. He has a chapter
on Friendship, ii. 22, which I suppose that Mrs. Carter did not think
of, when she wrote this note.</p></note> will set it before you, and if Automedon also

<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<head>About purity (cleanliness).</head>
<p>SOME persons raise a question whether the social feeling<note anchored="yes">The word is <foreign lang="greek">to\ koinwnikon</foreign>. Compare i. 23, 1, ii 10, 14, ii. 20, 6</note>
is contained in the nature of man; and yet I think that
these same persons would have no doubt that love of
purity is certainly contained in it, and that if man is
distinguished from other animals by any thing, he is distinguished by this. When then we see any other animal
cleaning itself, we are accustomed to speak of the act
with surprise, and to add that the animal is acting like a
man: and on the other hand, if a man blames an animal
for being dirty, straightway as if we were making an
excuse for it, we say that of course the animal is not a
human creature. So we suppose that there is something
superior in man, and that we first receive it from the
Gods. For since the Gods by their nature are pure and
free from corruption, so far as men approach them by
reason, so far do they cling to purity and to a love (habit)
<pb n="367"/>
of purity. But since it is impossible that man's nature
(<foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>) can be altogether pure being mixed (composed) of
such materials, reason is applied, as far as it is possible,
and reason endeavours to make human nature love
purity.<note anchored="yes">In the text there are two words, <foreign lang="greek">kafaro/s</foreign> which means 'pure,' and
<foreign lang="greek">kafa/rios</foreign> which means 'of a pure nature,' 'loving purity.'</note></p>
<p>The first then and highest purity is that which is in the
soul; and we say the same of impurity. Now you could
not discover the impurity of the soul as you could discover that of the body: but as to the soul, what else
could you find in it than that which makes it filthy in
respect to the acts which are her own? Now the acts of
the soul are movement towards an object or movement
from it, desire, aversion, preparation, design (purpose),
assent. What then is it which in these acts makes the
soul filthy and impure? Nothing else than her own bad
judgments (<foreign lang="greek">kri/mata</foreign>). Consequently the impurity of the
soul is the soul's bad opinions; and the purification of the
soul is the planting in it of proper opinions; and the
soul is pure which has proper opinions, for the soul
alone in her own acts is free from perturbation and
pollution.</p>
<p>Now we ought to work at something like this in the
body also, as far as we can. It was impossible for the
defluxions of the nose not to run when man has such a
mixture in his body. For this reason nature has made
hands and the nostrils themselves as channels for carrying
off the humours. If then a man sucks up the defluxions,
I say that he is not doing the act of a man. It was impossible for a man's feet not to be made muddy and not
be soiled at all when he passes through dirty places. For
this reason nature (God) has made water and hands. It
was impossible that some impurity should not remain in
the teeth from eating: for this reason, she says, wash the
teeth. Why? In order that you may be a man and not
a wild beast or a hog. It was impossible that from the
sweat and the pressing of the clothes there should not
remain some impurity about the body which requires to
be cleaned away. For this reason water, oil, hands,
<pb n="368"/>
towels, scrapers (strigils),<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="greek">cu/stra</foreign>, as Epictetus names it, was the Roman 'strigilis,'
which was used for the scraping and cleaning of the body in bathing

<lg>
<l>'I, puer, et strigiles Crispini ad balnea defer.'</l></lg>
The strigiles <quote>were of bronze or iron of various forms. They were
applied to the body much in the same way as we see a piece of hoop
applied to a sweating horse.</quote> Pompeii, edited by Dr. Dyer.</note> nitre, sometimes all other kinds
of means are necessary for cleaning the body. You do
not act so: but the smith will take off the rust from the
iron (instruments), and he will have tools prepared for
this purpose, and you yourself wash the platter when you
are going to eat, if you are not completely impure and
dirty: but will you not wash the body nor make it clean?
Why? he replies. I will tell you again; in the first place,
that you may do the acts of a man; then, that you may
not be disagreeable to those with whom you associate.
You do something of this kind even<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note.</note> in this matter, and
you do not perceive it: you think that you deserve to
stink. Let it be so: deserve to stink. Do you think
that also those who sit by you, those who recline at table
with you, that those who kiss you deserve the same?<note anchored="yes">See Schweig.'s note. If the text is right, the form of expression is
inexact and does not clearly express the meaning; but the meaning
may be easily discovered.</note>
Either go into a desert, where you deserve to go, or live
by yourself, and smell yourself. For it is just that you
alone should enjoy your own impurity. But when you
are in a city, to behave so inconsiderately and foolishly,
to what character do you think that it belongs? If
nature had entrusted to you a horse, would you have overlooked and neglected him? And now think that you have
been entrusted with your own body as with a horse;
wash it, wipe it, take care that no man turns away from
it, that no one gets out of the way for it. But who does
not get out of the way of a dirty man, of a stinking man,
of a man whose skin is foul, more than he does out of the
way of a man who is daubed with muck? That smell is
from without, it is put upon him; but the other smell is
<pb n="369"/>
from want of care, from within, and in a manner from a
body in putrefaction.</p>
<p>But Socrates washed himself seldom&mdash;Yes, but his body
was clean and fair: and it was so agreeable and sweet
that the most beautiful and the most noble loved him, and
desired to sit by him rather than by the side of those who
had the handsomest forms. It was in his power neither to
use the bath nor to wash himself, if he chose; and yet the
rare use of water had an effect. [If you do not choose to
wash with warm water, wash with cold.<note anchored="yes">See what is said of this passage in the latter part of this chapter.</note>] But Aristophanes says

For Aristophanes says of Socrates that he also walked the

trouble and more happily than all of noble birth and than
the rich. But look at my poor body also and observe that
it is not injured by my hard way of living&mdash;But if a man
says this to me, who has the appearance (dress) and face
of a condemned man, what God shall persuade me to
approach philosophy, if<note anchored="yes">On the word <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> Schweig.'s note.</note> it makes men such persons?
Far from it; I would not choose to do so, even if I
<pb n="370"/>
were going to become a wise man. I indeed would rather
that a young man, who is making his first movements
towards philosophy, should come to me with his hair
carefully trimmed than with it dirty and rough, for
there is seen in him a certain notion (appearance) of
beauty and a desire of (attempt at) that which is becoming; and where he supposes it to be, there also he
strives that it shall be. It is only necessary to show him
(what it is), and to say: Young man, you seek beauty,
and you do well: you must know then that it (is produced) grows in that part of you where you have the
rational faculty: seek it there where you have the movements towards and the movements from things, where
you have the desires towards, and the aversion from things:
for this is what you have in yourself of a superior kind;
but the poor body is naturally only earth: why do you
labour about it to no purpose? if you shall learn nothing
else, you will learn from time that the body is nothing.
But if a man comes to me daubed with filth, dirty, with a
moustache down to his knees, what can I say to him, by
what kind of resemblance can I lead him on? For about
what has he busied himself which resembles beauty, that
I may be able to change him and say, Beauty is not in
this, but in that? Would you have me to tell him, that
beauty consists not in being daubed with muck, but that
it lies in the rational part? Has he any desire of beauty?
has he any form of it in his mind? Go and talk to a hog,
and tell him not to roll in the mud.</p>
<p>For this reason the words of Xenocrates touched Polemon also, since he was a lover of beauty, for he entered
(the room) having in him certain incitements (<foreign lang="greek">e)nau/smata</foreign>)
to love of beauty, but he looked for it in the wrong
place.<note anchored="yes">As to Polemon see iii. c. 1, 14.</note> For nature has not made even the animals dirty
which live with man. Does a horse ever wallow in the
mud, or a well bred dog? But the hog, and the dirty
geese, and worms and spiders do, which are banished
furthest from human intercourse. Do you then being a
man choose to be not as one of the animals which
live with man, but rather a worm, or a spider? Will

manner as you choose?<note anchored="yes">It has been suggested that the words s. 19, [if you do not choose

with whom you keep company may have pleasure in
being with you? But do you go with us even into the
temples in such a state, where it is not permitted to spit
or blow the nose, being a heap of spittle and of snot?</p>
<p>What then? does any man (that is, do I) require you
to ornament yourself? Far from it; except to ornament
that which we really are by nature, the rational faculty,
the opinions, the actions; but as to the body only so far as
purity, only so far as not to give offence. But if you are
told that you ought not to wear garments dyed with
purple, go and daub your cloak with muck or tear it.<note anchored="yes">This is the literal translation: but it means, 'will you go, etc.,

<p>WHEN you have remitted your attention for a short time,
do not imagine this, that you will recover it when you
choose; but let this thought be present to you, that in
consequence of the fault committed to-day your affairs
must be in a worse condition for all that follows. For
first, and what causes most trouble, a habit of not attending is formed in you; then a habit of deferring your
attention. And continually from time to time you drive

is done better by those who do not use attention? Does
he who works in wood work better by not attending to
it? Does the captain of a ship manage it better by not
attending? and is any of the smaller acts done better by
inattention? Do you not see that when you have let your
mind loose, it is no longer in your power to recall it,
either to propriety, or to modesty, or to moderation: but
you do every thing that comes into your mind in obedience to your inclinations.</p>
<p>To what things then ought I to attend? First to those

master of another man's will, but that in the will alone is
the good and the bad. No man then has the power either
to procure for me any good or to involve me in any evil,
but I alone myself over myself have power in these
things. When then these things are secured to me, why
need I be disturbed about external things? What tyrant
is formidable, what disease, what poverty, what offence

not care for any man who says any thing else (different):
in sophistical argument, I care for no man. Why then
in greater matters do those annoy me who blame me?
What is the cause of this perturbation? Nothing else
than because in this matter (topic) I am not disciplined.
For all knowledge (science) despises ignorance and the
ignorant; and not only the sciences, but even the arts.

the many in respect to his own work<note anchored="yes">Compare ii. 13, 15 and 20; and Antoninus, vi. 35: 'Is it not

<p>First then we ought to have these (rules) in readiness,
and to do nothing without them, and we ought to keep
the soul directed to this mark, to pursue nothing external,
and nothing which belongs to others (or is in the power
of others), but to do as he has appointed who has the

power; we ought to pursue altogether the things which
are in the power of the will, and all other things as it is
permitted. Next to this we ought to remember who we
are,<note anchored="yes">'Quid sumus, aut quidnam victuri gignimur.' Persius, Sat. iii. 67.</note> and what is our name, and to endeavour to direct our
duties towards the character (nature) of our several relations (in life) in this manner: what is the season for
singing, what is the season for play, and in whose
presence; what will be the consequence of the act;<note anchored="yes">Schweig. thinks that the text will be better translated according
to Upton's notion and H. Stephen's (hors de propos) by 'Quid sit abs

ridicule; and on what occasion to comply and with
whom; and finally, in complying how to maintain our
own character.<note anchored="yes">See iii. 14, 7, . 29, 64.</note> But wherever you have deviated from
any of these rules, there is damage immediately, not from
any thing external, but from the action itself.</p>
<p>What then? is it possible to be free from faults, (if you
do all this)? It is not possible; but this is possible,
to direct your efforts incessantly to being faultless. For
we must be content if by never remitting this attention
we shall escape at least a few errors. But now when you
have said, To-morrow I will begin to attend, you must be
told that you are saying this, To-day I will be shameless,
disregardful of time and place, mean; it will be in the
power of others to give me pain; to-day I will be
passionate, and envious. See how many evil things you
are permitting yourself to do. If it is good to use attention to-morrow, how much better is it to do so to-day? if
to-morrow it is in your interest to attend, much more is
it to-day, that you may be able to do so to-morrow also,
and may not defer it again to the third day.<note anchored="yes">Compare Antoninus, viii. 22: <quote>Attend to the matter which is

secrets and we think this to be candid behaviour? In the
first place because it seems unfair for a man to have
listened to the affairs of his neighbour, and not to communicate to him also in turn our own affairs: next,
because we think that we shall not present to them the
appearance of candid men when we are silent about our
own affairs. Indeed men are often accustomed to say,
I have told you all my affairs, will you tell me nothing
of your own? where is this done?&mdash;Besides, we have also
this opinion that we can safely trust him who has already
told us his own affairs; for the notion rises in our mind
that this man could never divulge our affairs because he
would be cautious that we also should not divulge his. In
this way also the incautious are caught by the soldiers at
Rome. A soldier sits by you in a common dress and
begins to speak ill of Caesar; then you, as if you had
received a pledge of his fidelity by his having begun the
abuse, utter yourself also what you think, and then you
are carried off in chains.<note anchored="yes">The man, whether a soldier or not, was an informer, one of those
vile men who carried on this shameful business under the empire. He
was what Juvenal names a 'delator.' Upton, who refers to the life of
Hadrian by Aelius Spartianus, speaks even of this emperor employing
soldiers named Frumentarii for the purpose of discovering what was
said and done in private houses. John the Baptist (Luke iii. 14) in
answer to the question of the soldiers, 'And what shall we do?' said
unto them 'Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be
content with your wages.' Upton.</note></p>
<p>Something of this kind happens to us also generally.
Now as this man has confidently intrusted his affairs to
me, shall I also do so to any man whom I meet? (No),
<pb n="376"/>
for when I have heard, I keep silence, if I am of such a dis-
position; but he goes forth and tells all men what he has
heard. Then if I hear what has been done, if I be a man
like him, I resolve to be revenged, I divulge what he has
told me; I both disturb others and am disturbed myself.
But if I remember that one man does not injure another,
and that every man's acts injure and profit him, I secure
this, that I do not any thing like him, but still I suffer
what I do suffer through my own silly talk.</p>
<p>True: but it is unfair when you have heard the secrets
of your neighbour for you in your turn to communicate
nothing to him.&mdash;Did I ask you for your secrets, my man?
did you communicate your affairs on certain terms, that
you should in return hear mine also? If you are a babbler
and think that all who meet you are friends, do you wish
me also to be like you? But why, if you did well in
intrusting your affairs to me, and it is not well for me to
intrust mine to you, do you wish me to be so rash? It is
just the same as if I had a cask which is water-tight, and
you one with a hole in it, and you should come and
deposit with me your wine that I might put it into my
cask, and then should complain that I also did not intrust
my wine to you, for you have a cask with a hole in it.
How then is there any equality here? You intrusted
your affairs to a man who is faithful, and modest, to a
man who thinks that his own actions alone are injurious
and (or) useful, and that nothing external is. Would you
have me intrust mine to you, a man who has dishonoured
his own faculty of will, and who wishes to gain some
small bit of money or some office or promotion in the
court (emperor's palace), even if you should be going to
murder your own children, like Medea? Where (in what)
is this equality (fairness)? But show yourself to me to
be faithful, modest, and steady: show me that you have
friendly opinions; show that your cask has no hole in it;
and you will see how I shall not wait for you to trust me
with your affairs, but I myself shall come to you and ask
you to hear mine. For who does not choose to make use
of a good vessel? Who does not value a benevolent and
faithful adviser? who will not willingly receive a man
<pb n="377"/>
who is ready to bear a share, as we may say, of the diffi-
culty of his circumstances, and by this very act to ease the
burden, by taking a part of it.</p>
<p>True: but I trust you; you do not trust me.&mdash;In the
first place, not even do you trust me, but you are a
babbler, and for this reason you cannot hold any thing;
for indeed, if it is true that you trust me, trust your
affairs to me only; but now whenever you see a man at
leisure, you seat yourself by him and say: Brother, I
have no friend more benevolent than you nor dearer; I
request you to listen to my affairs. And you do this even
to those who are not known to you at all. But if you
really trust me, it is plain that you trust me because I am
faithful and modest, not because I have told my affairs to
you. Allow me then to have the same opinion about you.
Show me that if one man tells his affairs to another, he
who tells them is faithful and modest. For if this were
so, I would go about and tell my affairs to every man, if
that would make me faithful and modest. But the thing
is not so, and it requires no common opinions (principles).
If then you see a man who is busy about things not dependent on his will and subjecting his will to them, you
must know that this man has ten thousand persons to
compel and hinder him. He has no need of pitch or the
wheel to compel him to declare what he knows:<note anchored="yes">The wheel and pitch were instruments of torture to extract con-
fessions. See ii 6, 18, and Schweig.'s note there.</note> but a
little girl's nod, if it should so happen, will move him, the
blandishment of one who belongs to Caesar's court, desire
of a magistracy or of an inheritance, and things without
end of that sort. You must remember then among general
principles that secret discourses (discourses about secret
matters) require fidelity and corresponding opinions. But
where can we now find these easily? Or if you cannot
answer that question, let some one point out to me a man
who can say: I care only about the things which are my
own, the things which are not subject to hindrance, the
things which are by nature free. This I hold to be the
nature of the good: but let all other things be as they are
allowed; I do not concern myself.

<p>OF things some are in our power, and others are not.
In our power are opinion (<foreign lang="greek">u(po/lhyis</foreign>), movement towards a
thing (<foreign lang="greek">o(rmh/</foreign>), desire, aversion (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisis</foreign>, turning from a
thing); and in a word, whatever are our own acts: not
in our power are the body, property, reputation, offices
(magisterial power), and in a word, whatever are not our
own acts. And the things in our power are by nature
free, not subject to restraint nor hindrance: but the
things not in our power are weak, slavish, subject to
restraint, in the power of others. Remember then that if
you think the things which are by nature slavish to be
free, and the things which are in the power of others to
be your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you
will be disturbed, you will blame both gods and men:
but if you think that only which is your own to be your
own, and if you think that what is another's, as it really
is, belongs to another, no man will ever compel you, no
man will hinder you, you will never blame any man, you
will accuse no man, you will do nothing involuntarily
(against your will), no man will harm you, you will have
no enemy, for you will not suffer any harm.</p>
<p>If then you desire (aim at) such great things, remember
that you must not (attempt to) lay hold of them with a
small effort; but you must leave alone some things entirely, and postpone others for the present. But if you
wish for these things also (such great things), and power
<pb n="380"/>
(office) and wealth, perhaps you will not gain even these
very things (power and wealth) because you aim also at
those former things (such great things):<note anchored="yes">This passage will be obscure in the original, unless it is examined
well. I have followed the explanation of Simplicius, iv. (i. 4.)</note> certainly you
will fail in those things through which alone happiness
and freedom are secured. Straightway then practise saying to every harsh appearance,<note anchored="yes">Appearances are named 'harsh' or 'rough' when they are 'con-
trary to reason and overexciting and in fact make life rough (uneven)

and in no manner what you appear to be. Then examine
it by the rules which you possess, and by this first and
chiefly, whether it relates to the things which are in our
power or to things which are not in our power: and if it
relates to any thing which is not in our power, be ready to
say, that it does not concern you.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>Remember that desire contains in it the profession (hope)
of obtaining that which you desire; and the profession
(hope) in aversion (turning from a thing) is that you will
not fall into that which you attempt to avoid: and he
who fails in his desire is unfortunate; and he who falls
into that which he would avoid, is unhappy. If then you
attempt to avoid only the things contrary to nature which
are within your power, you will not be involved in any of
the things which you would avoid. But if you attempt
to avoid disease or death or poverty, you will be unhappy.
Take away then aversion from all things which are not in
our power, and transfer it to the things contrary to nature
which are in our power. But destroy desire completely
for the present. For if you desire anything which is not
in our power, you must be unfortunate: but of the things
in our power, and which it would be good to desire,
nothing yet is before you. But employ only the power of
moving towards an object and retiring from it; and these
powers indeed only slightly and with exceptions and with
remission.<note anchored="yes">See the notes in Schweig.'s edition.</note>

<div1 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>In every thing which pleases the soul, or supplies a
want, or is loved, remember to add this to the (description, notion); what is the nature of each thing, beginning
from the smallest? If you love an earthen vessel, say it is
an earthen vessel which you love; for when it has been
broken, you will not be disturbed. If you are kissing
your child or wife, say that it is a human being whom
you are kissing, for when the wife or child dies, you will
not be disturbed.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>When you are going to take in hand any act, remind
yourself what kind of an act it is. If you are going to
bathe, place before yourself what happens in the bath:
some splashing the water, others pushing against one
another, others abusing one another, and some stealing:
and thus with more safety you will undertake the matter,
if you say to yourself, I now intend to bathe, and to
maintain my will in a manner conformable to nature.
And so you will do in every act: for thus if any hindrance
to bathing shall happen, let this thought be ready: it was
not this only that I intended, but I intended also to
maintain my will in a way conformable to nature; but I
shall not maintain it so, if I am vexed at what happens.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but
by the opinions about the things: for example, death is
nothing terrible, for if it were, it would have seemed so
to Socrates; for the opinion about death, that it is
terrible, is the terrible thing. When then we are impeded
or disturbed or grieved, let us never blame others, but
ourselves, that is, our opinions. It is the act of an ill-
instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition;
it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay
the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is
completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.</p></div1>

<p>Be not elated at any advantage (excellence), which
belongs to another. If a horse when he is elated should

know that you are elated at having a good horse.<note anchored="yes">Upton proposes to read <foreign lang="greek">e)f' i(ppou= a)gafw=|</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ i(/ppw| a)gafw=|</foreign>.

then is your own? The use of appearances. Consequently
when in the use of appearances you are conformable to
nature, then be elated, for then you will be elated at
something good which is your own.</p></div1>

<p>As on a voyage when the vessel has reached a port,
if you go out to get water, it is an amusement by the

then you must throw away all those things, that you may
not be bound and pitched into the ship like sheep: so in
life also, if there be given to you instead of a little bulb
and a shell a wife and child, there will be nothing to
prevent (you from taking them). But if the captain
should call, run to the ship, and leave all those things
without regard to them. But if you are old, do not even
go far from the ship, lest when you are called you make

<p>If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as
these: if I neglect my affairs, I shall not have the means
of living: unless I chastise my slave, he will be bad. For
it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from
grief and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation;
and it is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be
unhappy.<note anchored="yes">He means, Do not chastise your slave while you are in a passion,
lest, while you are trying to correct him, and it is very doubtful
whether you will succeed, you fall into a vice which is a man's great
and only calamity. Schweig.</note> Begin then from little things. Is the oil
spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion,
at such price is sold freedom from perturbation; at such
price is sold tranquillity, but nothing is got for nothing.
And when you call your slave, consider that it is possible that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that
<pb n="384"/>
he will do nothing which you wish. But matters are not
so well with him, but altogether well with you, that it
should be in his power for you to be not disturbed.<note anchored="yes">The passage seems to mean, that your slave has not the power of
disturbing you, because you have the power of not being disturbed.
See Upton's note on the text.</note></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>If you would improve, submit to be considered without
sense and foolish with respect to externals. Wish to be
considered to know nothing: and if you shall seem to
some to be a person of importance, distrust yourself. For
you should know that it is not easy both to keep your
will in a condition conformable to nature and (to secure)
external things: but if a man is careful about the one, it
is an absolute necessity that he will neglect the other.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>If you would have your children and your wife and
your friends to live for ever, you are silly; for you would
have the things which are not in your power to be in
your power, and the things which belong to others to be
yours. So if you would have your slave to be free from
faults, you are a fool; for you would have badness not to
be badness, but something else.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">*te/lein</foreign> is used here, as it often is among the Stoics, to 'wish
absolutely,' 'to will.' When Epictetus says 'you would have badness
not to be badness,' he means that 'badness' is in the will of him who
has the badness, and as you wish to subject it to your will, you are a
fool. It is your business, as far as you can, to improve the slave: you
may wish this. It is his business to obey your instruction: this is
what he ought to wish to do; but for him to will to do this, that lies
in himself, not in you. Schweig.</note> But if you wish not to
fail in your desires, you are able to do that. Practise
then this which you are able to do. He is the master of
every man who has the power over the things, which
another person wishes or does not wish, the power to
confer them on him or to take them away. Whoever
then wishes to be free, let him neither wish for any thing
nor avoid anything which depends on others: if he does
not observe this rule, he must be a slave.

means (fault) of another any more than you can be
involved in any thing base. Is it then your business to
obtain the rank of a magistrate, or to be received at a
banquet? By no means. How then can this be want of
<pb n="388"/>
honor (dishonor)? And how will you be nobody nowhere,
when you ought to be somebody in those things only
which are in your power, in which indeed it is permitted
to you to be a man of the greatest worth? But your
friends will be without assistance! What do you mean
by being without assistance? They will not receive
money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens.
Who then told you that these are among the things which
are in our power, and not in the power of others? And
who can give to another what he has not himself? Acquire
money then, your friends say, that we also may have
something. If I can acquire money and also keep myself
modest, and faithful and magnanimous, point out the way,
and I will acquire it. But if you ask me to lose the
things which are good and my own, in order that you may
gain the things which are not good, see how unfair and
silly you are. Besides, which would you rather have,
money or a faithful and modest friend? For this end
then rather help me to be such a man, and do not ask me
to do this by which I shall lose that character. But my
country, you say, as far as it depends on me, will be
without my help. I ask again, what help do you mean?
It will not have porticoes or baths through you.<note anchored="yes">See the text.</note> And
what does this mean? For it is not furnished with shoes
by means of a smith, nor with arms by means of a shoemaker. But it is enough if every man fully discharges
the work that is his own: and if you provided it with
another citizen faithful and modest, would you not be
useful to it? Yes. Then you also cannot be useless to it.
What place then, you say, shall I hold in the city? Whatever you can, if you maintain at the same time your fidelity
and modesty. But if when you wish to be useful to the
state, you shall lose these qualities, what profit could you
be to it, if you were made shameless and faithless?</p></div1>

<p>Has any man been preferred before you at a banquet,
or in being saluted, or in being invited to a consultation?
If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he has
obtained them: but if bad, be not grieved because you
<pb n="389"/>
have not obtained them; and remember that you cannot,
if you do not the same things in order to obtain what is
not in our own power, be considered worthy of the same
(equal) things. For how can a man obtain an equal
share with another when he does not visit a man's doors
as that other man does, when he does not attend him
when he goes abroad, as the other man does; when he
does not praise (flatter) him as another does? You will
be unjust then and insatiable, if you do not part with
the price, in return for which those things are sold, and
if you wish to obtain them for nothing. Well, what is
the price of lettuces? An obolus<note anchored="yes">The sixth part of a drachma.</note> perhaps. If then a
man gives up the obolus, and receives the lettuces, and if
you do not give up the obolus and do not obtain the
lettuces, do not suppose that you receive less than he who
has got the lettuces; for as he has the lettuces, so you
have the obolus which you did not give. In the same
way then in the other matter also you have not been
invited to a man's feast, for you did not give to the host
the price at which the supper is sold; but he sells it for
praise (flattery), he sells it for personal attention. Give
then the price,<note anchored="yes">'Price' is here <foreign lang="greek">to\ diafe/ron</foreign>.</note> if it is for your interest, for which it is
sold. But if you wish both not to give the price and to
obtain the things, you are insatiable and silly. Have you
nothing then in place of the supper? You have indeed,
you have the not flattering of him, whom you did not

<p>As a mark is not set up for the purpose of missing the

or be done (happen) which in its proper sense, in itself and in its
nature is bad; for every thing is and is done by the wisdom and will
of God and for the purpose which he intended: but to miss a mark is
to fail in an intention; and as a man does not set up a mark, or does
not form a purpose for the purpose of missing the mark or the purpose,
so it is absurd (inconsistent) to say that God has a purpose or design,

<p>In every act observe the things which come first, and
those which follow it; and so proceed to the act. If you
do not, at first you will approach it with alacrity, without
having thought of the things which will follow; but
afterwards, when certain base (ugly) things have shewn
themselves, you will be ashamed. A man wishes to
conquer at the Olympic games. I also wish indeed, for it
<pb n="391"/>
is a fine thing. But observe both the things which come
first, and the things which follow; and then begin the
act. You must do every thing according to rule, eat
according to strict orders, abstain from delicacies, exercise
yourself as you are bid at appointed times, in heat, in cold,
you must not drink cold water, nor wine as you choose;
in a word, you must deliver yourself up to the exercise
master as you do to the physician, and then proceed to
the contest. And sometimes you will strain the hand,
put the ankle out of joint, swallow much dust, sometimes
be flogged, and after all this be defeated. When you
have considered all this, if you still choose, go to the contest: if you do not, you will behave like children, who at
one time play at wrestlers, another time as flute players,
again as gladiators, then as trumpeters, then as tragic
actors: so you also will be at one time an athlete, at
another a gladiator, then a rhetorician, then a philosopher,
but with your whole soul you will be nothing at all; but
like an ape you imitate every thing that you see, and one
thing after another pleases you. For you have not undertaken any thing with consideration, nor have you surveyed it well; but carelessly and with cold desire. Thus
some who have seen a philosopher and having heard one
speak, as Euphrates speaks,&mdash;and who can speak as he
does?&mdash;they wish to be philosophers themselves also. My
man, first of all consider what kind of thing it is: and
then examine your own nature, if you are able to sustain
the character. Do you wish to be a pentathlete or a
wrestler? Look at your arms, your thighs, examine your
loins. For different men are formed by nature for different
things. Do you think that if you do these things, you
can eat in the same manner, drink in the same manner,
and in the same manner loathe certain things? You must
pass sleepless nights, endure toil, go away from your
kinsmen, be despised by a slave, in every thing have the
inferior part, in honour, in office, in the courts of justice,
in every little matter. Consider these things, if you
would exchange for them, freedom from passions, liberty,
tranquillity. If not, take care that, like little children,
you be not now a philosopher, then a servant of the
publicani, then a rhetorician, then a procurator (manager)
for Caesar. These things are not consistent. You must
<pb n="392"/>
be one man, either good or bad. You must either cultivate your own ruling faculty, for external things; you
must either exercise your skill on internal things or on
external things; that is you must either maintain the
position of a philosopher or that of a common person.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="30">
<p>Duties are universally measured by relations (<foreign lang="greek">tai=s sxe/sesi</foreign>). Is a man a father? The precept is to take care
of him, to yield to him in all things, to submit when he is
reproachful, when he inflicts blows. But suppose that he
is a bad father. Were you then by nature made akin to
a good father? No; but to a father. Does a brother
wrong you? Maintain then your own position towards
him, and do not examine what he is doing, but what you
must do that your will shall be conformable to nature.
For another will not damage you, unless you choose: but
you will be damaged then when you shall think that you
are damaged. In this way then you will discover your
duty from the relation of a neighbour, from that of a
citizen, from that of a general, if you are accustomed
to contemplate the relations.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="31">
<p>As to piety towards the Gods you must know that this
is the chief thing, to have right opinions about them, to
think that they exist, and that they administer the All
well and justly; and you must fix yourself in this principle (duty), to obey them, and to yield to them in every
thing which happens, and voluntarily to follow it as
being accomplished by the wisest intelligence. For if
you do so, you will never either blame the Gods, nor will
you accuse them of neglecting you. And it is not possible
for this to be done in any other way than by withdrawing from the things which are not in our power, and by
placing the good and the evil only in those things which
are in our power. For if you think that any of the
things which are not in our power is good or bad, it is
absolutely necessary that, when you do not obtain what
you wish, and when you fall into those things which you
do not wish, you will find fault and hate those who are
<pb n="393"/>
the cause of them; for every animal is formed by nature
to this, to fly from, and to turn from the things which
appear harmful and the things which are the cause of the
harm, but to follow and admire the things which are useful and the causes of the useful. It is impossible then
for a person who thinks that he is harmed to be delighted
with that which he thinks to be the cause of the
harm, as it is also impossible to be pleased with the harm
itself. For this reason also a father is reviled by his son,
when he gives no part to his son of the things which are
considered to be good: and it was this which made
Polynices and Eteocles<note anchored="yes">See ii. 22, 13, iv. 5, 9.</note> enemies, the opinion that royal
power was a good. It is for this reason that the cultivator
of the earth reviles the Gods, for this reason the sailor
does, and the merchant, and for this reason those who
lose their wives and their children. For where the useful (your interest) is, there also piety is.<note anchored="yes">'It is plain enough that the philosopher does not say this, that
the reckoning of our private advantage ought to be the sole origin
and foundation of piety towards God.' Schweig., and he proceeds to
explain the sentence, which at first appears rather obscure Perhaps
Arrian intends to say that the feeling of piety coincides with the
opinion of the useful, the profitable; and that the man who takes care
to desire as he ought to do and to avoid as he ought to do, thus also
cares after piety, and so he will secure his interest (the profitable)
and he will not be discontented.

here (s. 31).</p></note> Consequently
he who takes care to desire as he ought and to avoid
(<foreign lang="greek">e)kkli/nein</foreign>) as he ought, at the same time also cares after
piety. But to make libations and to sacrifice and to offer
first fruits according to the custom of our fathers, purely
and not meanly nor carelessly nor scantily nor above our
ability, is a thing which belongs to all to do.</p></div1>

<p>When you have recourse to divination, remember that
you do not know how it will turn out, but that you are
come to inquire from the diviner. But of what kind it
is, you know when you come, if indeed you are a philo-
<pb n="394"/>
sopher. For if it is any of the things which are not in
our power, it is absolutely necessary that it must be
neither good nor bad. Do not then bring to the diviner
desire or aversion (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisin</foreign>): if you do, you will approach
him with fear. But having determined in your mind that
every thing which shall turn out (result) is indifferent,
and does not concern you, and whatever it may be, for it
will be in your power to use it well, and no man will
hinder this, come then with confidence to the Gods as
your advisers. And then when any advice shall have
been given, remember whom you have taken as advisers,
and whom you will have neglected, if you do not obey
them. And go to divination, as Socrates said that you
ought, about those matters in which all the inquiry has
reference to the result, and in which means are not given
either by reason nor by any other art for knowing the
thing which is the subject of the inquiry. Wherefore
when we ought to share a friend's danger or that of our
country, you must not consult the diviner whether you
ought to share it. For even if the diviner shall tell you
that the signs of the victims are unlucky, it is plain that
this is a token of death or mutilation of part of the body
or of exile. But reason prevails that even with these
risks we should share the dangers of our friend and of
our country. Therefore attend to the greater diviner, the
Pythian God, who ejected from the temple him who did
not assist his friend when he was being murdered.<note anchored="yes">The story is told by Aelian (iii. c. 44), and by Simplicius in his

improvement. For it is plain, if you do talk much that
you admired the spectacle (more than you ought).<note anchored="yes">To admire (<foreign lang="greek">fauma/zein</foreign>) is contrary to the precept of Epictetus; i. 29, ii. 6, iii. 20. Upton.</note></p>

<p>In company take care not to speak much and excessively about your own acts or dangers: for as it is pleasant to you to make mention of your own dangers, it is
not so pleasant to others to hear what has happened to
you. Take care also not to provoke laughter; for this
is a slippery way towards vulgar habits, and is also
adapted to diminish the respect of your neighbours. It is
a dangerous habit also to approach obscene talk. When
then any thing of this kind happens, if there is a good
opportunity, rebuke the man who has proceeded to this

<p>The condition and characteristic of an uninstructed person is this: he never expects from himself profit (advantage) nor harm, but from externals. The condition and
characteristic of a philosopher is this: he expects all advantage and all harm from himself. The signs (marks)
of one who is making progress are these: he censures no
man, he praises no man, he blames no man, he accuses no
man, he says nothing about himself as if he were somebody or knew something; when he is impeded at all or
hindered, he blames himself: if a man praises him, he
ridicules the praiser to himself: if a man censures him, he
makes no defence: he goes about like weak persons, being
careful not to move any of the things which are placed,
before they are firmly fixed: he removes all desire from
himself, and he transfers aversion (<foreign lang="greek">e)/kklisin</foreign>) to those things
only of the things within our power which are contrary to
nature: he employs a moderate movement towards every
thing: whether he is considered foolish or ignorant, he
cares not: and in a word he watches himself as if he were

<p>THESE Fragments are entitled <title lang="la">Epicteti Fragmenta maxime
ex Ioanne Stobaeo, Antonio, et Maximo collecta</title> (ed.
Schweig.). There are some notes and emendations on the
Fragments; and a short dissertation on them by Schweighaeuser.</p>
<p>Nothing is known of Stobaeus nor of his time, except
the fact that he has preserved some extracts of an ethical
kind from the New Platonist Hierocles, who lived about
the middle of the fifth century A. D.; and it is therefore concluded that Stobaeus lived after Hierocles. The
fragments attributed to Epictetus are preserved by Stobaeus in his work entitled <foreign lang="greek">'*anfolo/gion</foreign>, or Florilegium or
Sermones.</p>
<p>Antonius Monachus, a Greek monk, also made a Florilegium, entitled Melissa
(the bee). His date is uncertain, but it was certainly much later than the time of
Stobaeus.</p>
<p>Maximus, also named the monk, and reverenced as a
saint, is said to have been a native of Constantinople, and
born about A. D. <date value="580">580</date>.</p>
<p>Some of the Fragments contained in the edition of
Schweighaeuser are certainly not from Epictetus. Many
of the fragments are obscure; but they are translated as

give to them such meaning as he can.

<p>The body is here, and elsewhere in Epictetus, considered as an

so uses the body must be something which is capable of using the
body and a power which possesses what we name intelligence and
consciousness. Our bodies, as Bishop Butler says, are what we name
matter, and differ from other matter only in being more closely
connected with us than other matter. It would be easy to pass from
these notions to the notion that this intelligence and power, or to use
a common word. the soul, is something which exists independent of the
body, though we only know the soul while it acts within and on the
body, and by the body.</p></note>

to take care of our neighbour's body, we should not be
able to endure it. Consider then what a thing it would
be to rise in the morning and rub the teeth of another,

virtue. But the wealth of Themistocles and Themistocles

<p>Remember that such was, and is, and will be the nature
of the universe, and that it is not possible that the things
which come into being can come into being otherwise
than they do now; and that not only men have participated in this change and transmutation, and all other
living things which are on the earth, but also the things
<pb n="431"/>
which are divine. And indeed the very four elements are
changed and transmuted up and down, and earth becomes
water and water becomes air, and the air again is transmuted into other things, and the same manner of transmutation takes place from above to below. If a man
attempts to turn his mind towards these thoughts, and
to persuade himself to accept with willingness that which
is necessary, he will pass through life with complete
moderation and harmony.</p></div2>

<p>He who is dissatisfied with things present and what is

<div2 type="chapter" n="136">
<p>All things obey and serve the world (the universe),
earth and sea and sun and the rest of the stars, and the
plants of earth and animals. And our body obeys it also
both in disease and in health when it (the universe)
chooses, both in youth and in age, and when it is passing
through the other changes. What is reasonable then and
in our power is this, for our judgment not to be the only
thing which resists it (the universe): for it is strong and
superior, and it has determined better about us by administering (governing) us also together with the whole. And
besides, this opposition also is unreasonable and does
nothing more than cause us to be tormented uselessly and
to fall into pain and sorrow.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="169">
<p>Of the things which are, God has put some of them in
our power, and some he has not. In our own power he
has placed that which is the best and the most important,
that indeed through which he himself is happy, the use of
appearances (<foreign lang="greek">fantasiw=n</foreign>). For when this use is rightly
employed, there is freedom, happiness, tranquillity, constancy: and this is also justice and law, and temperance,
and every virtue. But all other things he has not placed
in our power. Wherefore we also ought to be of one mind
with God, and making this division of things, to look after
those which are in our power; and of the things not in
our power, to intrust them to the Universe (<foreign lang="greek">tw=| ko/smw|</foreign>), and
whether it should require our children, or our country, or

At Athens four measures (choenices) of meal are sold for
one obolus (the sixth of a drachme), and the fountains run
with water: if what I have is not enough (sufficient) for
me, yet I am sufficient for what I have, and so it becomes
sufficient for me. Do you not see that it was with no
nobler voice that Polus acted the part of Oedipus as king
than of Oedipus as a wanderer and beggar at Colonus?
Then shall the good man appear to be inferior to Polus,

know the nature of the good and the evil, and the measures (<foreign lang="greek">me/tra</foreign>) of the desires and the aversions (<foreign lang="greek">e)kkli/sewn</foreign>),
and also the movements towards things and from them;
and using these as rules to administer the affairs of life,
but not to trouble ourselves about the things above us?
For these things are perhaps incomprehensible to the
human mind: and if any man should even suppose them
to be in the highest degree comprehensible, what then is
the profit of them, if they are comprehended? And must
we not say that those men have needless trouble who
assign these things as necessary to the philosopher's discourse? Is then also the precept written at Delphi superfluous, which is Know thyself? It is not so, he says.
What then is the meaning of it? If a man gave to a
choreutes (member of chorus) the precept to know himself,

<head>THE THOUGHTS OF THE EMPEROR M.
AURELIUS ANTONINUS. Translated. Revised Edition,
Post 8vo., 3<hi rend="ital">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="ital">d</hi>.</head>
<p><quote>My quotations from Marcus Aurelius will be made (by permission)
from the forcible and admirably accurate translation of Mr. Long.
In thanking Mr. Long, I may be allowed to add that the English
reader will find in his version the best means of becoming acquainted
with the purest and noblest book of antiquity.</quote>&mdash;<hi rend="ital">The Rev. F. W. Farrar,</hi>
<hi rend="ital">M. A., in <quote>Seekers after God.</quote></hi></p>
<p><quote>Mr. Long's reputation as a scholar is a sufficient guarantee of the
general fidelity and accuracy of his translation. . . . But that for
which I and the rest of the unlearned may venture to praise Mr. Long is
this&mdash;that he treats Marcus Aurelius's writings as he treats all the other
remains of Greek and Roman antiquity which he touches, not as a dead
and dry matter of learning, but as documents with a side of modern
applicability and living interest, and valuable mainly so far as this side
in them can be made clear, that, as in his notes on 'Plutarch's Roman
Lives,' he deals with the modern epoch of C&aelig;sar and Cicero, not as food for
school-boys, but as food for men, and men engaged in the current of contemporary life and action; so in his remarks and essays on Marcus Aurelius he
treats this truly modern striver and thinker not as a classical dictionary
hero, but as a present source from which to draw 'example of life and
instruction of manners.' Why may not a son of Dr. Arnold say, what
might naturally be said by any other critic, that in this lively and fruitful
way of considering the men and affairs of ancient Greece and Rome
Mr. Long resembles Dr. Arnold. . . . . In general the substantiality,
soundness, and precision of his rendering are as conspicuous as the living
spirit with which he treats antiquity; and these qualities are particularly
desirable in the translator of a work like Marcus Aurelius's, of which the
language is often corrupt, almost always hard and <hi rend="ital">obscure.</hi></quote>&mdash;<hi rend="ital">Matthew</hi>

<p><quote>We feel quite sure that this book will become a favourite with all who
love genial wisdom conveyed in a happy and expressive style. Nor will it
be a favourite of a moment, but a friend and companion for years, to whom
the possessor will often have recourse for counsel as well as for entertain-
ment.</quote>&mdash;<hi rend="ital">Daily News.</hi></p>
<p><quote>This quaint and amusing work is well written.</quote>&mdash;Athen&aelig;um.</p>
<p><quote>The author is a shrewd, clever old gentleman, well informed, and one
who has certainly not spent his long life to disadvantage. The range of
subjects about which he thinks is very large, and what he does say is of
sterling quality.</quote>&mdash;<hi rend="ital">Court Journal.</hi></p>
<p><quote>In this book will be found some excellent writing, many just thoughts,
and a dash of racy originality, too rare to be undervalued.</quote>&mdash;<hi rend="ital">Westminster</hi>
<hi rend="ital">Review.</hi></p>
<p><quote>It is not without regret that we are compelled to acknowledge that
the Old Man must be regarded as belonging to the school of gossiping
geniality of which 'A. K. H. B.' is the most characteristic and best known
representative. He is, however, in every respect, very superior to the

<p>THE DECLINE OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.</p>
<p>In 5 vols., 8vo., 148. each.</p>
<p>Vol. I. From the Destruction of Carthage to the End of the
Jugurthine War.</p>
<p>Vol. II. To the Death of Sertorius.</p>
<p>Vol. III. Including the Third Mithridatic War, the Catiline
Conspiracy, and the Consulship of C. Julius C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>Vol. IV. History of C&aelig;sar's Gallic Campaigns and of the
Contemporaneous Events in Rome.</p>
<p>Vol. V. (<hi rend="ital">Concluding the Work.</hi>) From C&aelig;sar's Invasion of
Italy to his Death.</p>
<p><quote>If any one can guide us through the almost inextricable mazes of this
labyrinth, it is Mr. Long. As a chronicler he possesses all the requisite
knowledge, and what is nearly, if not quite as important, the necessary
caution. He never attempts to explain that which is hopelessly corrupt or
obscure; he does not confound twilight with daylight; he warns the reader
repeatedly that he is standing on shaking ground; he has no framework o!
theory into which he presses his facts.</quote>&mdash;<hi rend="ital">Saturday Review.</hi></p>
<p><quote>Of the general tone of the book we can speak with high praise.
Mr. Long is free from that admiration of 'blood and iron,' which mars
Dr. Mommsen's brilliant volumes. He can admire C&aelig;sar's greatness, and
yet, as we have seen, he is not blind to the enormous amount of human
suffering which his wars caused; he points out Cicero's weaknesses, but
he does not treat him as a contemptible fool; he is alive to Cato's shortcomings, but he does not think him a criminal because he resisted C&aelig;sar's
attempt to make himself sole master of the Roman world. On the whole,
then, we think highly of his work. It might, to cur thinking, have
been still more valuable than it is; that it is not, is owing, not to any
want of ability in the author, but to his own choice. He had his own
idea of the mode in which it ought to be written, and in that mode it is
ably and faithfully executed. We feel sorry at parting with a scholar
who has, in the course of a long life, done much for classical learning,
who has always worked honestly and honourably, and whose labours have
been so indifferently rewarded.</quote>&mdash;&mdash;<hi rend="ital">Athen&aelig;um.</hi>
