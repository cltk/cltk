<head>The Discourses of Epictetus</head>
<div1 type="book" n="0">

<head>Arrian to Lucius Gellius</head>
<opener><salute>Wisheth all happiness.</salute></opener>
<p>I neither composed the Discourses of
Epictetus in the sense in which things of
this nature can properly be said to have been
composed, nor did I myself produce them to
public view, any more than I composed them.
But whatever I heard from his own mouth, that
I tried to set down in the very same words, so
far as possible, and to preserve as memorials
for my own use, of his manner of thinking, and
his frank utterance.</p>
<p>These Discourses are such as one person
would naturally deliver from his own thoughts,
<foreign lang="la">ex tempore,</foreign> to another; not such as he would
prepare to be read by others afterwards. Such
as they are, I cannot tell how, without either my
consent or knowledge, they have fallen into the
hands of the public. But it is of little consequence to me if I do not appear an able writer,
and of none to Epictetus if any one treats his
<pb id="p.1002"/>
Discourses with contempt; since it was very
evident, even when he uttered them, that he
aimed at nothing more than to move the minds
of his hearers toward virtue. If they produce
that one effect, they have in them what, I think,
philosophical discourses ought to have. And
should they fail of it, let the readers however
be assured, that when Epictetus himself pronounced them, his audience could not help
being affected in the very manner he intended
they should. If by themselves his Discourses
have less efficacy, perhaps it is my fault, or
perhaps it is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Farewell.

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>Of the things which are, and the things which are not in our own power.</head>
<p>Of human faculties in general, you will find that
each is unable to contemplate itself, and therefore to approve or disapprove itself. How far does
the proper sphere of grammar extend? As far as the
judging of language. Of music? As far as the judging of melody. Does either of them contemplate itself, then? By no means.</p>
<p>Thus, for instance, when you are to write to your
friend, grammar will tell you what to write; but
whether you are to write to your friend at all, or no,
grammar will not tell you. Thus music, with regard
to tunes; but whether it be proper or improper, at
any particular time, to sing or play, music will not tell
you.
<pb id="p.1004"/>
What will tell, then?</p>
<p>That faculty which contemplates both itself and all
other things.</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>The Reasoning Faculty; for that alone is found
able to place an estimate upon itself, - what it is,
what are its powers, what its value and likewise all the
rest.  For what is it else that says, gold is beautiful?
since the gold itself does not speak.  Evidently, that
faculty which judges of the appearances of things.<note anchored="yes">The word (<foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>) here translated " the appearances of
things," will sometime- be found rendered, in other passages,
"the phenomena of existence," and sometimes " things as they
appear." It was a favorite word with the Stoics, and can be
adequately translated by no single English word, or even
phrase, - implying as it does not merely the uncertainty of all
impressions, but the unimportance of the emotions they involved. Fortunately for translators, Epictetus cared very little
for metaphysical subtilties, and very much for his few and
simple ethical principles; so that it is rarely difficult to make
his meaning clear. - H.</note>
What else distinguishes music, grammar, the other
faculties, proves their uses, and shows their proper
occasions?</p>
<p>Nothing but this.</p>
<p>As it was fit, then, this most excellent and superior
faculty alone, a right use of the appearances of things,
the gods have placed in our own power; but all other
matters they have not placed in our power.  What,
was it because they would not?  I rather think that,
if they could, they had granted us these too; but they
<pb id="p.1005"/>
certainly could not. For, placed upon earth, and
confined to such a body and to such companions,
how was it possible that, in these respects, we should
not be hindered by things outside of us?</p>
<p>But what says Zeus? " O Epictetus, if it had been
possible, I had made this little body and property of
thine free, and not liable to hindrance. But now do
not mistake; it is not thy own, but only a finer mixture of clay. Since, then, I could not give thee this,
I have given thee a certain portion of myself; this
faculty of exerting the powers of pursuit and avoidance, of desire and aversion, and, in a word, the use
of the appearances of things. Taking care of this
point, and making what is thy own to consist in this,
thou wilt never be restrained, never be hindered; thou
wilt not groan, wilt not complain, wilt not flatter any
one.  How, then? Do all these advantages seem
small to thee?  Heaven forbid! Let them  suffice
thee, then, and thank the gods."</p>
<p>But now, when it is in our power to take care of
one thing, and to apply ourselves to one, we choose
rather to take care of many, and to encumber ourselves with many, - body, property, brother, friend,
child, and slave, - and, by this multiplicity of encumbrances, we are burdened and weighed down. Thus,
when the weather does not happen to be fair for sailing, we sit in distress and gaze out perpetually. Which
way is the wind? North. What good will that do
us? When will the west blow? When it pleases
<pb id="p.1006"/>
friend, or when Aeolus pleases; for Zeus has not made
you dispenser of the winds, but Aeolus.</p>
<p>What, then, is to be done?</p>
<p>To make the best of what is in our power, and take
the rest as it occurs.</p>
<p>And how does it occur?</p>
<p>As it pleases God.</p>
<p>What, then, must I be the only one to lose my head?</p>
<p>Why, would you have all the world, then, lose their
heads for your consolation? Why are not you willing
to stretch out your neck, like Lateranus,<note anchored="yes">Plautius Lateranus, a consul elect, was put to death by the
command of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, for being privy to the conspiracy of Piso.
His execution was so sudden that he was not permitted to take
leave of his wife and children, but was hurried into a place appropriated to the punishment of slaves, and there killed by the
hand of the tribune Statius. He suffered in obstinate silence,
and without making any reproach to Statius, who was concerned in the same plot for which he himself was punished.
<bibl n="Tac. Ann. 15.16">Tacitus, Ann. 15.60</bibl>.- C.</note> when he
was commanded  by Nero to be beheaded? For,
shrinking a little -after receiving a weak blow, he
stretched it out again. And before this, when Epaphroditus,<note anchored="yes">Epaphroditus was the master of requests and freedman of
Nero, and the master of Epictetus. He assisted Nero in killing
himself, for which he was condemned to death by Domitian
<p><bibl n="Suet. Nero 49">Suetonius in Vita Neronis, 49</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet. Dom. 14">Domit. c. 14</bibl>.-C.</p></note> the freedman of Nero, interrogated him
about the conspiracy, " If I have a mind to say anything," replied he, " I will tell it to your master."</p>
<p>What resource have we, then, upon such occasions?
Why, what else but to distinguish between what is
<pb id="p.1007"/>
<emph>ours</emph>, and what not <emph>ours</emph>, - what is right, and what is
wrong? I must die, and must I die groaning too?
I must be fettered; must I be lamenting too? I
must be exiled; and what hinders me, then, but that
I may go smiling, and cheerful, and serene?  "Betray a secret." I will not betray it, for this is in my
own power. "Then I will fetter you."  What do
you say, man?   Fetter me? You will fetter my leg,
but not Zeus himself can get the better of my free
will.  " I will throw you into prison; I will behead
that paltry body of yours." Did I ever tell you
that I alone had a head not liable to be cut off?
These   things ought philosophers to study; these
ought they daily to write, and in these to exercise
themselves.</p>
<p>Thraseas<note anchored="yes">Thraseas Pastus, a Stoic philosopher put to death by Nero.
Hie was husband of Arria, so well known by that beautiful epigram in Martial. The expression of Tacitus concerning him
is remarkable: <cit><quote>After the murder of so many excellent persons,
Nero at last formed a desire of cutting off virtue itself, by the
execution of Thraseas Paetus and Bareas Soranus.</quote> <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 16.21">Ann. 16.21.</bibl></cit>- C.</note> used to say, " I had rather be killed today than banished to-morrow." But how did <placeName key="tgn,2633122">Rufus</placeName><note anchored="yes">Rufus was a <placeName key="tgn,2072785">Tuscan</placeName>, of the equestrian order, and a Stoic philosopher. When Vespasian banished the other philosophers, <placeName key="tgn,2633121">Rufus</placeName> was alone excepted. - C.</note>
answer him?  " If you prefer it as a heavier misfortune, how foolish a preference ! If as a lighter, who
has put it in your power?  Why do you not study to
be contented with what is allotted you?"
<pb id="p.1008"/></p>
<p>Well, and what said Agrippinus <note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>Agrippinus was banished by <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, for no other crime than
the unfortunate death of his father, who had been causelessly
killed by the command of Tiberius; and this had furnished a
pretence for accusing him of hereditary disloyalty.</quote> <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 10.28">Tacitus,
Ann. 10.1 c. 28, 29. - C.</bibl></cit></note> upon this account?
"I will not be a hindrance to myself."   Word was
brought him, " Your cause is pending in the senate."
"Good luck attend it; but it is eleven o'clock " (the
hour when he used to exercise before bathing),- " let
us go to our exercise."  This being over, a messenger
tells him, " You are condemned."  " To banishment,"
says he, " or to death?  " " To banishment." "What of
my estate? " " It is not taken away."  Well, then, let
us go as far as Aricia,<note anchored="yes">Aricia, a town about sixteen miles from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the first stage in his road to banishment. - C.</note> and dine there."</p>
<p>This it is to have studied what ought to be studied;
to have placed our desires and aversions above tyranny
and above chance. I must die, -if instantly, I will die
instantly; if in a short time, I will dine first, and when
the hour comes, then will I die.  How?  As becomes
one who restores what is not his own.
<pb id="p.1009"/></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<head>In what manner, upon every occasion, to preserve our character.</head>
<p>To   a reasonable creature, that alone is insupportable which is unreasonable, but everything reasonable may be supported. Stripes are not in
themselves insupportable. " How so? " See how the
Spartans<note anchored="yes">The Spartans, to make a trial of the fortitude of their children, used to have them publicly whipped at the altar of Artemis; and often with so much severity that they expired. The boys supported this exercise with so much constancy as never to cry out, nor even groan. - C.</note> bear whipping, after they have learned that
it is a reasonable thing. Hanging is not insupportable; for, as soon as a man has taken it into his head
that it is reasonable, he goes and hangs himself. In
short, we shall find by observation that no creature is
oppressed so much by anything as by what is unreasonable; nor on the other hand, attracted to anything
so strongly, as to what is reasonable.</p>
<p>But it happens that different things are reasonable
and unreasonable, as well as good and bad, advantageous and disadvantageous, to different persons. On
this account, chiefly, we stand in need of a liberal
education, to teach us to adapt the preconceptions of
reasonable and unreasonable to particular cases, con-
<pb id="p.1010"/>
formably to nature. But to judge of reasonable and
unreasonable, we make use not only of a due estimation of things without us, but of what relates to each
person's particular character. Thus, it is reasonable
for one man to submit to a menial office, who considers this only, that if he does not submit to it he
shall be whipt and lose his dinner, but that if he does,
he has nothing hard or disagreeable to suffer; whereas to another it appears insupportable, not only to
submit to such an office himself, but to respect any
one else who does. If you ask me, then, whether you
shall do this menial office or not, I will tell you it is a
pleasanter thing to get a dinner than not, and a
greater disgrace to be whipt than not to be whipt; so
that, if you measure yourself by these things, go and
do your office.</p>
<p>" Ay, but this is not suitable to my character."</p>
<p>It is you who are to consider that, not I; for it is
you who know yourself, what value you set upon yourself, and at what rate you sell yourself; for different
people sell themselves at different prices.</p>
<p>Hence Agrippinus,<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote><placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> was remarkably fond of theatrical entertainments,
and used to introduce upon the stage the descendants of noble
families, whom want had rendered venal.</quote> <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 14.14">Tacitus, Ann. 14.
c. 14.</bibl></cit>- C.</note>  when Florus was deliberating
whether he should go to Nero's shows, and perform
some part in them himself, bid him go. "But why
do not you go, then? " says Florus. " Because," re-
<pb id="p.1011"/>
plied Agrippinus, " I do not deliberate about it." For
he who once sets himself about such considerations,
and goes to calculating the worth of external things,
approaches very near to those who forget their own
character. Why, then, do you ask me whether death
or life be the more eligible?  I answer, life. Pain or
pleasure?  I answer, pleasure.  " But if I do not act
a part, I shall lose my head."  Go and act it, then,
but I will not.   "Why?" Because you esteem
yourself only as one thread of many that make up the
piece.  "What then?"  You have nothing to care
for, but how to be like the rest of mankind, as one
thread desires not to be distinguished from the others.
But I would be the purple,<note anchored="yes">An allusion to the purple border which distinguished the dress of the Roman nobility. - C.</note> that small and brilliant
part, which gives a lustre and beauty to the rest. Why,
then, do you bid me resemble the multitude? At that
rate, how shall I be the purple?</p>
<p>This Priscus Helvidius,<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote>Helvidius Priscus was no less remarkable for his learning
and philosophy than for the sanctity of his manners and the
love of his country. He behaved, however, with too much
haughtiness on several occasions, to Vespasian, who sentenced
him to death with great reluctance, and even forbade the execution when it was too late.</quote> <bibl n="Suet. Ves. 15">Sueton. in Vesp. 15.</bibl></cit>-C.</note> too, saw, and acted accordingly; for when Vespasian had sent to forbid his going to the Senate, he answered, " It is in your power
to prevent my continuing a senator; but while I am
one I must go." - "Well, then, at least be silent
<pb id="p.1012"/>
there."  "Do not ask my opinion and I will be
silent." -" But I must ask it."  " And I must speak
what appears to me to be right." - "But if you do,
I will put you to death."  <emph>"When</emph> did I ever tell
you that I was immortal? You will do your part, and
I mine; it is yours to kill, and mine to die intrepid;
fours to banish, mine to depart untroubled."</p>
<p>What good, then, did Priscus do, who was but a
single person?, Why, what good does the purple do
to the garment? What, but to be beautiful in itself,
and to set a good example to the rest? Another,
perhaps, if in such circumstances Caesar had forbidden
his going to the Senate, would have answered, " I am
obliged to you for excusing me." But such a one he
would not have forbidden to go, - well knowing that
he would either sit like a statue, or, if he spoke, would
say what he knew to be agreeable to Caesar, and would
overdo it by adding still more.</p>
<p>Thus acted even a wrestler, who was in danger of
death, unless he consented to an ignominious amputation. His brother, who was a philosopher, coming
to him, and saying " Well, brother, what do you design
to do? Let us cut away this part, and return again
to the field." He refused, and courageously died.</p>
<p>When it was asked whether he acted thus as a
wrestler, or a philosopher, I answer, as a man, said
Epictetus; but as a man who had been proclaimed a
champion at the Olympic games; who had been used
to such places, and not exercised merely in the school
<pb id="p.1013"/>
of Bato.<note anchored="yes">Bato was a famous master of the Olympic exercises. - C.</note> Another would have had his very head cut
off, if he could have lived without it. This is that
regard to character, so powerful with those who are
accustomed to introduce it, from their own breasts,
into their deliberations.</p>
<p>"Come now, Epictetus, take off your beard."<note anchored="yes">Domitian ordered all the philosophers to be banished. To avoid this inconvenience, those who had a mind to disguise their profession, took off their beards. -C.</note>  If
I am a philosopher, I answer, I will not take it off. -
"Then I will take off your head."  If that will do
you any good, take it.</p>
<p>It was asked, How shall each of us perceive what
belongs to his character? Whence, replied Epictetus,
does a bull, when the lion approaches, alone recognize
his own qualifications, and expose himself alone for
the whole herd? It is evident that with the qualifications occurs, at the same time, the consciousness of
being indued with them. And in the same manner,
whoever of us hath such qualifications will not be ignorant of them. But neither is a bull nor a gallant-spirited man formed all at once. We are to exercise,
and qualify ourselves, and not to run rashly upon
what doth not concern us.</p>
<p>Only consider at what price you sell your own free
will, O man ! - if only that you may not sell it for a
trifle. The highest greatness and excellence perhaps
seem to belong to others, to such as <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>. Why,
<pb id="p.1014"/>
then, as we are born with a like nature, do not all, or
the greater number, become such as he? Why, are
all horses swift?  Are all dogs sagacious? What,
then, because my gifts are humble shall I neglect all
care of myself? Heaven forbid ! Epictetus may not
surpass <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, - granted; but could I overtake him
it might be enough for me. I shall never be <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName>,
and yet I do not neglect my body; nor Croesus, and
yet I do not neglect my property; nor should we
omit any effort from a despair of arriving at the
highest.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<head>How, from the doctrine that god is the father of mankind, we may proceed to its consequences.</head>
<p>If a person could be persuaded of this principle as
he ought, that we are all originally descended
from God, and that he is the father of men and gods,
I conceive he never would think of himself meanly or
ignobly. Suppose Caesar were to adopt you, there
would be no bearing your haughty looks; and will
you not feel ennobled on knowing yourself to be the
son of God? Yet, in fact, we are not ennobled. But
having two things united in our composition, a body
in common with the brutes, and reason in common
with the gods, many incline to this unhappy and mortal kindred, and only some few to that which is happy
<pb id="p.1015"/>
and divine. And, as of necessity every one must treat
each particular thing according to the notions he
forms about it, so those few who suppose that they
are made for faith and honor and a wise use of things
will never think meanly or ignobly concerning themselves. But with the multitude the case is contrary.
"For what am I? A poor contemptible man, with
this miserable flesh of mine?"  Miserable indeed;
but you have likewise something better than this poor
flesh. Why, then, overlooking that, do you pine away
in attention to this?</p>
<p>By means of this [animal] kindred some of us, deviating towards it, become like wolves, faithless, and
crafty, and mischievous; others, like lions, wild and
savage and untamed; but most of us foxes, and disgraceful even among brutes. For what else is a slanderous and ill-natured man but a fox, or something
yet more wretched and mean? Watch and take heed,
then, that you do not sink thus low.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Of progress.</head>
<p>He who is entering on a state of progress, having learned from the philosophers that good
should be sought and evil shunned, and having learned,
too, that prosperity and peace are no otherwise at-
<pb id="p.1016"/>
tainable by man than in not missing what he seeks,
nor incurring what he shuns, - such a one totally extirpates and banishes all wayward desire, and shuns
only those things over which he can have control.
For if he should attempt to shun those things over
which he has no control, he knows that he must
sometimes incur that which he shuns, and be unhappy. Now if virtue promises happiness, prosperity,
and peace, then progress in virtue is certainly progress in each of these. For to whatever point the
perfection of anything absolutely brings us, progress
is always an approach towards it.</p>
<p>How happens it, then, that when we confess virtue
to be such, yet we seek, and make an ostentatious
show of progress in other things ! What is the business of virtue?</p>
<p>A life truly prosperous.</p>
<p>Who is in a state of progress, then? He who has
best studied Chrysippus?<note anchored="yes">Chrysippus was regarded as the highest authority among the later Stoics; but not one of his seven hundred volumes bas come down to posterity. - H.</note> Why, does virtue consist
in having read Chrysippus through? If so, progress
is confessedly nothing else than understanding a great
deal of Chrysippus; otherwise we confess virtue to
consist in one thing, and declare progress, which is
an approach to it, to be quite another thing.</p>
<p>This person, they say, is already able to understand
Chrysippus, by himself. "Certainly, sir, you have
<pb id="p.1017"/>
made a vast improvement!"   What improvement?
Why do you delude him? Why do you withdraw
him from a sense of his real needs? Why do not you
show him the real function of virtue, that he may
know where to seek progress? Seek it there, O unfortunate, where your work lies. And where does
your work lie? In learning what to seek and what
to shun, that you may neither be disappointed of the
one nor incur the other; in practising how to pursue
and how to avoid, that you may not be liable to fail;
in practising intellectual assent and doubt, that you
may not be liable to be deceived. These are the first
and most necessary things. But if you merely seek, in
trembling and lamentation, to keep away all possible
ills, what real progress have you made?</p>
<p>Show me then your progress in this point. As if I
should say to a wrestler, Show me your muscle; and
he should answer me, " See my dumb-bells."  Your
dumb-bells are your own affair; I desire to see the
effect of them.</p>
<p>"Take the treatise on the active powers, and see
how thoroughly I have perused it."</p>
<p>I do not inquire into this, O slavish man, but how
you exert those powers, how you manage your desires and aversions, your intentions and purposes, how
you meet events, -whether in accordance with nature's laws or contrary to them. If in accordance,
give me evidence of that, and I will say you improve;
if the contrary, you may go your way, and not only
<pb id="p.1018"/>
comment on these treatises, but write such yourself;
and yet what service will it do you? Do not you
know that the whole volume is sold for five denarii?
Does he who comments upon it, then, value himself
at more than that sum?  Never make your life to lie
in one thing and yet seek progress in another.</p>
<p>Where is progress, then?</p>
<p>If any of you, withdrawing himself from externals,
turns to his own will, to train, and perfect, and render
it conformable to nature, - noble, free, unrestrained,
unhindered, faithful, humble ; - if he has learned, too,
that whoever desires or shuns things beyond his own
power can neither be faithful nor free, but must necessarily take his chance with them, must necessarily
too be subject to others, to such as can procure or
prevent what he desires or shuns; if, rising in the
morning, he observes and keeps to these rules; bathes
regularly, eats frugally, and to every subject of action
applies the same fixed principles,-if a racer to racing, if an orator to oratory,-this is he who truly
makes progress; this is he who has not labored in
vain. But if he is wholly intent on reading books,
and has labored that point only, and travelled for
that, I bid him go home immediately and do his
daily duties; since that which he sought is nothing.</p>
<p>The only real thing is to study how to rid life of
lamentation, and complaint, and <emph>Alas</emph> ! and <emph>I am undone</emph>, and misfortune, and failure; and to learn what
death, what exile, what a prison, what poison is; that
<pb id="p.1019"/>
he may be able to say in a prison, like <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, "My
dear Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be; "
and not, "Wretched old man, have I kept my gray
hairs for this!"  [Do you ask] who speaks thus?
Do you think I quote some mean and despicable person? Is it not Priam who says it? Is it not Oedipus?
Nay, how many kings say it? For what else is
tragedy but the dramatized sufferings of men, bewildered by an admiration of externals?  If one were to
be taught by fictions that things beyond our will are
nothing to us, I should rejoice in such a fiction, by
which I might live prosperous and serene. But what
your own aims are, it is your business to consider.</p>
<p>Of what service, then, is Chrysippus to us?</p>
<p>To teach you that those things are not false on
which true prosperity and peace depend. "Take my
books, and you will see how true and conformable to
nature those things are which give me peace." How
great a happiness ! And how great the benefactor
who shows the way! To Triptolemus<note anchored="yes">Triptolemus was said to have introduced agriculture and vegetable food among men, under the guidance of Demeter. - H.</note> all men have
raised temples and altars, because he gave us a milder
kind of food ; but to him who has discovered and
brought to light and communicated the truth to all, -
the means, not merely of living, but of living well, -
who among you ever raised an altar or a temple, or
dedicated a statue; or who worships God in his name?
<pb id="p.1020"/>
We offer sacrifices in memory of those who have given
us corn and the vine; and shall we not give thanks
to God for those who have nurtured such fruit in
the human breast, - even the truth which makes us
blessed?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Concerning the academics.<note anchored="yes">The New Academy denied the existence of any universal truths. - H.</note></head>
<p>It is said that there are those who will oppose very
evident truths, and yet it is not easy to find a reason which may persuade such an one to alter his opinion. This may arise neither from his own strength
nor from the weakness of his teacher; but when a man
becomes obstinate in error, reason cannot always reach
him.</p>
<p>Now there are two sorts of obstinacy: the one, of
the intellect; the other, of the will. A man may obstinately set himself not to assent to evident truths,
nor to quit the defence of contradictions. We all
dread a bodily paralysis, and would make use of
every contrivance to avoid it; but none of us is
troubled about a paralysis of the soul. And yet, indeed, even with regard to the soul, when a person is so
affected as not to apprehend or understand anything,
we think him in a sad condition; but where the emo-
<pb id="p.1021"/>
tions of shame and modesty are under an absolute
paralysis, we go so far as even to call this strength of
mind!</p>
<p>Are you certain that you are awake? "I am
not," replies such a person, " for neither am I certain
when in dreaming I appear to myself to be awake."
Is there no difference, then, between these appearances? "None." Shall I argue with this man any
longer? For what steel or what caustic can I apply,
to make him sensible of his paralysis? If he is sensible of it, and pretends not to be so, he is even worse
than dead. He sees not his inconsistency, or, seeing
it, holds to the wrong. He moves not, makes no
progress; he rather falls back. His sense of shame
is gone; his reasoning faculty is not gone, but brutalized. Shall I call <emph>this</emph> strength of mind?  By no
means, - unless we allow it to be such in the vilest
debauchees publicly to speak and act out their worse
impulses.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Of providence.</head>
<p>For every event that happens in the world it is
easy to give thanks to Providence, if a person
has but these two qualities in himself: a habit of
closely considering what happens to each individual,
<pb id="p.1022"/>
and a grateful temper. Without the first, he will not
perceive the usefulness of things which happen; and
without the other, he will not be thankful for them.
If God had made colors, and had not made the faculty of seeing them, what would have been their use?
None. On the other hand, if he had made the faculty
of observation, without objects to observe, what would
have been the use of that? None. Again, if he
had formed both the faculty and the objects, but had
not made the light of day? Neither in that case
would they have been of any use.</p>
<p>Who is it, then, that has fitted each of these to the
other? Who is it that has fitted the sword to the
scabbard, and the scabbard to the sword? Is there
no such Being? From the very construction of a
complete work, we are used to declare positively that
it must be the operation of some artificer, and not the
effect of mere chance. Does every such work, then,
demonstrate an artificer, and do not visible objects,
and the sense of seeing, and light, demonstrate one?
Do not the difference of the sexes, and their inclination
to each other, and the use of their several powers, -
do not these things demonstrate an artificer?  Most
certainly they do.</p>
<p>But further; this constitution of understanding, by
which we are not simply impressed by sensible objects, but take and subtract and add and combine, and
pass from point to point by inference, - is not all this
sufficient to prevail on some men, and make them
<pb id="p.1023"/>
ashamed of leaving an artificer out of their scheme?
If not, let them explain to us what the power is that
effects each of these, and how it is possible that
chance should produce things so wonderful, and which
carry such marks of design.</p>
<p>What, then, do these things belong to us alone?</p>
<p>Many, indeed, - such as are peculiarly necessary for
a reasonable creature; but you will find many which
are common to us with mere animals.</p>
<p>Then, do they too understand what happens?</p>
<p>Not at all; for use is one affair, and understanding
another. But God had need of animals to make use
of things, and of us to understand that use. It is
sufficient, therefore, for them to eat, and drink, and
sleep, and continue their species, and perform other
such offices as belong to each of them; but to us, to
whom He has given likewise a faculty of understanding, these offices are not sufficient. For if we do not
proceed in a wise and systematic manner, and suitably
to the nature and constitution of each thing, we shall
never attain our end. For where the constitution of
beings is different, their offices and ends are different
likewise. Thus where the constitution is adapted only
to use, there use is alone sufficient; but where understanding is added to use, unless that too be duly exercised the end of such a being will never be attained.</p>
<p>Well, then, each of the animals is constituted
either for food, or husbandry, to produce milk, or for
some other like use; and for these purposes what
<pb id="p.1024"/>
need is there of understanding things, and being able
to discriminate concerning them?  But God has introduced man, as a spectator of Himself and of his
works; and not only as a spectator, but an interpreter of them. It is therefore shameful that man
should begin and end where irrational creatures do.
He is indeed to begin there, but to end where nature
itself has fixed our end; and that is, in contemplation
and understanding, and in a scheme of life conformable to nature.</p>
<p>Take care, then, not to die without the contemplation of these things. You take a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>
to behold the work of Phidias, and each of you thinks
it a misfortune to die without a knowledge of such
things; and will you have no inclination to see and
understand those works for which there is no need to
take a journey, but which are ready and at hand
even to those who bestow no pains! Will you never
perceive what you are, or for what you were born, or
for what purpose you are admitted to behold this
spectacle?</p>
<p>"But there are in life some things unpleasant and
difficult."</p>
<p>And are there none at <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>? Are you not
heated? Are you not crowded?  Are you not without good conveniences for bathing? Are you not wet
through when it happens to rain? Do you not have
uproar, and noise, and other disagreeable circumstances? But, I suppose, by comparing all these with
<pb id="p.1025"/>
the merit of the spectacle, you support and endure
them. Well, and have you not received faculties by
which you may support every event [of life]?  Have
you not received greatness of soul? Have you not
received a manly spirit? Have you not received patience? What signifies to me anything that happens,
while my soul is above it? What shall disconcert or
trouble or appear grievous to me? Shall I neglect to
use my powers to that purpose for which I received
them; and shall I lament and groan at every casualty?</p>
<p>"True, no doubt; but I have such a disagreeable
catarrh !"  Attend to your diseases, then, as best you
can. Do you say it is unreasonable that there should
be such a discomfort in the world?</p>
<p>And how much better is it that you should have a
catarrh than complain? Pray, what figure do you
think <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> would have made if there had not
been a lion, and a hydra, and a stag, and unjust and
brutal men, whom he expelled and cleared away?
And what would he have done if none of these had
existed? Is it not plain that he must have wrapped
himself up and slept? In the first place, then, he
would never have become a <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> by slumbering
away his whole life in such delicacy and ease; or if
he had, what good would it have done? What would
have been the use of his arm and his strength, of
his patience and greatness of mind, if such circumstances and subjects of action had not roused and
exercised him?
<pb id="p.1026"/></p>
<p>What, then, must we provide these things for ourselves; and introduce a boar and a lion and a hydra
into our country?</p>
<p>This would be madness and folly. But as they
were in being, and to be met with, they were proper
subjects to call out and exercise <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName>. Do you
therefore likewise, being sensible of this, consider the
faculties you have, and after taking a view of them
say, "Bring on me now, O Zeus, what difficulty thou
wilt, for I have faculties granted me by thee, and
powers by which I may win honor from every event "?
No; but you sit trembling, for fear this or that
should happen, and lamenting and mourning and
groaning at what doth happen; and then you accuse
the gods! In what does such baseness end but in
impiety? And yet God has not only granted these
faculties by which we may bear every event without
being depressed or broken by it, but, like a good
prince and a true father, has placed their exercise
above restraint, compulsion, or hindrance, and wholly
within our own control; nor has he reserved a power,
even to himself, of hindering or restraining them.
Having these things free, and your own, will you not
use them, nor consider what you have received, nor
from whom? But you sit groaning and lamenting,
some of you, blind to him who gave them, and not
acknowledging your benefactor; while others basely
turn themselves to complaints and accusations against
God ! I undertake to show you that you have means
<pb id="p.1027"/>
and faculties to exhibit greatness of soul, and a manly
spirit; but what occasion you have to find fault and
complain, do you show me if you can.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Of the use of the forms of right reasoning.</head>
<p>It is not understood by most persons that the proper
use of inferences and hypotheses and interrogations, and logical forms generally, has any relation to
the duties of life. In every matter of action the question is, how a wise and good man may come honestly
and consistently out of it. We must admit, therefore,
either that the wise man will not engage in difficult
problems or that, if he does, he will not think it
worth his care to deal with them thoroughly; or if we
allow neither of these alternatives, it is necessary to
confess that some examination ought to be made of
those points on which the solution of these problems
chiefly depends. For what is reasoning? To lay
down true positions, to reject false ones, and to suspend the judgment in doubtful ones. Is it enough,
then, to have learned merely this? It is enough, say
you. Is it enough, then, for him who would not commit any mistake in the use of money, merely to have
heard that we are to receive the good pieces, and to
reject the bad? This is not enough. What must be
<pb id="p.1028"/>
added besides? That skill which tries and distinguishes what pieces are good, what bad. Therefore,
in reasoning too, the definition just given is not
enough; but it is necessary that we should be able to
prove and distinguish between the true and the false
and the doubtful. This is clear.</p>
<p>And what further is attempted in reasoning? To
admit the logical consequence of whatever you have
properly granted. Well, and is it enough merely to
know this necessity? It is not; but we must learn
how it happens that such a thing is the consequence
of such another, and when one thing follows from one
premise, and when from many premises. Is it not
moreover necessary that he who would acquit himself
skilfully in reasoning should both himself demonstrate
whatever he asserts and be able to comprehend the
demonstrations of others, and not be deceived by such
as use sophistry as if they were reasoning fairly?
Hence arises the use and practice of logical forms;
and it appears to be indispensable.</p>
<p>But it may possibly happen that from the premises
which we have honestly granted there arises some
consequence which, though false in itself, is nevertheless a fair inference. What then ought I to do? To
admit a falsehood? Impossible. To take back my
concessions? But this will not be allowed. Or assert that the consequence does not fairly follow from
the premises?  Nor is even this practicable. What
then, is to be done in the case? Is it not this? As
<pb id="p.1029"/>
the having once borrowed money is not enough to
make a person a debtor, unless he still continues to
owe money and has not paid it, so the having
granted the premises is not enough to make it necessary to grant the inference, unless we continue our
concessions. If the premises continue to the end
such as they were when the concessions were made, it
is absolutely necessary to continue the concessions,
and to admit what follows from them. But if the
premises do not continue such as they were when the
concession was made, it is absolutely necessary to revoke the concession, and refuse to accept the inference. For this inference is no consequence of ours,
nor belongs to us, when we have revoked the concession of the premises. We ought then thoroughly to
consider our premises and their different aspects, on
which any one, by laying hold, - either on the question itself or on the answer, or on the inference, or
elsewhere, -may embarrass the unthinking who did
not foresee the result. So that in this way we may not
be led into any unbecoming or confused position.</p>
<p>The same thing is to be observed in hypotheses and
hypothetical arguments. For it is sometimes necessary to require some hypothesis to be granted, as a
kind of step to the rest of the argument. Is every
given hypothesis, then, to be granted, or not every
one? and if not every one, which? And is he who has
granted an hypothesis forever to abide by it ! Or is
he sometimes to revoke it, and admit only conse-
<pb id="p.1030"/>
quences, but not to admit contradictions? Ay, but a
person may say, on your admitting a possible hypothesis, "I will drive you upon an impossibility."  With
such a one as this, shall the wise man never engage,
but avoid all argument and conversation with him?
And yet who beside the wise man is capable of treating an argument, or who beside is sagacious in reasoning, and incapable of being deceived and imposed on
by sophistry? Or will he indeed engage, but without
regarding whether he behaves rashly and heedlessly in
the argument? Yet how, then, can he be wise, as we
are supposing him? and without some such exercise
and preparation, how can he hold his own? If this
could be shown, then indeed all these forms of reasoning would be superfluous and absurd, and unconnected with our idea of the virtuous man.</p>
<p>Why, then, are we still indolent, and slothful, and
sluggish, seeking pretences of avoiding labor? Shall
we not be watchful to render reason itself accurate?
"But suppose, after all, I should make a mistake in
these points, - it is not as if I had killed my father."
O slavish man, in this case you had no father to kill.
but the only fault that you could commit in this instance, you have committed. This very thing I myself said
to <placeName key="tgn,2633122">Rufus</placeName> when he reproved me for not finding the weak point in some syllogism. "Why," said
I, "have I burnt the capitol then?"  "Slave !" answered he, "was the thing here involved the capitol?
Or are there no other faults but burning the capitol, or
<pb id="p.1031"/>
killing a father?"  And is it no fault to treat rashly,
and vainly, and heedlessly, the things which pass
before our eyes, - not to comprehend a reason, nor a
demonstration, nor a sophism; nor, in short, to see
what is strong in reasoning and what is weak? Is
there nothing wrong in this?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<head>That logical subtleties are not safe to the uninstructed.</head>
<p>In as many ways as equivalent syllogisms may be
varied, in so many may the technical forms be varied likewise. As, for instance: "If you had borrowed and not paid, you owe me money; but you
have not borrowed and not paid; therefore you do
not owe me money." To perform these processes
skilfully, is held to be the peculiar mark of a philosopher. For if an enthymema be an imperfect syllogism, he who is versed in the perfect syllogism must
be equally ready to detect an imperfect one.</p>
<p>"Why, then, do not we exercise ourselves and
others after this manner?"</p>
<p>Because, even now, though we are not wholly absorbed in these things, nor diverted, by me at least,
from the study of morality, yet we make no eminent
advances in virtue. What is to be expected, then, if
<pb id="p.1032"/>
we should add this avocation too?  Especially as it
would not only withdraw us from  more necessary
studies, but likewise afford a capital occasion of conceit and insolence. For the faculty of arguing and
of persuasive reasoning is great; and particularly, if
it is constantly practised, and receives an additional
ornament from rhetoric. In general, every such faculty is dangerous to weak and uninstructed persons,
as being apt to render them arrogant and elated.
For by what method can one persuade a young man
who excels in these kinds of study that he ought not
to be an appendage to these accomplishments, but
they to him? Will he not trample upon all such advice, and walk about elated and puffed up, not bearing that any one should touch him, to put him in
mind where he is wanting, and in what he goes
wrong?</p>
<p>"What, then, was not Plato a philosopher?"</p>
<p>Well, and was not Hippocrates a physician? Yet
you see how he expresses himself. But what has his
style to do with his professional qualities? Why do
you confound things accidentally united in the same
men? If Plato was handsome and well made, must I
too set myself to becoming handsome and well made,
- as if this was necessary to philosophy, because a certain person happened to be at once handsome and a
philosopher? Why will you not perceive and distinguish what are the things that make men philosophers,
and what belong to them on other accounts?  Pray,
<pb id="p.1033"/>
if I were a philosopher, would it be necessary that
you should be lame too [like me]?</p>
<p>What then? Do I reject these special faculties?
By no means; neither do I reject the faculty of seeing. But if you ask me what is the good of man, I
know not where it lies save in dealing wisely with the
phenomena of existence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<head>How from the doctrine of our relationship to god we are to deduce its consequences.</head>
<p></p><p rend="left">If what philosophers say of the kinship between
God and men be true, what has any one to do
but, like <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, when he is Asked what countryman
he is, never to say that he is a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, or of
<placeName key="tgn,7010734">Corinth</placeName>, but of the universe? For why, if you limit
yourself to <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, do you not farther limit yourself
to that mere corner of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> where your body was
brought forth? Is it not, evidently, from some larger
local tie, which comprehends, not only that comer
and your whole house, but the whole country of your
fathers, that you call yourself an Athenian, or a Corinthian? He, then, who understands the administration
of the universe, and has learned that the principal and
greatest and most comprehensive of all things is this
vast system, extending from men to God: and that
<pb id="p.1034"/>
from Him the seeds of being are descended not only
to one's father or grandfather, but to all things that
are produced and born on earth; and especially to
rational natures, since they alone are qualified to partake of a communication with the Deity, being connected with him by reason, - why may not such a one
call himself a citizen of the universe ! Why not a son
of God? And why shall he fear any thing that happens among men? Shall kinship to Caesar, or any
other of the great at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, enable a man to live secure, above contempt, and void of all fear whatever;
and shall not the having God for our maker, and
father, and guardian, free us from griefs and alarms?</p>
<p>"But wherewithal shall I be fed?  For I have
nothing."</p>
<p>To what do fugitive slaves trust when they run
away from their masters? Is it to their estates, -
their servants,- their plate?  To nothing but themselves. Yet they do not fail to obtain the necessaries
of life. And must a philosopher, think you, leave his
own abode to rest and rely upon others, and not take
care of himself? Must he be more helpless and
anxious than the brute beasts?  -each of which is self-sufficient, and wants neither proper food nor any suitable and natural provision. One would think that
you would need an instructor, not to guard you from
thinking too meanly or ignobly of yourselves, but
that his business would be to rear up young men of
such a spirit that, knowing their affinity to the gods,
<pb id="p.1035"/>
and that we are as it were fettered by the body and
its possessions, and by so many other things as are thus
made needful for the daily pursuits of life, they should
resolve to throw them all off, as both troublesome and
useless, and depart to their divine kindred.</p>
<p>This is the work, if any, that ought to employ your
master and preceptor if you had one, that you should
come to him and say: " Epictetus, we can no longer
bear being tied down to this poor body, - feeding, and
resting, and cleaning it, and vexed with so many low
cares on its account. Are not these things indifferent, and nothing to us, and death no evil? Are we
not of kindred to God; and did we not come from
him?  Suffer us to go back thither from whence we
came. Suffer us at length to be delivered from these
fetters that bind and weigh us down. Here thieves
and robbers, courts and tyrants, claim power over us,
through the body and its possessions. Suffer us to
show them that they have no power."</p>
<p>And in this case it would be my part to answer:
"My friends, wait for God, till he shall give the signal
and dismiss you from this service; then return to
him. For the present, be content to remain at this
post where he has placed you. The time of your
abode here is short and easy to such as are disposed
like you; for what tyrant, what robber, what thief, or
what court can be formidable to those who thus count
for nothing the body and its possessions. Stay, nor
foolishly depart."
<pb id="p.1036"/></p>
<p>Thus ought the case to stand between a preceptor
and ingenuous young men. But how stands it now?
The preceptor has no life in him, and you have
none. When you have had enough to-day, you sit
weeping about to-morrow, in regard to how you shall
get food. Why, if you have it, slave, you will have
it; if not, you will go out of life. The door is open,
why do you lament; what room remains for tears;
what occasion for flattery? Why should any one
person envy another?  Why should he be impressed
with awe by those who have great possessions, or are
placed in high rank, - especially, if they are powerful
and passionate?  For what can they do to us? The
things which they can do, we do not regard; the
things about which we are concerned, they cannot
reach. Who, then, after all, shall hold sway over a
person thus disposed? How behaved Socrates in regard to these things? As it became one conscious
of kinship with the gods. He said to his judges:--</p>
<p>If you should tell me, ' We will acquit you upon
condition that you shall no longer discourse in the
manner you have hitherto done, nor make any disturbance among either our young or our old people,'
I would answer: ' You are ridiculous in thinking that
if your general had placed me in any post I ought
to maintain and defend it, and choose to die a thousand times, rather than desert it, but that if God has
assigned me any station or method of life, I ought to
desert that for you.'
<pb id="p.1037"/></p>
<p>This it is for a man to truly recognize his relationship with God, But we habitually think of ourselves
as [made up of] mere stomach and intestines and
bodily parts. Because we fear, because we desire, we
flatter those who can help us in these matters; we
dread them too.</p>
<p>A person desired me once to write for him to
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He was one vulgarly esteemed unfortunate,
as he had been formerly illustrious and rich, and was
afterwards stripped of all his possessions, and reduced
to live here. I wrote for him in a submissive style;
but after reading my letter he returned it to me and
said: "I wanted your assistance, not your pity; for
no evil has befallen me."</p>
<p>Thus Rufus, to try me, used to say, " This or that
you will have from your master." When I answered
him, "These are mere human affairs," "Why, then,"
says he, " should I intercede with him,<note anchored="yes">This is a disputed passage, and something is probably lost.- H.</note> when you can
receive from yourself things more important?" For
what one has of his own, it is superfluous and vain to
receive from another. Shall I, then, who can receive
nobleness and a manly spirit from myself, receive an
estate, or a sum of money, or a place, from you?
Heaven forbid! I will not be so insensible of my
own possessions. But if a person is fearful and abject,
what else is necessary but to apply for permission to
bury him as if he were dead?  " Please forward to us
<pb id="p.1038"/>
the corpse of such a one." For, in fact, such a one is
that, and nothing more. If he were anything more,
he would be sensible that man is not to be made
miserable at the will of his fellow-man.</p></div2>

<head>Concerning those who seek preferment at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</head>
<p>If we all applied ourselves as heartily to our proper
business as the old politicians at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to their
schemes, perhaps we too might accomplish something.
I know a man older than I am, who is now a commissary at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. When he passed through this place,
on his return from exile, what an account did he give
me of his former life; and how did he promise that
for the future, when he had returned he would apply
himself to nothing but how to spend the remainder of
his days in repose and tranquillity. "For how few
have I now remaining! " he said. "You will not do
it," said I. "When you are once within reach of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> you will forget all this; and if you can but
once gain admittance to court, you will be rejoiced
and thank God." "It you ever find me, Epictetus,"
said he, "putting one foot into the court, think of me
whatever you please." Yet, after all, how did he act?
Before he entered the city he was met by a letter
from Caesar. On receiving it he forgot all his former
<pb id="p.1039"/>
resolutions; and has ever since been accumulating
affairs upon himself. I should be glad now to have
an opportunity of putting him in mind of his discourse
upon the road, and of pointing out by how much I
was the truer prophet.</p>
<p>What, then, do I say? that man is made for an inactive life? No, surely. But why is not this life of
ours fill of action?  For my own part, I wake at
dawn with my head full of my lessons for the coming
day, and then say to myself, quickly, What is it to me
how such a one recites? My present business is to

<p>What comparison can be made between their kind
of activity and ours?  If you consider what it is they
do, you will see; for about what are they employed
the whole day but in calculating, contriving, consulting, - about provisions, about an estate, or other
interests like these?  Is there any likeness, then,
between reading a petition, " I entreat you to give me
a permission to export corn," and this, " I entreat
you to learn from Chrysippus what the administration
of the universe is, and what place a reasonable creature holds in it; learn, too, what you yourself are,
and wherein your good and evil consist"? Are these
things at all alike? Do they require an equal degree
of application? And is it no more shameful to neglect the one than the other?</p>
<p>Well, then, are we older men the only idle dreamers?</p>

Epictetus likewise inquired, In what manner do you
live with them?  "Very miserably," says he. How
so?  For men do not marry, and have children, in
order to be miserable, but rather to make themselves
happy. "But I am so very miserable about my
children that the other day, when my daughter was
sick and appeared to be in danger, I could not bear
even to be with her, but ran away, till it was told me
that she was recovered." And pray do you think this
was acting right? " It was acting naturally," said he.
Well, do but convince me that it was acting naturally, and I can as well convince you that everything
natural is right. "All, or most of us fathers, are
affected in the same way." I do not deny the fact;
but the question between us is, whether it is right.
<pb id="p.1041"/>
For by this way of reasoning it must be said that
diseases happen for the good of the body, because
they do happen; and even that vices are natural, because all, or most of us, are guilty of them. Do you
show me, then, how such a behavior as yours appears
to be natural.</p>
<p>" I cannot undertake that; but do you rather show
me that it is neither natural nor right."</p>
<p>If we were disputing about black and white, what
criterion must we call in, to distinguish them?</p>
<p>"The sight."
If about hot and cold, or hard and soft, what?
"The touch."</p>
<p>Well, then, when we are debating about natural
and unnatural and right and wrong what criterion
are we to take?</p>
<p>"I cannot tell."</p>
<p>And yet to be ignorant of a criterion of colors, or
of smells, or tastes, might perhaps be no very great
loss; but do you think that he suffers only a small
loss who is ignorant of what is good and evil, and
natural and unnatural to man?</p>
<p>" No, - the very greatest."</p>
<p>Well, tell me; are all things which are judged good
and proper by some rightly judged to be so? Thus,
is it possible that the several opinions of Jews, and
Syrians, and Egyptians, and Romans, concerning food
should all be right?</p>
<p>" How can it be possible? "
<pb id="p.1042"/></p>
<p>I suppose, then, it is absolutely necessary that, if the
opinions of the Egyptians be right, the others must be
wrong; if those of the Jews be good, all the rest must
be bad.</p>
<p>" How can it be otherwise? "</p>
<p>And where ignorance is, there likewise is want of
wisdom and instruction in the most necessary points.</p>
<p>"It is granted."</p>
<p>Then, as you are sensible of this, you will for the
future apply yourself to nothing, and think of nothing
else, but how to learn the criterion of what is agreeable to nature; and to use that in judging of each
particular case. At present the assistance I have to
give you towards what you desire is this: Does affection seem to you to be a right and a natural thing?</p>
<p>" How should it be otherwise? "</p>
<p>Well, and is affection natural and right, and reason
not so?</p>
<p>"By no means."</p>
<p>Is there any opposition, then, between reason and
affection?</p>
<p>"I think not."</p>
<p>Suppose there were; if one of two opposites be natural, the other must necessarily be unnatural, must
it not?</p>
<p>" It must."</p>
<p>What we find, then, to accord at once with love and
reason, that we may safely pronounce to be right and
good.
<pb id="p.1043"/></p>
<p>" Agreed."</p>
<p>Well, then; you will not dispute this, that to run
away, and leave a sick child, is contrary to reason.
It remains for us to consider whether it be consistent
with affection.</p>
<p>" Let us consider it."</p>
<p>Did you, then, from an affection to your child, do
right in running away and leaving her? Has her
mother no affection for the child?</p>
<p>"Yes, surely she has."</p>
<p>Would it have been right, then, that her mother too
should leave her, or would it not?</p>
<p>"It would not."</p>
<p>And does not her nurse love her?</p>
<p>" She does."</p>
<p>Then ought she likewise to leave her?</p>
<p>"By no means."</p>
<p>And does not her preceptor love her?</p>
<p>"He does."</p>
<p>Then ought he also to have run away and left her
- -the child being thus left alone and unassisted, from
the great affection of her parents and her friends, or
left to die among people who neither loved her nor
took care of her?</p>
<p>"Heaven forbid !"</p>
<p>But is it not unreasonable and unjust that what you
think right in yourself, on account of your affection,
should not be allowed to others, who have the very
same affection with you
<pb id="p.1044"/></p>
<p>" It is absurd."</p>
<p>Pray, if you were ill yourself should you be willing
to have your family, and even your wife and children,
so very affectionate as to leave you helpless and alone?</p>
<p>" By no means."</p>
<p>Or would you wish to be so loved by your friends
as from their excessive affection always to be left alone
when you were ill? Or would you not rejoice, if it
were possible, to have such a kind of affection from
your enemies, as to make them thus let you alone?
If so, it remains, that your behavior was by no means
affectionate. But now, was there no other motive that
induced you to desert your child?</p>
<p>"How is that possible? "</p>
<p>I mean some such motive as induced a person at
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to hide his face while a horse was running to
which he earnestly wished success; and when, beyond
his expectation, it won the race he was obliged himself to be sponged, to recover from his faintness.</p>
<p>" And what was this motive? "</p>
<p>At present, perhaps, it cannot be made clear to you.
It is sufficient to be convinced, if what philosophers
say be true, that we are not to seek any motive merely
from without; but that there is the same [unseen]
motive in all cases, which moves us to do or forbear
any action; to speak or not to speak; to be elated or
depressed; to avoid or pursue, - that very impulse
which hath now moved us two; you, to come, and sit
and hear me; and me, to speak as I do.
<pb id="p.1045"/></p>
<p>"And what is that? "</p>
<p>Is it anything else than that it seemed right to us
to do so?</p>
<p>"Nothing else."</p>
<p>And if it had seemed otherwise to us. what else
should we have done than what we thought right?
This, and not the death of Patroclus, was the real
source of the lamentation of Achilles, -for every
man is not thus affected by the death of a friend, -
that it seemed right to him. This too was the cause
of your running away from your child, that it then
seemed right; and if hereafter you should stay with
her, it will be because that seems right. You are now
returning to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> because it seems right to you; but
if you should alter your opinion you will not return.
In a word, neither death, nor exile, nor pain, nor anything of this kind, is the real cause of our doing or not
doing any action, but our inward opinions and principles. Do I convince you of this, or not?</p>
<p>" You do."</p>
<p>Well, then, such as the cause is, such will be the
effect. From this day forward, then, whenever we do
anything wrong, we will impute it to the wrong principle from which we act; and we will endeavor to remove and extirpate that, with greater care than we
would remove wens and tumors from the body. In
like manner, we will ascribe what we do right to the
same cause; and we will accuse neither servant, nor
neighbor, nor wife, nor children, as the cause of any
<pb id="p.1046"/>
evil to us, - persuaded that if we had not accepted
certain principles, we should not carry them to such
consequences. The control of these principles lies in
us, and not in any outward things. Of these principles we ourselves, and not things outward, are the
masters.</p>
<p>" Agreed."</p>
<p>From this day, then, we will not so closely inquire
as to any external conditions,- estate or slaves, or
horses, or dogs,- but only make sure of our own
principles.</p>
<p>"Such is my desire," said the visitor.</p>
<p>You see, then, that it is necessary for you to become
a student, that being whom every one laughs at, if you
really desire to make an examination of your own
principles; but this, as you should know, is not the
work of an hour or a day.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Of contentment.</head>
<p>Concerning the gods, some affirm that there
is no deity; others, that he indeed exists, but
is slothful, negligent, and without providential care; a
third class admits both his being and his providence,
but only in respect to great and heavenly objects, not
earthly; a fourth recognizes him both in heaven and
<pb id="p.1047"/>
earth, but only in general, not individual matters; a
fifth, like Odysseus and Socrates, says, " I cannot be
hid from thee in any of my motions."<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.1">Xenophon, Mem. 1.1</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.278">Homer, Iliad, 10.278.</bibl> - H.</note></p>
<p>It is, before all things, necessary to examine each
of these opinions; which is, and which is not rightly
spoken. Now, if there are no gods, wherefore serve
them? If there are, but they take no care of anything, how is the case bettered?  Or, if they both are,
and take care; yet, if there is nothing communicated
from them to men, and therefore certainly nothing to
me, how much better is it? A wise and good man,
after examining these things, submits his mind to
Him who administers the whole, as good citizens do
to the laws of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>He, then, who comes to be instructed, ought to
come with this aim: " How may I in everything follow the gods? How may I acquiesce in the divine
administration? And how may I be free? "  For he
is free to whom all happens agreeably to his desire,
and whom no one can unduly restrain.</p>
<p>"What, then, is freedom mere license?"</p>
<p>By no means; for madness and freedom are incompatible.</p>
<p>"But I would have that happen which appears to
me desirable, however it comes to appear so."</p>
<p>You are mad; you have lost your senses. Do not
you know that freedom is a very beautiful and valuable thing? But for me to choose at random, and
<pb id="p.1048"/>
for things to happen agreeably to such a choice, may
be so far from a beautiful thing, as to be of all things
the most undesirable. For how do we proceed in
writing? Do I choose to write the name of <placeName key="tgn,1123427">Dion</placeName>
(for instance) as I will? No, but I am taught to be
willing to write it as it ought to be written. And what
is the case in music? The same. And what in every
other art or science? Otherwise, it would be of no
purpose to learn anything if it were to be adapted to
each one's particular humor. Is it, then, only in the
greatest and principal matter, that of freedom, permitted me to desire at random? By no means; but
true instruction is this, - learning to desire that
things should happen as they do. And how do they
happen? As the appointer of them hath appointed.
He hath appointed that there should be summer and
winter, plenty and dearth, virtue and vice, and all such
contrarieties, for the harmony of the whole. To each
of us he has given a body and its parts, and our several possessions and companions. Mindful of this appointment, we should enter upon a course of education
and instruction, not in order to change the constitution of things,- a gift neither practicable nor desirable,-but that, things being as they are with regard
to us, we may have our minds accommodated to the
facts. Can we, for instance, flee from mankind?
How is that possible? Can we, by conversing with
them, transform them? Who has given us such a
power? What, then, remains, or what method is there
<pb id="p.1049"/>
to be found, for such a commerce with them that,
while they act according to the appearances in their
own minds, we may nevertheless be affected conformably to nature?</p>
<p>But you are wretched and discontented. If you
are alone, you term it a desert; and if with men, you
call them cheats and robbers. You find fault too
with your parents, and children, and brothers, and
neighbors. Whereas you ought, if you live alone, to
call that repose and freedom, and to esteem yourself
as resembling the gods; and when you are in company, not to call it a crowd, and a tumult, and a trouble, but an assembly, and a festival, - and thus to take
all things contentedly. What, then, is the punishment
of those who do not so accept them?  To be as
they are. Is any one discontented with being alone?
Let him remain in his desert. Discontented with his
parents?  Let him be a bad son; and let him mourn,
Discontented with his children? Let him be a bad
father. Shall we throw him into prison?  What prison?
Where he already is; for he is in a situation against his
will, and wherever any one is against his will, that is
to him a prison, -just as Socrates was not truly in
prison, for he was willingly there.</p>
<p>"What, then, must my leg be lame? "</p>
<p>And is it for one paltry leg, wretch, that you accuse
the universe?  Can you not forego that, in consider
tion of the whole? Can you not give up something?
Can you not gladly yield it to him who gave it? And
<pb id="p.1050"/>
will you be angry and discontented with the decrees
of Zeus, - which he, with the Fates, who spun in his
presence the thread of your birth, ordained and appointed? Do not you know how very small a part
you are of the whole? - that is, as to body; for, as to
reason, you are neither worse nor less than divine.
For reason is not measured by size or height, but by
principles. Will you not, therefore, place your good
there where you share with the gods?</p>
<p>"But how wretched am I, in such a father and
mother !"</p>
<p>What, then, was it granted you to come beforehand,
and make your own terms, and say, "I et such and
such persons, at this hour, be the authors of my
birth"? It was not granted; for it was necessary
that your parents should exist before you, and so you
be born afterwards. Of whom? Of just such as they
were. What, then, since they are such, is there no
remedy afforded you?  Surely, you would be wretched
and miserable if you knew not the use of sight, and
shut your eyes in presence of colors; and are not you
more wretched and miserable in being ignorant that
you have within you the needful nobleness and manhood wherewith to meet these accidents? Events proportioned to your reason are brought before you; but
you turn your mind away, at the very time when you
ought to have it the most open and discerning. Why
do not you rather thank the gods that they have made
you superior to those events which they have not placed
<pb id="p.1051"/>
within your own control, and have rendered you accountable for that only which is within your own control? They discharge you from all responsibility for
your parents, for your brothers, for your body, possessions, death, life. For what, then, have they made
you responsible?  For that which is alone in your own
power,- a right use of things as they appear. Why,
then, should you draw those cares upon yourself for
which you are not accountable? This is giving one's
self vexation without need.</p></div2>

<head>How everything may be performed to the divine acceptance.</head>
<p>When a person inquired how any one might
eat to the divine acceptance, If he eats with
justice, said Epictetus, and with gratitude, and fairly,
and temperately, and decently, must he not also eat to
the divine acceptance?  And if you call for hot water,
and your servant does not hear you, or, if he does,
brings it only warm, or perhaps is not to be found at
home, then to abstain from anger or petulance, is not
this to the divine acceptance?</p>
<p>" But how is it possible to bear such things? "</p>
<p>O slavish man ! will you not bear with your own
brother, who has God for his Father, as being a son
<pb id="p.1052"/>
from the same stock, and of the same high descent?
But if you chance to be placed in some superior station, will you presently set yourself up for a tyrant?
Will you not remember what you are, and over whom
you bear rule, -that they are by nature your relations, your brothers; that they are the offspring of
God?</p>
<p>"But I have them by right of purchase, and not

<head>That all things are under the divine supervision.</head>
<p>When a person asked him, how any one might
be convinced that his every act is under the
supervision of God? Do not you think, said Epictetus, that all things are mutually connected and
united?</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>Well; and do not you think that things on earth
feel the influence of the heavenly powers?</p>
<p>"Yes."
<pb id="p.1053"/></p>
<p>Else how is it that in their season, as if by express
command, God bids the plants to blossom and they
blossom, to bud and they bud, to bear fruit and they
bear it, to ripen it and they ripen; and when again
he bids them drop their leaves, and withdrawing into
themselves to rest and wait, they rest and wait?
Whence again are there seen, on the increase and decrease of the moon, and the approach and departure
of the sun, so great changes and transformations in
earthly things?  Have, then, the very leaves, and our
own bodies, this connection and sympathy with the
whole, and have not our souls much more? But
our souls are thus connected and intimately joined to
God, as being indeed members and distinct portions
of his essence; and must he not be sensible of every
movement of them, as belonging and connatural to
himself? Can even you think of the divine administration, and every other divine subject, and together
with these of human affairs also; can you at once receive impressions on your senses and your understanding from a thousand objects; at once assent to some
things, deny or suspend your judgment concerning
others, and preserve in your mind impressions from
so many and various objects, by whose aid you can
revert to ideas similar to those which first impressed
you?  Can you retain a variety of arts and the memorials of ten thousand things?  And is not God capable of surveying all things, and being present with all,
and in communication with all? Is the sun capable
<pb id="p.1054"/>
of illuminating so great a portion of the universe, and
of leaving only that small part of it unilluminated,
which is covered by the shadow of the earth, and
cannot He who made and moves the sun, a small part
of himself, if compared with the whole, - cannot he
perceive all things?</p>
<p>"But I cannot," say you, "attend to all things at
once." Who asserts that you have equal power with
Zeus? Nevertheless, he has assigned to each man a
director, his own good genius, and committed him to
that guardianship, - a director sleepless and not to be
deceived. To what better and more careful guardian
could he have committed each one of us? So that
when you have shut your doors, and darkened your
room, remember never to say that you are alone;
for you are not alone, but God is within, and your
genius is within; and what need have they of light
to see what you are doing? To this God you likewise ought to swear such an oath as the soldiers do to
Caesar. For they, in order to receive their pay, swear
to prefer before all things the safety of Caesar; and
will you not swear, who have received so many and so
great favors; or, if you have sworn, will you not fulfil
the oath? And what must you swear?  Never to distrust, nor accuse, nor murmur at any of the things appointed by him; nor to shrink from doing or enduring
that which is inevitable. Is this oath like the former
In the first oath persons swear never to dishonor

<head>What philosophy promises.</head>
<p>When one consulted him, how he might persuade his brother to forbear treating him ill,
Philosophy, answered Epictetus, does not promise
to procure any outward good for man; otherwise it
would include something beyond its proper theme.
For as the material of a carpenter is wood; of a statuary, brass; so of the art of living, the material is each
man's own life.</p>
<p>"What, then, is my brother's life? "</p>
<p>That, again, is matter for his own art, but is external
to you; like property, health, or reputation. Philosophy undertakes none of these. In every circumstance I will keep my will in harmony with nature.
To whom belongs that will? To Him in whom I
exist.</p>
<p>"But how, then, is my brother's unkindness to be
cured?"</p>
<p>Bring him to me, and I will tell him; but I have
nothing to say to you about his unkindness.</p>
<p>But the inquirer still further asking for a rule for
self-government, if he should not be reconciled, Epictetus answered thus, -</p>
<p>No great thing is created suddenly, any more than
<pb id="p.1056"/>
a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you
desire a fig, I answer you, that there must be time.
Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen. Since,
then, the fruit of a fig-tree is not brought to perfection suddenly, or in one hour, do you think to possess instantaneously and easily the fruit of the human
mind?  I warn you, expect it not.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Of providence.</head>
<p>Be not surprised if other animals have all things
necessary to the body ready provided for them,
not only meat and drink, but lodging; if they want
neither shoes nor bedding nor clothes, while we
stand in need of all these. For they not being made
for themselves, but for service, it was not fit that they
should be so formed as to be waited on by others.
For consider what it would be for us to take care,
not only for ourselves, but for sheep and asses too,-
how they should be clothed, how shod, and how they
should eat and drink. But as soldiers are furnished
ready for their commander, shod, clothed, and armed,
- for it would be a grievous thing for a colonel to be
obliged to go through his regiment to put on their
clothes, - so nature has furnished these useful animals, ready provided, and standing in need of no fur-
<pb id="p.1057"/>
ther care; so that one little boy, with only a crook,
drives a flock.</p>
<p>But we, instead of being thankful for this, complain
of God that there is not the same kind of care taken
of us likewise; and yet, good Heaven! any one
thing in the creation is sufficient to demonstrate a
Providence, to a humble and grateful mind. Not to
instance great things, the mere possibility of producing milk from grass, cheese from milk, and wool from
skins,- who formed and planned this?  No one, say
you. O surprising irreverence and dulness!  But
come, let us omit the primary works of nature; let us
contemplate her merely incidental traits. What is
more useless than the hairs upon one's chin? And yet
has she not made use even of these, in the most becoming manner possible?  Has she not by these distinguished the sexes? Does not nature in each of us
call out, even at a distance, I am a man; approach
and address me as such; inquire no further; see the
characteristic? On the other hand, with regard to
women, as she has mixed something softer in their
voice, so she has deprived them of a beard. But no;
[some think] this living being should have been left
undistinguished, and each of us should be obliged to
proclaim, " I am a man ! " But why is not this characteristic beautiful and becoming and venerable?  How
much more beautiful than the comb of cocks; how
much more noble than the mane of lions! Therefore
we ought to preserve the characteristics made by the
<pb id="p.1058"/>
Creator; we ought not to reject them, nor confound,
as much as in us lies, the distinct sexes.</p>
<p>Are these the only works of Providence with regard to us? And what speech can fitly celebrate their
praise? For, if we had any understanding, ought we
not, both in public and in private, incessantly to
sing and praise the Deity, and rehearse his benefits?
Ought we not, whether we dig or plough or eat, to
sing this hymn to God, - Great is God, who has supplied us with these instruments to till the ground;
great is God, who has given us hands and organs of
digestion; who has given us to grow insensibly, to
breathe in sleep? These things we ought forever to
celebrate; and to make it the theme of the greatest
and divinest hymn, that he has given us the power to
appreciate these gifts, and to use them well. But because the most of you are blind and insensible, there
must be some one to fill this station, and lead, in behalf of all men, the hymn to God; for what else can I
do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God? Were
I a nightingale, I would act the part of a nightingale
were I a swan, the part of a swan; but since I am a
reasonable creature, it is my duty to praise God. This
is my business; I do it; nor will I ever desert this
post, so long as it is permitted me; and I call on you
to join in the same song.

<head>That the art of reasoning is necessary.</head>
<p>Since it is Reason which shapes and regulates all
other things, it ought not itself to be left in disorder; but by what shall it be regulated?  Evidently,
either by itself, or by something else. Well, either that
too is Reason, or something else superior to Reason,
which is impossible; and if it be Reason, what again
shall regulate that? For if this Reason can regulate
itself, so can the former; and if we still require any
further agent, the series will be infinite and without
end.</p>
<p>" But," say you, " the essential thing is to prescribe
for qualities of character."</p>
<p>Would you hear about these, therefore? Well,
hear. But then, if you say to me that you cannot tell
whether my arguments are true or false, and if I happen to express myself ambiguously, and you bid me
make it clearer, I will then at once show you that
this is the first essential. Therefore, I suppose, they
first establish the art of reasoning, - just as before the
measuring of corn, we settle the measure; for, unless
we first determine the measure and the weight, how
shall we be able to measure or weigh? Thus, in the
present case, unless we have first learned and fixed
<pb id="p.1060"/>
that which is the criterion of other things, and by
which other things are learned, how shall we be able
accurately to learn anything else? How is it possible?
Well, a bushel-measure is only wood, a thing of no
value, but it measures corn; and logic is of no value
in itself. That we will consider hereafter, but grant it
now; it is enough that it distinguishes and examines,
and, as one may say, measures and weighs all other
things. Who says this? Is it only Chrysippus, and
<placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, and Cleanthes? Does not Antisthenes say it?
And who is it, then, who has written that the beginning of a right education is the examination of words?
Does not <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> say it? Of whom, then, does
Xenophon write, that he began by the examination of
words, what each signified?</p>
<p>Is this, then, the great and admirable thing, to understand or interpret Chrysippus?</p>
<p>Who says that it is? But what, then, is the admirable thing?</p>
<p>To understand the will of nature.</p>
<p>Well, then; do you conform to it yourself?  In that
case, what need have you for any one else?  For if it
be true that men err but unwillingly, and if you have
learnt the truth, you must needs act rightly.</p>
<p>But, indeed, I do not conform to the will of
nature.</p>
<p>Who, then, shall interpret that?</p>
<p>They say, Chrysippus. I go and inquire what this
interpreter of nature says. Soon I cannot understand
<pb id="p.1061"/>
his meaning; I seek one to interpret that. I call on
him to explain everything as clearly as if it were in
Latin. Yet what right has this last interpreter to
boast?  Nor has Chrysippus himself, so long as he
only interprets the will of nature, and does not follow
it; and much less has his interpreter. For we have no
need of Chrysippus on his own account; but that, by
his means, we may apprehend the will of nature; just
as no one values a diviner on his own account, but
that, by his assistance, men hope to understand future
events and heavenly indications; nor the auguries, on
their own account, but on account of what is signified
by them; neither is it the raven, or the crow, that is
admired, but the divine purposes displayed through
their means. Thus I come to the diviner and interpreter of these higher things, and say, "Inspect the
auguries for me: what is signified for me?"  Having
taken, and inspected them, he thus interprets them:
You have a free will, O man ! incapable of being restrained or compelled. This is written here in the
auguries. I will show you this, first, in the faculty of
assent. Can any one restrain you from assenting to
truth? No one. Can any one compel you to admit
a falsehood? No one. You see, then, that you have
here a free will, incapable of being restrained, or compelled, or hindered. Well, is it otherwise with regard
to pursuit and desire? What can displace one pursuit. Another pursuit. What [can displace] desire
and aversion? Another desire and another aversion.
<pb id="p.1062"/>
"If you offer <emph>death</emph> as an alternative," say you, you
compel me. No, not the alternative does it, but
your conviction that it is better to do such a thing
than to die. Here, again, you see that it is your own
conviction which compels you, - that is, choice compels choice; for if God had constituted that portion
which he has separated from his own essence, and
given to us, capable of being restrained or compelled,
either by himself, or by any other, he would not have
been God, nor have fitly cared for us.</p>
<p>These things, says the diviner, I find in the auguries. These things are announced to you. If you
please, you are free. If you please, you will have no
one to complain of, no one to accuse. All will be
equally according to your own mind, and to the mind
of God.</p>
<p>For the sake of this oracle, I go to this diviner and
philosopher; admiring not alone him for his interpretation, but also the things which he interprets.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<head>That we ought not to be angry with the erring.</head>
<p>If what the philosophers say be true, that all men's
actions proceed from one source; that as they
assent from a persuasion that a thing is so, and
dissent from a persuasion that it is not, and suspend
<pb id="p.1063"/>
their judgment from a persuasion that it is uncertain;
so, likewise, they seek a thing from a persuasion that it
is for their advantage, - and it is impossible to esteem
one thing advantageous, and yet desire another; to
esteem one thing a duty, and yet pursue another,
why, after all, should we be angry at the multitude?</p>
<p>"They are thieves and robbers."</p>
<p>What do you mean by thieves and robbers? They
are in an error concerning good and evil. Ought
you, then, to be angry, or rather to pity them? Do
but show them their error, and you will see that they
will amend their faults; but if they do not see the
error, they will rise no higher than their convictions.</p>
<p>"What, then; ought not this thief and this adulterer to be destroyed?  "</p>
<p>Nay, call him rather one who errs and is deceived
in things of the greatest importance; blinded, not in
the vision, that distinguishes white from black, but in
the reason, that discerns good from evil. By stating
your question thus, you would see how inhuman it is,
and just as if you should say, "Ought not this blind
or that deaf man to be destroyed?"   For, if the
greatest hurt be a deprivation of the most valuable
things, and the most valuable thing to every one be
rectitude of will; when any one is deprived of this,
why, after all, are you angry? You ought not to be
affected, O man ! contrary to nature, by the evil deeds
of another. Pity him rather. Yield not to hatred
and anger; nor say, as many do, " What! shall these
<pb id="p.1064"/>
execrable and odious wretches dare to act thus?"
Whence have <emph>you</emph> so suddenly learnt wisdom?</p>
<p>Why are we thus enraged? Because we make
idols of those things which such people take from us.
Make not an idol of your clothes, and you will not be
enraged with the thief. Make not an idol of a woman's
beauty, and you will not be enraged with an adulterer.
Know, that thief and adulterer cannot reach the things
that are properly your own; but those only which
belong to others, and are not within your power. If
you can give up these things, and look upon them as
not essential, with whom will you any longer be enraged? But while you idolize them, be angry with
yourself, rather than with others. Consider the case:
you have a fine suit of clothes, your neighbor has not.
You have a casement; you want to air them. He
knows not in what the good of man consists, but imagines it is in a fine suit of clothes, just as you
imagine. Shall he not come and take them away?
When you show a cake to greedy people, and are devouring it all yourself, would you not have them snatch
it from you? Do not tempt them. Do not have a
casement. Do not expose your clothes. I, too, the
other day, had an iron lamp burning before my household deities. Hearing a noise at the window, I ran.
I found my lamp was stolen.  I considered that he
who took it away did nothing unaccountable. What
then? I said, to-morrow you shall find an earthen
one, for a man loses only what he has. "I have lost
<pb id="p.1065"/>
my coat."  Ay, because you had a coat. "I have
a pain in my head." You certainly can have none in
your horns. Why, then, are you out of humor? For
loss and pain can be only of such things as are
possessed.</p>
<p>But the tyrant will chain - what?  A leg. He will
take away-what? A head. What is there, then,
chat he .can neither chain nor take away? The free
will. Hence the advice of the ancients, - Know
thyself.</p>
<p>"What, then, ought we to do? "</p>
<p>Practise yourself, for Heaven's sake, in little things,
and thence proceed to greater. "I have a pain in
my head."  Do not lament. "I have a pain in my
ear."  Do not lament. I do not say you may never
groan, but do not groan in spirit; or if your servant
be a long while in bringing you something to bind
your head, do not croak and go into hysterics, and say,
"( Everybody hates me." For who would not hate
such a one?</p>
<p>Relying for the future on these principles, walk
erect and free, not trusting to bulk of body, like a
wrestler; for one should not be unconquerable in the
sense that an ass is.</p>
<p>Who, then, is unconquerable? He whom the inevitable cannot overcome. For such a person I imagine
every trial, and watch him as an athlete in each. He
has been victorious in the first encounter. What will
he do in the second? What, if he should be ex-
<pb id="p.1066"/>
hausted by the heat? What, if the field be <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>?
And so in other trials. If you throw money in his
way, he will despise it. Is he proof against the seductions of women?  What if he be tested by fame.
by calumny, by praise, by death? He is able to overcome them all. If he can bear sunshine and storm,
discouragement and fatigue, I pronounce him an athlete unconquered indeed.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<head>Of the right treatment of tyrants.</head>
<p>When a person is possessed of some personal
advantage, either real or imaginary, he will necessarily be puffed up with it, unless he has been well
instructed. A tyrant openly says, " I am supreme over
all." And what can you bestow on me? Can you
exempt my desires from disappointment? How should
you?  For do you never incur what you shun?  Are
your own aims infallible?  Whence came you by that
privilege?  Pray, on shipboard, do you trust to yourself, or to the pilot  In a chariot, to whom but the
driver? And to whom in all other arts? Just the
same. In what, then, does your power consist?</p>
<p>"All men pay regard to me."</p>
<p>So do I to my desk. I wash it and wipe it, and
drive a nail for my oil-flask.
<pb id="p.1067"/></p>
<p>"What, then; are these things to be valued beyond
me?"</p>
<p>No; but they are of some use to me, and therefore
I pay regard to them. Why, do I not pay regard to
an ass? Do I not wash his feet? Do I not clean
him?  Do not you know that every one pays such
regard even to himself; and that he does it to you,
just as he does to an ass? For who pays regard to
you as a man?  Show that. Who would wish to be
like you? Who would desire to imitate you, as he
would <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>?</p>
<p>" But I can take off your head."</p>
<p>You say rightly. I had forgot that one is to pay
regard to you as to a fever, or the cholera; and that
there should be an altar erected to you, as there is to
the goddess Fever at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</p>
<p>What is it, then, that disturbs and terrifies the multitude,--the tyrant and his guards? By no means.
What is by nature free cannot be disturbed or restrained by anything but itself; but its own convictions disturb it. Thus, when the tyrant says to any
one, " I will chain your leg," he who chiefly values his
leg cries out for pity; while he who chiefly values his
own free will says, <emph>"If</emph> you imagine it for your interest,
chain it."</p>
<p>"What! do you not care? "
No, I do not care.
"I will show you that I am master."</p>
<p>You?   How should you?   Zeus has set me free.
<pb id="p.1068"/>
What! do you think he would suffer his own son to be
enslaved? You are master of my carcass; take it.</p>
<p>"So that, when you come into my presence, you
pay no regard to me? "</p>
<p>No, but to myself; or, if you will have me recognize you also, I will do it as if you were a piece o;
furniture. This is not selfish vanity; for every animal is so constituted as to do everything for itself.
Even the sun does all for himself, and for that matter
so does even Zeus himself; but when he would be
styled the dispenser of rain and plenty, and the father
of gods and men, you see that he cannot attain these
offices and titles unless he contributes to the common
good. And he has universally so constituted the nature of every reasonable creature, that no one can
attain its own good without contributing something
for the good of all. And thus it becomes not selfish to
do everything for one's self; for do you expect that
a man should desert himself and his own concerns,
when all beings have one and the same original instinct, self-preservation? What follows then? That
where we recognize those absurd convictions, which
treat things outward as if they were the true good or
evil of life, there must necessarily be a regard paid to
tyrants; and I wish it were to tyrants only, and not
to the very officers of their bed-chamber too. For
how wise a man grows on a sudden, when Caesar has
made him his flunkey? How immediately we say,
" Felicio talked very sensibly to me ! " I wish he were
<pb id="p.1069"/>
turned out of office, that he might once more appear
to you the fool he is.</p>
<p>Epaphroditus owned a shoemaker, whom, because
he was good for nothing, he sold. This very fellow
being, by some strange luck, bought by a courtier,
became shoemaker to Caesar. Then, you might have
seen how Epaphroditus honored him. " How is good
Felicio, pray? "  And, if any one of us asked what the
great man himself was about, it was answered, " He is
consulting about affairs with Felicio." Did he not
sell him previously as good for nothing? Who, then,
has all on a sudden made a wise man of him? This
it is to reverence externals.</p>
<p>Is any one exalted to the office of tribune? All
who meet him congratulate him. One kisses his
eyes, another his neck, and the slaves his hands. He
goes to his house; finds it illuminated. He ascends
the capitol; offers a sacrifice. Now, who ever offered
a sacrifice for having good desires; for conforming
his aims to nature? Yet we thank the gods for that
wherein we place our good.</p>
<p>A person was talking with me to-day about applying for the priesthood in the temple of Augustus. I
said to him, Let the thing alone, friend; you will be
at great expense for nothing. "But my name," said
he, "will be written in the annals."  Will you stand
by, then, and tell those who read them, "I am the
person whose name is written there"?  And even if
you could tell every one so now, what will you do
<pb id="p.1070"/>
when you are dead? " My name will remain." Write
it upon a stone, and it will remain just as well. And,
pray, what remembrance will there be of you out of
<placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName>? "But I shall wear a crown of gold."
If your heart is quite set upon a crown, make and
put on one of roses; for it will make the prettier
appearance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<head>In what manner reason contemplates itself.</head>
<p>Every art, and every faculty, contemplates certain things as its principal objects. Whenever,
therefore, it is of the same nature with the objects of
its contemplation, it necessarily contemplates itself
too; but where it is of a different nature, it cannot
contemplate itself. The art of shoemaking, for instance, is exercised upon leather, but is itself entirely
distinct from the materials it works upon; therefore
it does not contemplate itself. Again, grammar is
exercised on articulate speech. Is the art of grammar itself, then, articulate speech? By no means.
Therefore, it cannot contemplate itself. To what purpose, then, is reason appointed by nature? To a
proper use of the phenomena of existence. And
what is reason? The art of systematizing these phenomena. Thus, by its nature, it becomes contemplative of itself too.
<pb id="p.1071"/></p>
<p>Again, what subjects of contemplation belong to
prudence? Good and evil, and that which is indifferent. What, then, is prudence itself? Good. What
imprudence?  Evil.</p>
<p>You see, then, that it necessarily contemplates both
itself and its contrary. Therefore, the first and greatest work of a philosopher is to try to distinguish
the phenomena of existence, and to admit none untried. Even in money, where our interest seems to
be concerned, you see what an art we have invented,
and how many ways an assayer uses to try its value, -
by the sight, the touch, the smell, and, lastly, the hearing. He throws the piece down, and attends to the
jingle; and is not contented with its jingling only
once, but, by frequent attention to it, trains his ear
for sound. So, when we think it of consequence
whether we are deceived or not, we use the utmost
attention to discern those things which may deceive
us. But, yawning and slumbering over our poor neglected reason, we are imposed upon by every appearance, nor know the mischief done. Would you know,
then, how very languidly you are affected by good and
evil, and how vehemently by things indifferent, consider how you feel with regard to bodily blindness,
and how with regard to being deceived; and you
will find that you are far from being moved, as you
ought, in relation to good and evil.</p>
<p>" But trained powers and much labor and learning
are here needed."
<pb id="p.1072"/></p>
<p>What then? Do you expect the greatest of arts to
be acquired by slight endeavors? And yet the principal doctrine of the philosophers is in itself short.
If you have a mind to know it, read <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, and you
will see. It is not a long story to say, "Our end is to
serve the gods," and " The essence of good consists in
the proper use of the phenomena of existence." If
you say, what then is God; what are phenomena;
what is particular, what universal nature, - here the
long story comes in. And so, if Epicurus should
come and say that good lies in the body, here, too,
it will be a long story; and it will be necessary to hear
what is the principal, and substantial, and essential
part in us. It is unlikely that the good of a snail
should be placed in the shell; and is it likely that
the good of a man should?  You yourself, Epicurus,
have in you something superior to this. What is that
in you which deliberates, which examines, which recognizes the body as the principal part?  Why light
your lamp, and labor for us, and write so many books?
That we may not be ignorant of the truth?  But what
are we? What are we to you? Thus the doctrine
becomes a long story.

<head>Of the desire of admiration.</head>
<p>When one maintains his proper attitude in life,
he does not long after externals.  What
would you have, O man?</p>
<p>" I am contented, if my desires and aversions are
conformable to nature; if I seek and shun that which
I ought, and thus regulate my purposes, my efforts,

<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Of general principles.</head>
<p>The same general principles are common to all
men, nor does one such principle contradict another; for which of us does not admit that good is
<pb id="p.1074"/>
advantageous and eligible, and in all cases to be pursued and followed?  Who does not admit that justice
is fair and becoming?  Where, then, arises the dispute?  In adapting these principles to particular
cases; as when one cries, "Such a person has acted
well, - he is a gallant man;" and another, " No, he
has acted like a fool." Hence arise disputes among
men. This is the dispute between Jews and Syrians
and Egyptians and Romans, - not whether the right
be preferable to all things, and in every instance to
be sought; but whether the eating swine's flesh be
consistent with right, or not. This, too, you will
find to have been the dispute between Achilles and
Agamemnon; for call them forth. What say you,
Agamemnon, -ought not that to be done which is
fit and right? "Yes, surely."  Achilles, what say
you, -is it not agreeable to you, that what is right
should be done? "Yes; I desire it beyond everything." Apply your principles then. Here begins
the dispute. One says, "It is not fit that I should
restore Chryseis to her father." The other says, "Yes;
but it is." One or the other of them, certainly,
makes a wrong conception of the principle of fitness.
Again, the one says, " If it be fit that I should give up
Chryseis, it is fit, too, that I should take some of your
prizes."  The other answers, "What, that you should
take my mistress?"  "Ay; yours."   "What, mine
only? Must I only, then, lose my prize?"</p>
<p>What, then, is it to be properly educated? To
<pb id="p.1075"/>
learn how to apply the principles of natural right to
particular cases, and, for the rest, to distinguish that
some things are in our power, while others are not.
In our own power are the will, and all voluntary
actions; out of our power, the body and its parts,
property, parents, brothers, children, country, and, in
short, all our fellow-beings. Where, then, shall we
place good? In what shall we define it to consist?
In things within our own power.   "But are not
health and strength and life good? And are not
children, parents, country? You talk unreasonably."</p>
<p>Let us, then, try another point of view. Can he
who suffers evil, and is disappointed of good, be
happy? He cannot. And can he preserve a right
behavior with regard to society? How is it possible
that he should?  I am  naturally led to seek my
own highest good. If, therefore, it is my highest
good to have an estate, it is for my good likewise to
take it away from my neighbor. If it is my highest
good to have a suit of clothes, it is for my good likewise to steal it wherever I find it. Hence wars, seditions, tyranny, unjust invasions. How shall I, if this
be the case, be able any longer to do my duty
towards Zeus? If I suffer evil, and am disappointed,
he takes no care of me. And what is he to me if he
cannot help me; or. again, what is he to me if he
chooses I should be in the condition that I am?
Then I begin to hate him. What, then, do we build
temples, do we raise statues, to Zeus. as to evil
<pb id="p.1076"/>
demons, as to the goddess Fever? How, then, is he
the preserver, and how the dispenser of rain and
plenty? If we place the essence of good on any such
ground, all this will follow. What, then, shall we do?</p>
<p>This is the inquiry which interests him who philosophizes in earnest, and to some result. Do I not now
see what is good, and what is evil, or am I mad?
Suppose I place good only in things dependent on my
own will?  Why, every one will laugh at me. Some
gray-headed old fellow will come, with his fingers covered with gold rings, and will shake his head, and say,
"Hark ye, child, it is fit you should learn philosophy;
but it is fit, too, you should have common-sense. All
this is nonsense. You learn syllogisms from philosophers; but how you are to act, you know better than
they." Then what displeases you if I do know?
What can I say to this unfortunate? If I make no
answer, he will burst; so I must answer thus: "Bear
with me, as with lovers. Granted; I am not myself.
I have lost my senses."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Against Epicurus.</head>
<p>Even Epicurus is sensible that we are by nature
sociable beings; but having once placed our
good in the mere outward shell, he can say nothing
<pb id="p.1077"/>
afterwards inconsistent with that; for again, he strenuously maintains that we ought not to admire or accept
anything separated from the nature of good, and he is
in the right to maintain it. But how, then, arise any
affectionate anxieties, unless there be such a thing as
natural affection towards our offspring? Then why
do you, Epicurus, dissuade a wise man from bringing
up children? Why are you afraid that upon their
account he may fall into anxieties? Does he fall into
any for a mouse, that feeds within his house? What
is it to him, if a little mouse bewails itself there?  But
Epicurus knew that, if once a child is born, it is no
longer in our power not to love and be solicitous for
it. On the same grounds he says that a wise man
will not engage himself in public business, knowing
very well what must follow. If men are only so many
flies, why should he not engage in it?</p>
<p>And does he, who knows all this, dare to forbid us
to bring up children? Not even a sheep, or a wolf,
deserts its offspring; and shall man? What would
you have,  that we should be as silly as sheep?
Yet even these do not desert their offspring. Or as
savage as wolves? Neither do these desert them.
Pray, who would mind <emph>you</emph>, if he saw his child fallen
upon the ground and crying? For my part, I am of
opinion that your father and another, even if they
could have foreseen that you would have been the
author of such doctrines, would not have thrown you
away.

<head>How we ought to struggle with difficulties.</head>
<p>Difficulties are things that show what men

pitted you against a rough antagonist. For what end?
That you may be an Olympic conqueror; and this
cannot be without toil. No man, in my opinion, has
a more profitable difficulty on his hands than you
have, provided you will but use it, as an athletic
champion uses his antagonist.</p>
<p>Suppose we were to send you as a scout to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
But no one ever sends a timorous scout, who, when
he only hears a noise, or sees a shadow, runs back
frightened, and says, "The enemy is at hand."  So
now, if you should come and tell us, "Things are in
a fearful way at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; death is terrible, banishment
terrible, calumny terrible, poverty terrible; run, good
people, the enemy is at hand;" we will answer, Get
you gone, and prophesy for yourself; our only fault
is that we have sent such a scout. Diogenes was sent
as a scout before you, but he told us other tidings.
He says that death is no evil, for it is nothing base;
that calumny is only the noise of madmen. And
what account did this spy give us of pain, of pleasure,
<pb id="p.1079"/>
of poverty? He says that to be naked is better than
a purple robe; to sleep upon the bare ground, the
softest bed; and gives a proof of all he says by his
own courage, tranquillity, and freedom, and, moreover, by a healthy and robust body. "There is no
enemy near," he says; " all is profound peace." How
so, Diogenes? "Look upon me," he says. "Am I
hurt? Am I wounded?   Have I run away from any
one? "  This is a scout worth having. But you come,
and tell us one tale after another. Go back and look
more carefully, and without fear.</p>
<p>"What shall I do, then?"</p>
<p>What do you do when you land from a ship? Do
you take away with you the rudder, or the oars?
What do you take, then? Your own, your bundle
and your flask. So, in the present case, if you will
but remember what is your own, you will not covet
what belongs to others. If some tyrant bids you put
off your consular robe, -" Well, I am in my equestrian robe." Put off that too. " I have only my coat."
Put off that too. "Well, I am naked."  I am not
yet satisfied. " Then e'en take my whole body. If I
can throw off a paltry body, am I any longer afraid of
a tyrant? "</p>
<p>"But such a one will not leave me his heir."
What, then, have I forgotten, that such possessions are
never really mine? How, then, do we call them
ours? It is as with a bed in an inn. If the landlord,
when he dies. leaves you the bed. well and good; but
<pb id="p.1080"/>
if to another, it will be his, and you will seek one elsewhere; and consequently, if you do not find one,
you will sleep upon the ground; only sleep fearlessly
and profoundly, and remember that tragedies find
their theme among the rich and kings and tyrants.
No poor man fills any other place in one than as
part of the chorus; whereas, kings begin indeed with
prosperity: " Crown the palace;" but continue about
the third and fourth act: "Alas, Citheron! why
didst thou receive me ! "<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Soph. OT 1391">Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannus, 1391.</bibl> - H.</note>  Where are thy crowns,
wretch; where is thy diadem? Cannot thy guards
help thee?</p>
<p>Whenever you are brought into any such society,
think then that you meet a tragic actor, or, rather,
not an actor, but Oedipus himself. "But such a one
is happy; he walks with a numerous train." Well, I
too walk with a numerous train.</p>
<p>But remember the principal thing, -that the door
is open. Do not be more fearful than children; but
as they, when the play dues not please them, say, " I
will play no longer," so do you, in the same case,
say, "I will play no longer," and go; but, if you
stay, do not complain.

guard what is your own; what belongs to others do
not covet. Honesty is your own; a sense of virtuous
shame is your own. Who, then, can deprive you of
these? Who can restrain you from making use of
them, but yourself? And how do you do it? When
you make that your concern which is not truly your
own, you lose that which is." Having such precepts
and directions from Zeus, what sort do you still want
from me? Am I better than He, or more worthy of
credit? If you observe these precepts, what others
<pb id="p.1082"/>

you mix the wine; you sing: you go; you come."  I
obey, that the game may not be broken up by my
fault.</p>
<p>[Then he orders] "I bid you think yourself to be
unhappy." I do not think so; and who shall compel
me to think so?</p>
<p>Again, suppose we agree to play Agamemnon and
Achilles. He who is appointed for Agamemnon says
to me, " Go to Achilles, and force away Briseis." I
go. "Come." I come. We should deal with life
as with these imaginary orders.</p>
<p>"Suppose it to be night."  Well, suppose it. "Is
it day then?" No; for I admitted the hypothesis,
that it was night. "Suppose that you think it to be
night."  Well, suppose it. "But you must really
think that it is night." That by no means follows
from the hypothesis. Thus it is in the case illustrated.
Suppose you have ill luck?  Suppose it. "Are you
then unlucky?"  Yes. "Are you thoroughly unfor-
<pb id="p.1083"/>
tunate?"  Yes. "Well; but you must really regard
yourself as miserable." But this is no part of the assumption, and there is a power who forbids me [to
admit that].</p>
<p>How far, then, are we to carry such analogies? As
far as is useful; that is, till we go farther than is reasonable and fit.</p>
<p>Moreover, some are peevish and fastidious, and say,
I cannot dine with such a fellow, to be obliged to
hear him all day recounting how he fought in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>.
"I told you, my friend, how I gained the eminence."
There I begin to suffer another siege. But another
says, " I had rather get a dinner, and hear him prate
as much as he pleases."</p>
<p>Do you decide between these opinions; but do not
let it be with depression and anxiety, and the assumption that you are miserable, for no one compels you
to that. Is there smoke in my house?  If it be moderate, I will stay; if very great, I will go out. For
you must always remember, and hold to this, that the
door is open. "You are forbidden to live at <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName>." Then I will not live there. " Nor at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>."
Well, nor at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. " Nor at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>." Nor at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
"But you shall live at Gyaros."<note anchored="yes">An island in the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean Sea</placeName>, to which the Romans used to banish criminals. -C.</note> I will live there.
But suppose that living at Gyaros seems to me like
living in a great smoke. I can then retire where no
one can forbid me to live, for it is an abode open to
<pb id="p.1084"/>
all, and put off my last garment, this poor body of
mine; beyond this, no one has any power over me.</p>
<p>Thus Demetrius said to <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>: "You sentence me
to death; and Nature you." If I prize my body first,
I have surrendered myself as a slave; if my estate,
the same; for I at once betray where I am vulnerable. Just as when a reptile pulls in his head, I bid
you strike that part of him which he guards; and be
you assured, that wherever you show a desire to guard
yourself. there your master will attack you. Remember but this, and whom will you any longer flatter or
fear?</p>
<p>"But I want to sit where the senators do."</p>
<p>Do not you see, that by this you incommode and
torment yourself?</p>
<p>"Why, how else shall I see the show in the Amphitheatre advantageously? "</p>
<p>Do not insist on seeing it, O man ! and you will
not be incommoded. Why do you vex yourself?
Or wait a little while; and when the show is over, go
sit in the senators' places and sun yourself. For remember, that this holds universally, - we incommode
and torment ourselves; that is, our own preconceived
notions do it for us. What is it to be reviled, for
instance? Stand by a stone and revile it, and what
will you get by it? If you, therefore, would listen
only as a stone, what would your reviler gain? But
if the reviler has the weakness of the reviled for a
vantage-ground, then he carries his point.

<p>"Strip him" [bids the tyrant]. What mean you
by <emph>him</emph>?  Take my clothes, strip them, at your pleasure. "I meant only to insult you."  Much good
may it do you.</p>
<p>These things were the study of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>; and by
these means he always preserved the same countenance. Yet we had rather exercise and study anything, than how to become unrestrained and free.
" But the philosophers talk paradoxes." And are
there not paradoxes in other arts? What is more
paradoxical than to prick any one's eye, that he may
see?  Should one tell this to one ignorant of surgery,
would not he laugh at him? What wonder then, if
in philosophy also many truths appear paradoxes to
the ignorant?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<head>What the rule of life is.</head>
<p>S some one was reading hypothetical propositions, Epictetus remarked that it was a rule in
these to admit whatever was in accordance with the
hypothesis, but much more a rule in life to do what
was in accordance with nature. For, if we desire in
every matter and on every occasion to conform to nature, we must on every occasion evidently make it
our aim, neither to omit anything thus conformabley
<pb id="p.1086"/>
nor to admit anything inconsistent. Philosophers,
therefore, first exercise us in theory, which is the
more easy task, and then lead us to the more difficult; for in theory there is nothing to hinder our following what we are taught, but in life there are many
things to draw us aside. It is ridiculous, then, to say
we must begin with these applications, for it is not
easy to begin with the most difficult; and this excuse
children should make to those parents who dislike
that they should study philosophy. " Am I to blame
then, sir, and ignorant of my duty, and of what is
incumbent on me? If this is neither to be learned,
nor taught, why do you find fault with me? If it
is to be taught, pray teach me yourself; or, if you
cannot, let me learn it from those who profess to
understand it. For what think you; that I voluntarily fall into evil, and miss good? Heaven forbid !
What, then, is the cause of my faults? Ignorance.
Are you not willing, then, that I should get rid of
my ignorance?   Who was ever taught the art of
music, or navigation, by anger?  Do you expect,
then, that your anger should teach me the art of
living? "</p>
<p>This, however, can properly be said only by one
who is really in earnest. But he who reads these
things, and applies to the philosophers, merely for the
sake of showing, at some entertainment, that he
understands hypothetical reasonings, what aim has
he but to be admired by some senator, who happens
<pb id="p.1087"/>
to sit near him? <note anchored="yes">This passage is omitted as inexplicable by Mrs. Carter. Schweighaeuser says, <quote lang="la">Tentare interpretationem  possum; praestare non possum.</quote> A passage just below I also have omitted, as the text is admitted to be in a hopeless state.- H.</note>  Great possessions may be won by
such aims as that, but what we hold as wealth passes
there for folly. It is hard, therefore, to overcome by
appearances, where vain things thus pass for great.</p>
<p>I once saw a person weeping and embracing the
Knees of Epaphroditus, and deploring his hard fortune, that he had not more than 150,000 drachmae
left. What said Epaphroditus then? Did he laugh
at him, as we should do? No; but cried out with
astonishment: " Poor man! How could you be silent
under it?  How could you bear it?  "</p>
<p>The first step, therefore, towards becoming a philosopher is to be sensible in what state the ruling
faculty of the mind is; for on knowing it to be weak,
no person will immediately employ it in great attempts. But, for want of this, some who can scarce
digest a crumb will yet buy and swallow whole treatises; and so they throw them up again, or cannot digest them; and then come colics, fluxes, and fevers.
Such persons ought to consider what they can bear.
Indeed, it is easy to convince an ignorant person, so
far as concerns theory; but in matters relating to life,
no one offers himself to conviction, and we hate those
who have convinced us. <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> used to say, that
we ought not to live a life unexamined.<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Apol. 38a">Plato, Apologia, i. 28.</bibl> - H.</note>
<pb id="p.1088"/></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<head>Of the varied appearances of things to the mind, and what means are at hand by which to regulate them.</head>
<p>Appearances to the mind are of four kinds.</p>
<p>Things either are what they appear to be; or
they neither are, nor appear to be; or they are, and
do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear
to be. Rightly to aim, in all these cases, is the wise
man's task. Whatever unduly constrains us, to that
a remedy must be applied. If the sophistries of
Pyrrhonism, or the Academy, constrain us, the remedy
must be applied there; if specious appearances, by
which things seem to be good which are not so, let us
seek for a remedy there. If it be custom which constrains us, we must endeavor to find a remedy against
that.</p>
<p>"What remedy is to be found against custom? "</p>
<p>Establish a contrary custom. You hear the vulgar
say, "Such a one, poor soul! is dead."  Well, his
father died; his mother died. " Ay, but he was cut off
in the flower of his age, and in a foreign land." Observe these contrary ways of speaking; and abandon
such expressions. Oppose to one custom a contrary
<pb id="p.1089"/>
custom; to sophistry the art of reasoning, and the
frequent use and exercise of it. Against specious appearances we must set clear convictions, bright and
ready for use. When death appears as an evil, we
ought immediately to remember that evils are things
to be avoided, but death is inevitable. For what can
I do, or where can I fly from it? Let me suppose
myself to be Sarpedon, the son of Jove, that I may
speak as nobly.  " I go either to excel, or to give another the occasion
to excel."<note anchored="yes">Imitated from <bibl n="Hom. Il. 12.328"><placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName>, 12. 328</bibl>.- H.</note>  If I can achieve nothing
myself, I will not grudge another his achievement.</p>
<p>But suppose this to be a strain too high for us; do
not these following thoughts befit us? Whither shall
I fly from death? Show me the place, show me the
people, to whom I may have recourse, whom death
does not overtake. Show me the charm to avoid it.
If there be none, what would you have me do? I
cannot escape death; but cannot I escape the dread
of it? Must I die trembling and lamenting?  For
the very origin of the disease lies in wishing for something that is not obtained.  Under the influence of
this, if I can make outward things conform to my
own inclination, I do it; if not, I feel inclined to tear
out the eyes of whoever hinders me. For it is the
nature of man not to endure the being deprived of
good; not to endure the falling into evil. And so,
at last, when I can neither control events, nor tear
out the eyes of him who hinders me, I sit down, and
<pb id="p.1090"/>
groan, and revile him whom I can, - Zeus, and the
rest of the gods; for what are they to me, if they
take no care of me?</p>
<p>"Oh ! but then you will be impious."</p>
<p>What then? Can I be in a worse condition than I
am now? In general, remember this, that unless we
make our religion and our treasure to consist in the
same thing, religion will always be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Have these things no weight? Let a Pyrrhonist,
or an Academic, come and oppose them. For my
part, I have neither leisure nor ability to stand up as
an advocate for common-sense. Even if the business
were concerning an estate, I should call in another
advocate. To what advocate, then, shall I now appeal? I will leave it to any one who may be upon
the spot. Thus, I may not be able to explain how
sensation takes place, whether it be diffused universally, or reside in a particular part; for I find perplexities in either case; but that you and I are not
the same person, I very exactly know.</p>
<p>"How so? "</p>
<p>Why, I never, when I have a mind to swallow anything, carry it to your mouth, but my own. I never,
when I wanted bread, seized a broom instead, but
went directly to the bread as I needed it. You who
deny all evidence of the senses, do you act otherwise?
Which of you, when he wished to go into a bath, ever
went into a mill?</p>
<p>"Why, then, must not we, to the utmost, defend
<pb id="p.1091"/>
these points; stand by common-sense; be fortified
against everything that opposes it? "</p>
<p>Who denies that? But it must be done by him
who has ability and leisure to spare; but he who is
full of trembling and perturbation and inward disorders of heart must first employ his time about something else.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<head>That we ought not to be angry with mankind. What things are little, what great, among men.</head>
<p>What is the basis of assent to anything?  Its
appearing to be true. It is not possible,
therefore, to assent to what appears to be not true.
Why? Because it is the very nature of the understanding to agree to truth, to be dissatisfied with falsehood, and to suspend its belief in doubtful cases.</p>
<p>"What is the proof of this? "</p>
<p>Persuade yourself, if you can, that it is now night.
Impossible. Dissuade yourself from the belief that it</p>
<p>1 This seems to be said by one of the hearers, who wanted to
have the absurdities of the sceptics confuted and guarded
against by regular argument. Epictetus allows this to be right,
for such as have abilities and leisure; but recommends in others
the more necessary task of curing their own moral disorders,
and insinuates that the mere common occurences of life are sufficient to overthrow the notions of the Pyrrhonists. - C.
<pb id="p.1092"/>
is day. Impossible. Persuade yourself that the number of the stars is even or odd. Impossible.</p>
<p>When any one, then, assents to what is false, be
assured that he does not wilfully assent to it as false, -
for, as Plato affirms, the soul is unwillingly deprived
of truth,<note anchored="yes">This is not a literal quotation from Plato, but similar passages are to be found in his Laws, 9. 5; Sophist, 29; Protagoras, 87, etc. - H.</note> - but what is false appears to him to be true.
Well, then; have we, in actions, anything correspondent to this distinction between true and false? There
are right and wrong; advantageous and disadvantageous; desirable and undesirable, and the like.</p>
<p>"A person, then, cannot think a thing truly advantageous to him, and not choose it?"</p>
<p>He cannot. But how says Medea?--
<cit><quote><l>I know what evils wait upon my purpose;</l>
<l>But wrath is stronger than this will of mine.</l></quote> <bibl n="Eur. Med. 1087">Euripides, Medea, 1087. - H.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Was it that she thought the very indulgence of her
rage, and the punishing her husband, more advantageous than the preservation of her children? Yes;
but she is deceived. Show clearly to her that she is
deceived, and she will forbear; but, till you have
shown it, what has she to follow but what appears to
herself?  Nothing.</p>
<p>Why, then, are you angry with her, that the unhappy woman is deceived in the most important
<pb id="p.1093"/>
points, and instead of a human creature, becomes a
viper? Why do you not rather, as we pity the blind
and lame, so likewise pity those who are blinded .and
lamed in their superior faculties? Whoever, therefore, duly remembers, that the appearance of things
to the mind is the standard of every action to man,
-that this is either right or wrong, and if right, he
is without fault; if wrong, he himself suffers punishment; for that one man cannot be the person
deceived, and another the only sufferer, - such a
person will not be outrageous and angry at any one;
will not revile, or reproach, or hate, or quarrel with
any one.</p>
<p>"So, then, have all the great and dreadful deeds
that have been done in the world no other origin
than semblances?"</p>
<p>Absolutely no other. The Iliad consists of nothing but such semblances and their results. It seemed
to <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> that he should carry off the wife of Menelaus.
It seemed to Helen that she should follow him. If,
then, it had seemed to Menelaus that it was an advantage to be robbed of such a wife, what could have
happened? Not only the <placeName key="tgn,2061426">Iliad</placeName> had been lost, but
the Odyssey too.</p>
<p>"Do such great events, then, depend on so small a
cause? "</p>
<p>What events, then, call you great?</p>
<p>"Wars and seditions, the destruction of numbers
of men, and the overthrow of cities."
<pb id="p.1094"/></p>
<p>And what in all this is great? Nothing. What is
great in the death of numbers of oxen, numbers of
sheep, or in the burning or pulling down numbers of
nests of storks or swallows?</p>
<p>"Are these things then similar?"</p>
<p>They are. The bodies of men are destroyed, and
the bodies of sheep and oxen. The houses of men
are burnt, and the nests of storks. What is there so
great or fearful in all this? Pray, show me what
difference there is between the house of a man and
the nest of a stork, considered as a habitation, except
that houses are built with beams and tiles and
bricks, and nests with sticks and clay?</p>
<p>"What, then; are a stork and a man similar?
What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Similar in body.</p>
<p>"Is there no difference, then, between a man and
a stork?"</p>
<p>Yes, surely; but not in these things.
"In what, then? "</p>
<p>Inquire; and you will find, that the difference lies
in something else. See whether it be not in rationality of action, in social instincts, fidelity, honor,
providence, judgment.</p>
<p>" Where, then, is the real good or evil of man? "</p>
<p>Just where this difference lies. If this distinguishing trait is preserved, and remains well fortified, and
neither honor, fidelity, nor judgment is destroyed,
then he himself is likewise saved; but when any one
<pb id="p.1095"/>
of these is lost or demolished, he himself is lost also.
In this do all great events consist. <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, they say,
was undone, because the Greeks invaded <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, and
laid it waste, and his family were slain in battle. By
no means; for no one is undone by an action not his
own. All that was only like laying waste the nests
of storks. But his true undoing was when he lost
modesty, faith, honor, virtue. When was Achilles
undone, - when Patroclus died?   By no means.
But when he gave himself up to rage; when he wept
over a girl; when he forgot that he came there, not
to win mistresses, but to fight. This is human undoing; this is the siege, this the overthrow, when right
principles are ruined and destroyed.</p>
<p>"But when wives and children are led away captives, and the men themselves killed, are not these
evils?"</p>
<p>Whence do you conclude them such? Pray inform me, in my turn.</p>
<p>" Nay; but whence do you affirm that they are not
evils? "</p>
<p>Recur to the rules. Apply your principles. One
cannot sufficiently wonder at what happens among
men. When we would judge of light and heavy, we
do not judge by guess, nor when we judge of straight
and crooked; and, in general, when it concerns us
to know the truth on any special point, no one of us
will do anything by guess. But where the first and
principal source of right or wrong action is con-
<pb id="p.1096"/>
cerned, of being prosperous or unprosperous, happy
or unhappy,-there only do we act rashly, and by
guess. Nowhere anything like a balance; nowhere
anything like a rule; but something seems thus or
so to me, and I at once act accordingly. For am I
better than Agamemnon or Achilles; that they, by
following what seemed best to them, should do and
suffer so many things, and yet that seeming should
not suffice me? And what tragedy hath any other
origin? The Atreus of Euripides, what is it? Seeming. The Oedipus of Sophocles?  Seeming.  The
Phoenix?  The Hippolytus?   All seeming.  Who
then, think you, can escape this influence? What
are they called who follow every seeming? Madmen.
Yet do we, then, behave otherwise?</p></div2>

a good state; but perverse and distorted principles,
in a bad one. This law hath God ordained, who
says, "If you wish for good, receive it from yourself."
You say, No; but from another. "Nay; but from
yourself."</p>
<p>Accordingly, when a tyrant threatens, and sends for
me, I say, Against what is your threatening pointed?
If he says, "I will chain you," I answer, It is my
hands and feet that you threaten. If he says, "I
will cut off your head," I answer, It is my head
that you threaten. If he says, "I will throw you
into prison," I answer, It is the whole of this paltry
body that you threaten; and if he threatens banishment, just the same.</p>
<p>" Does he not threaten <emph>you</emph>, then? "</p>
<p>If I am persuaded that these things are nothing to
me, he does not; but if I fear any of them, it is me
that he threatens. Who is it, after all, that I fear?
The master of what? Of things in my own power?
Of these no one is the master. Of things not in my
power? And what are these to me?</p>
<p>" What, then ! do you philosophers teach us a contempt of kings? "</p>
<p>By no means. Which of us teaches any one to
contend with them about things of which they have
the command? Take my body; take my possessions; take my reputation; take away even my
friends. If I persuade any one to claim these things
as his own, you may justly accuse me. "Ay; but I
<pb id="p.1098"/>
would command your principles too." And who hath
given you that power? How can you conquer the
principle of another? "By applying terror, I will
conquer it." Do not you see that what conquers
itself .is not conquered by another? And nothing
but itself can conquer the will. Hence, too, the most
excellent and equitable law of God, that the better
should always prevail over the worse. Ten are better
than one.</p>
<p>" For what purpose? "</p>
<p>For chaining, killing, dragging where they please;
for taking away an estate. Thus ten conquer one,
in the cases wherein they are better.</p>
<p>" In what, then, are they worse? "</p>
<p>When the one has right principles, and the others
have not. For can they conquer in this case?  How
should they? If we were weighed in a scale, must
not the heavier outweigh?</p>
<p>"How then came <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> to suffer such things
from the Athenians?"</p>
<p>O foolish man ! what mean you by <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>? Express the fact as it is. Are you surprised that the
mere body of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> should be carried away, and
dragged to prison, by such as were stronger; that it
should be poisoned by hemlock and die? Do these
things appear wonderful to you; these things unjust? Is it for such things as these that you accuse
God?   Had <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, then, no compensation for
them? In what, then, to him, did the essence of
<pb id="p.1099"/>
good consist? Whom shall we regard, you or him?
And what says he? "Anytus and Melitus may indeed kill; but hurt me they cannot." And again,
"If it so pleases God, so let it be."</p>
<p>But show me that he who has the worse principles
can get the advantage over him who has the better.
You never will show it, nor anything like it; for the
Law of Nature and of God is this,--let the better
always prevail over the worse.</p>
<p>"In what?"</p>
<p>In that wherein it is better. One body may be
stronger than another; many, than one; and a thief,
than one who is not a thief. Thus I, for instance,
lost my lamp, because the thief was better at keeping awake than I. But for that lamp he paid the
price of becoming a thief; for that lamp he lost his
virtue and became like a wild beast. This seemed to
him a good bargain; and so let it be !</p>
<p>But some one takes me by the collar, and drags me
to the forum; and then all the rest cry out, "Philosopher, what good do your principles do you? See,
you are being dragged to prison; see, you are going
to lose your head-! " And, pray, what rule of philosophy could I contrive, that when a stronger than myself lays hold on my collar, I should not be dragged;
or that, when ten men pull me at once, and throw
me into prison, I should not be thrown there? But
have I learned nothing, then? I have learned to
know, whatever happens, that if it concerns not my
<pb id="p.1100"/>
will, it is nothing to me. Have my principles, then,
done me no good? What then; do I seek for anything else to do me good, but what I have learned?
Afterwards, as I sit in prison, I say, He who has
made all this disturbance neither recognizes any
guidance, nor heeds any teaching, nor is it any concern to him to know what philosophers say or do.
Let him alone.</p>
<p>" Come forth again from prison." If you have no
further need for me in prison, I will come out; if you
want me again, I will return. "For how long?"
Just so long as reason requires I should continue in
this body; when that is over, take it, and fare ye
well. Only let us not act inconsiderately, nor from
cowardice, nor on slight grounds, since that would be
contrary to the will of God; for he hath need of such
a world, and such beings to live on earth. But, if
he sounds a retreat, as he did to Socrates, we are to
obey him when he sounds it, as our General.</p>
<p>"Well; but can these things be explained to the
multitude?  "</p>
<p>To what purpose? Is it not sufficient to be convinced one's self?  When children come to us clapping their hands, and saying, "To-morrow is the
good feast of <placeName key="tgn,2644983">Saturn</placeName>;" do we tell them that good
doth not consist in such things? By no means; but
we clap our hands also. Thus, when you are unable
to convince any one, consider hint as a child, and clap
your hands with him; or, ii you will not do that, at
<pb id="p.1101"/>
least hold your tongue. These things we ought to
remember; and when we are called to any trial, to
know that an opportunity is come of showing whether
we have been well taught. For he who goes from
a philosophical lecture to a difficult point of practice
is like a young man who has been studying to solve
syllogisms. If you propose an easy one, he says,
" Give me rather a fine intricate one, that I may try
my strength."  Thus athletic champions are displeased with a slight antagonist. "He cannot lift
me," says one. Is this a youth of spirit?  No; for
when the occasion calls upon him, he may begin crying, and say, "I wanted to learn a little longer first."
Learn what? If you did not learn these things to
show them in practice, why did you learn them?</p>
<p>I trust there must be some one among you, sitting
here, who feels secret pangs of impatience, and says,
" When will such a trial come to my share, as hath
now fallen to his? Must I sit wasting my life in a
corner, when I might be crowned at <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>? When
will any one bring the news of such a combat for
me?"   Such should be the disposition of you all.
Even among the gladiators of Caesar, there are some
who bear it very ill that they are not brought upon
the stage and matched; and who offer vows to God,
and address the officers, begging to fight. And will
none among you appear such? I would willingly
take a voyage on purpose to see how a champion of
mine acts; how he meets his occasion.
<pb id="p.1102"/></p>
<p>This is not the contest I would choose, say you.
Is it in your power, then, to make the selection?
Such a body is given you, such parents, such brothers,
such a country, and such a rank in it; and then you
come to me, to change the conditions! Have
you not abilities to manage that which is given you
You should say to me, " It is your business to propose; mine, to treat the subject well." No; but
you say, "Do not meet me with such a perplexity,
but such a one; do not offer such an obstacle to me,
but such a one."  There will be a time, I suppose,
when tragedians will fancy themselves to be mere
masks, and buskins, and long train. These things
are your materials, man, and your stage-properties.
Speak something; that we may know whether you
are a tragedian or a buffoon; for both have all the
rest in common. Suppose any one should take away
his buskins and his mask, and bring him upon the
stage in his common dress, is the tragedian lost, or
does he remain? If he has a voice, he remains.
"Here, this instant, take upon you the command."
I take it; and taking it, I show how a skilful man
performs the part. "Now lay aside your robe; put
on rags, and come upon the stage in that character."
What then? Is it not in my power to express the
character by a suitable voice?</p>
<p>"In what character do you now appear?"  As a
witness summoned by God. "Come you, then, and
bear witness for me; for you are a fit witness to be
<pb id="p.1103"/>
produced by me. Is anything which is inevitable to
be classed as either good or evil?  Do I hurt any
one? Have I made the good of each individual to
rest on any one but himself?  What evidence do
you give for God?"</p>
<p>" I am in a miserable condition, O Lord; I am undone: no mortal cares for me; no mortal gives me
anything; all blame me; all speak ill of me."</p>
<p>Is this the evidence you are to give? And will
you bring disgrace upon his summons, who hath conferred such an honor upon you, and thought you
worthy of being produced as a witness in such a
cause?</p>
<p>But some one in authority has given a sentence.
"I judge you to be impious and profane."  What
has befallen you?  - I have been judged to be impious and profane. - Anything else?- Nothing.--
Suppose he had passed his judgment upon any process of reasoning, and had questioned the conclusion
that, if it be day, it is light; what would have befallen the proposition? In this case, who is judged,
who is condemned, - the proposition, or he who cannot understand it? Does he know, who claims the
power of ruling in your case, what pious or impious
means? Has he made it his study or learned it?
Where? From whom? A musician would not regard him, if he pronounced bass to be treble; nor a
mathematician, if he passed sentence, that lines
drawn from the centre to the circumference are not
<pb id="p.1104"/>
equal. And shall he who is instructed in the truth
respect an ignorant man, when he pronounces upon
pious and impious, just and unjust?</p>
<p>"Oh, the persecutions to which the wise are exposed !"  Is it <emph>here</emph> that you have learned this talk?
Why do not you leave such pitiful discourse to idle,
pitiful fellows; and let them sit in a corner, and
receive some little mean pay, or grumble that nobody gives them anything? But do you come, and
make some use of what you have learned. It is not
reasonings that are wanted now, for there are books
stuffed full of stoical reasonings.</p>
<p>"What is wanted, then? "</p>
<p>The man who shall apply them; whose actions
may bear testimony to his doctrines. Assume this
character for me, that we may no longer make use in
the schools of the examples of the ancients, but may
have some examples of our own.</p>
<p>" To whom, then, does the contemplation of these
abstractions belong?"</p>
<p>To any one who has leisure for them; for man is
a being fond of contemplation. But it is shameful to
take only such view of things as truant slaves take
of a play.  We ought to sit calmly, and listen,
whether to the actor or to the musician; and not do
like those poor fellows, who come in and admire the
actor, constantly glancing about them, and then, if
any one happens to mention their master, run frightened away. It is shameful for a philosopher thus to
<pb id="p.1105"/>
contemplate the works of nature. What, in this parallel case, stands for the master? Man is not the
master of man; but death is, and life, and pleasure,
and pain; for without these, bring even Caesar to
me, and you will see how intrepid I shall be. But, if
he comes thundering and lightening with these, and
these are the objects of my terror, what do I else
but, like the truant slave, acknowledge my master?
While I have any respite from these, as the truant
comes into the theatre, so I bathe, drink, sing; but
all with terror and anxiety. But if I free myself
from my masters, that is, from such things as render
a master terrible, what trouble, what master have I
remaining?</p>
<p>" Shall we then insist upon these things with all
men? "</p>
<p>No. But make allowance for the ignorant, and
say, This poor man. advises me to what he thinks
good for himself. I excuse him; for <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, too,

for us !"  Was it to him that <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> said, " For this
reason we sent the women out of the way"? No,

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>That courage is not inconsistent with caution.</head>
<p>There is an assertion of the philosophers which
may perhaps appear a paradox to many; yet
let us fairly examine whether it be true, - that it is
possible, in all things, to act at once with caution and
courage. For caution seems, in some measure, contrary to courage; and contraries are by no means
consistent. The appearance of a paradox in the present case seems to me to arise as follows. If indeed
we assert that courage and caution are to be used in
the same instances, we might justly be accused of
uniting contradictions; but in the way that we affirm
it, where is the absurdity? For if what has been so
often said, and so often demonstrated, be certain,
that the essence of good and evil consists in the use
of things as they appear, and that things inevitable
are not to be classed either as good or evil, what
paradox do the philosophers assert, if they say,
" Where events are inevitable, meet them with courage, but otherwise with caution "? For in these last
cases only, if evil lies in a perverted will, is caution to
<pb id="p.1109"/>
be used; and if things inevitable and uncontrollable
are nothing to us, in these we are to make use of
courage. Thus we shall be at once cautious and
courageous, and, indeed, courageous on account of
this very caution; for by using caution with regard
to things really evil, we shall gain courage with
regard to what are not so.</p>
<p>But we are in the same condition with deer; when
these in a fright fly from the plumes [which hunters
wave], whither do they turn, and to what do they
retire for safety? To the nets. And thus they are
undone, by inverting the objects of fear and confidence. Thus we, too. When do we yield to fear?
About things inevitable. When, on the other hand,
do we behave with courage, as if there were nothing
to be dreaded? About things that might be controlled by will. To be deceived, then, or to act rashly
or imprudently, or to indulge a scandalous desire, we
treat as of no importance, in our effort to bring about
things which we cannot, after all, control. But where
death, or exile, or pain, or ignominy, is concerned,
then comes the retreat, the flutter, and the fright.
Hence, as it must be with those who err in matters
of the greatest importance, we turn what should be
courage into rashness, desperation, recklessness, effrontery; and what should be caution becomes timid,
base, and full of fears and perturbations. Let one
apply his spirit of caution to things within the reach
of his own will, then he will have the subject of avoid-
<pb id="p.1110"/>
ance within his own control; but if he transfers it to
that which is inevitable, trying to shun that which he
cannot control and others can, then he must needs
fear, be harassed, and be disturbed. For it is not
death or pain that is to be dreaded, but the fear of
pain or death. Hence we commend him who says:
<cit><quote><l>Death is no ill, but <emph>shamefully</emph> to die.</l></quote> <bibl>Euripides, Fragments. - H.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Courage, then, ought to be opposed to death, and
caution to <emph>the fear</emph> of death; whereas we, on the contrary, oppose to death, flight; and to these our false
convictions concerning it, recklessness, and desperation, and assumed indifference.</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> used, very properly, to call these things
masks; for as masks appear shocking and formidable
to children from their inexperience, so we are thus
affected with regard to things for no other reason.
For what constitutes a child?  Ignorance. What
constitutes a child? Want of instruction; for they
are our equals, so far as their degree of knowledge
permits. What is death? A mask. Turn it on the
other side and be convinced. See, it doth not bite.
This little body and spirit must be again, as once,
separated, either now or hereafter; why, then, are you
displeased if it be now? For if not now it will be
hereafter. Why? To fulfil the course of the universe; for that hath need of some things present,
others to come, and others already completed.
<pb id="p.1111"/></p>
<p>What is pain? A mask. Turn it and be convinced.</p>
<p>This weak flesh is sometimes affected by harsh,
sometimes by smooth impressions. If suffering be
beyond endurance, the door is open; till then, bear it.
It is fit that the final door should be open against all
accidents, since thus we escape all trouble.</p>
<p>What, then, is the fruit of these principles?  What
it ought to be; the most noble, and the most suitable
to the wise, - tranquillity, security, freedom. For
in this case we are not to give credit to the many,
who say that none ought to be educated but the free;
but rather to the philosophers, who say that the wise
alone are free.</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>Thus: is freedom anything else than the power of
living as we like?</p>
<p>"Nothing else."
Well; tell me then, do you like to live in error?
" We do not. No one who lives in error is free."</p>
<p>Do you like to live in fear? Do you like to live in
sorrow? Do you like to live in perturbation?</p>
<p>" By no means."</p>
<p>No one, therefore, in a state of fear, or sorrow, or
perturbation, is free; but whoever is delivered from
sorrow, fear, and perturbation, by the same means is
delivered likewise from slavery. How shall we believe you, then, good legislators, when you say, " We
allow none to be educated but the free "? For the
<pb id="p.1112"/>
philosophers say, "We allow none to be free but the
wise; " that is, God doth not allow it.</p>
<p>" What, then; when any person hath turned his slave
about before the consul,1 has he done nothing? "</p>
<p>Yes, he has.</p>
<p>"What? "
He has turned his slave about before the consul.</p>
<p>" Nothing more? "</p>
<p>Yes. He pays a fine for him.</p>
<p>"Well, then; is not the man who has gone through
this ceremony rendered free?"</p>
<p>Only so far as he is emancipated from perturbation.
Pray, have you, who are able to give this freedom to
others, no master of your own? Are you not a slave
to money; to a girl; to a boy; to a tyrant; to
some friend of a tyrant? Else why do you tremble when any one of these is in question? Therefore,
I so often repeat to you, let this be your study and
constant pursuit, to learn in what it is necessary to be
courageous, and in what cautious; courageous against
the inevitable, cautious so far as your will can control.</p>
<p>" But have I not read my essay to you? Do not
you know what I am doing?"</p>
<p>In what?</p>
<p>" In my essays."</p>
<p>Show me in what state you are as to desires and
aversions; whether you do not fail of what you wish,
and incur what you would avoid; but, as to these</p>
<p rend="center">1 The prescribed form of manumission. - H.
<pb id="p.1113"/>
commonplace essays, if you are wise, you will take
them, and destroy them.</p>
<p>"Why? Did not <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> write?"</p>
<p>Yes; who so much? But how? As he had not
always one at hand to argue against his principles,
or be argued against in his turn, he argued with and
examined himself, and always made practical application of some one great principle at least. These
are the things which a philosopher writes; but such
commonplaces as those of which I speak he leaves
to the foolish, or to the happy creatures whom idleness furnishes with leisure, or to such as are too
weak to regard consequences. And yet will you,
when opportunity offers, come forward to exhibit and
read aloud such things, and take a pride in them?</p>
<p>"Pray, see how I compose dialogues."</p>
<p>Talk not of that, man, but rather be able to say,
See how I accomplish my purposes; see how I avert
what I wish to shun. Set death before me; set pain,
a prison, disgrace, doom, and you will know me?
This should be the pride of a young man come out
from the schools. Leave the rest to others. Let no
one ever hear you waste a word upon them, nor suffer it, if any one commends you for them; but admit
that you are nobody, and that you know nothing.
Appear to know only this, never to fail nor fall. Let
others study cases, problems, and syllogisms. Do
you rather contemplate death, change, torture, exile;
and all these with courage, and reliance upon Him
<pb id="p.1114"/>
who hath called you to them, and judged you worthy
a post in which you may show what reason can do
when it encounters the inevitable. And thus this
paradox ceases to be a paradox, that we must be at
once cautious and courageous; courageous against
the inevitable, and cautious when events are within
our own control.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Of tranquillity.</head>
<p>Consider, you who are going to take your trial,
what you wish to preserve, and in what to succeed. For if you wish to preserve a mind in harmony
with nature, you are entirely safe; everything goes
well; you have no trouble on your hands. While
you wish to preserve that freedom which belongs to
you, and are contented with that, for what have you
longer to be anxious? For who is the master of
things like these? Who can take them away? If
you wish to be a man of modesty and fidelity, who
shall prevent you? If you wish not to be restrained
or compelled, who shall compel you to desires contrary to your principles; to aversions contrary to
your opinion? The judge, perhaps, will pass a sentence against you, which he thinks formidable; but
can he likewise make you receive it with shrink-
<pb id="p.1115"/>
ing? Since, then, desire and aversion are in your
own power, for what have you to be anxious? Let
this be your introduction; this your narration; this
your proof; this your conclusion; this your victory;
and this your applause. Thus said <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> to one
who put him in mind to prepare himself for his trial:
" Do you not think that I have been preparing myself for this very thing my whole life long?" By
what kind of preparation?  "I have attended to my
own work." What mean you? "I have done
nothing unjust, either in public or in private life."</p>
<p>But if you wish to retain possession of outward
things too, your body, your estate, your dignity, I
advise you immediately to prepare yourself by every
possible preparation; and besides, to consider the
disposition of your judge and of your adversary. If
it be necessary to embrace his knees, do so; if to
weep, weep; if to groan, groan  For when you have
once made yourself a slave to externals, be a slave
wholly; do not struggle, and be alternately willing
and unwilling, but be simply and thoroughly the one
or the other, _ --free, or a slave; instructed, or ignorant;
a game-cock, or a craven; either bear to be beaten
till you die, or give out at once; and do not be
soundly beaten first, and then give out at last.</p>
<p>If both alternatives be shameful, learn immediately
to distinguish where good and evil lie. They lie
where truth likewise lies. Where truth and nature
dictate, there exercise caution or courage. Why, do
<pb id="p.1116"/>
you think that if <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> had concerned himself
about externals, he would have said, when he appeared at his trial, "Anytus and Melitus may indeed
kill me, but hurt me they cannot "? Was he so foolish
as not to see that this way did not lead to safety, but
the contrary? What, then, is the reason that he not
only disregarded, but defied, his judges? Thus my
friend Heraclitus, in a trifling suit about a little estate at <placeName key="tgn,2616123">Rhodes</placeName>, after having proved to the judges that
his cause was good, when he came to the conclusion
of his speech, "I will not entreat you," said he;
"nor be anxious as to what judgment you give; for
it is rather you who are to be judged, than I." And
thus he lost his suit. What need was there of this?
Be content not to entreat; yet do not proclaim that
you will not entreat; unless it be a proper time to
provoke the judges designedly, as in the case of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>. But if you too are preparing such a speech
as his, what do you wait for? Why do you consent
to be tried?  For if you wish to be hanged, have patience, and the gibbet will come. But if you choose
rather to consent, and make your defence as well as
you can, all the rest is to be. ordered accordingly,
with a due regard, however, to the preservation of
your own proper character.</p>
<p>For this reason it is absurd to call upon me for
specific advice. How should I know what to advise
you? Ask me rather to teach you to accommodate
yourself to whatever may be the event. The former
<pb id="p.1117"/>
is just as if an illiterate person should say; "Tell me
how to write down some name that is proposed to
me;" and I show him how to write the name of
Dion; and then another comes, and asks him to write
the name, not of Dion, but of <placeName key="tgn,2108019">Theon</placeName>. What will
be the consequence?  What will he write?  Whereas,
if you make writing your study, you are ready prepared for whatever word may occur; if not, how can I
advise you? For if the actual case should suggest
something else, what will you say, or how will you
act? Remember, then, the general rule, and you
will need no special suggestions; but if you are
absorbed in externals, you must necessarily be tossed
up and down, according to the inclination of your
master.</p>
<p>Who is your master? Whosoever controls those
things which you seek or shun.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Concerning such as recommend persons to the philosophers.</head>
<p>Diogenes rightly answered one who desired letters of recommendation from him: "At first
sight he will know you to be a man; and whether
you are a good or a bad man, if he has any skill in
distinguishing, he will know likewise; and if he has
<pb id="p.1118"/>
not, he will never know it, though I should write a
thousand times." Just as if you were a piece of coin,
and should desire to be recommended to any person
as good, in order to be tried; if it be to an assayer,
he will know your value, for you will recommend
yourself.</p>
<p>We ought, therefore, in life also to have something analogous to this skill in gold; that one may be
able to say, like the assayer, Bring me whatever piece
you will, and I will find out its value; or, as I would
say with regard to syllogisms, Bring me whomsoever
you will, and I will distinguish for you whether he
knows how to solve syllogisms, or not. Why?  Because I can do that myself, and have that faculty
which is necessary for one who can discern persons
skilled in such solutions. But how do I act in life?
I sometimes call a thing good, at other times bad.
What is the cause of this? Something contrary to
whit occurs to me in syllogisms, -ignorance and
inexperience.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Concerning a man who had been guilty of adultery.</head>
<p>Just as he was once saying that man is made for
fidelity, and that whoever subverts this subverts
the peculiar property of man, there entered one of
<pb id="p.1119"/>
the so-called literary men, who had been found guilty
of adultery in that city. But, continued Epictetus,
if, laying aside that fidelity for which we were born,
we form designs against the wife of our neighbor,
what do we? What else but destroy and ruin--what?   Fidelity, honor, and sanctity of manners.
Only these? And do not we ruin neighborhood,
friendship, our country? In what rank do we then
place ourselves? How am I to consider you, sir,-
as a neighbor; a friend? What sort of one? As
a citizen?  How shall I trust you? Indeed, if you
were some potsherd, so noisome that no use could
be made of you, you might be thrown on a dunghill, and no mortal would take the trouble to pick
you up; but if, being a man, you cannot fill any
one place in human society, what shall we do with
you? For, suppose you cannot hold the place of a
friend, can you hold even that of a slave? And who
will trust you? Why, then, should not you also be
contented to be thrown upon some dunghill, as a
useless vessel, and indeed as worse than that? Will
you say, after this, Has no one any regard for me, a
man of letters?  Why, you are wicked, and fit for no
use. Just as if wasps should take it ill that no one
has any regard for them, but all shun, and whoever
can, beats them down. You have such a sting that
whoever you strike with it is thrown into troubles
and sorrows. What would you have us do with you?
There is nowhere to place you.
<pb id="p.1120"/></p>
<p>" What, then; are not women made by nature accessible to all?"</p>
<p>I admit it; and so is food at table accessible to
those who are invited. But, after it is distributed, will
you go and snatch away the share of him who sits
next you; or slyly steal it, or stretch out your hand,
and taste; and if you cannot tear away any of the
meat, dip your fingers and lick them? A fine companion ! A Socratic guest indeed! Again, is not
the theatre common to all the citizens? Therefore
come, when all are seated, if you dare, and turn
any one of them out of his place. In this sense
only are women accessible by nature; but when the
laws, like a good host, have distributed them, cannot
you, like the rest of the company, be contented with
your own share, but must you pilfer, and taste what
belongs to another?</p>
<p>"But I am a man of letters, and understand
Archedemus."</p>
<p>With all your understanding of Archedemus, then,
you will be an adulterer and a rogue; and instead
of a man, a wolf or an ape. For where is the
difference?

<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<head>How nobleness of mind may be consistent with prudence.</head>
<p>The materials of action are variable, but the use
we make of them should be constant.</p>
<p>How, then, shall one combine composure and tranquillity with energy; doing nothing rashly, nothing
carelessly?</p>
<p>By imitating those who play at games. The dice
are variable; the pieces are variable. How do I
know what will fall out? But it is my business to
manage carefully and dexterously, whatever happens.
Thus in life too, this is the chief business, to consider
and discriminate things, and say, " Externals are not
in my power; choice is. Where shall I seek good
and evil? Within; in what is my own." But in
what is controlled by others, count nothing good or
evil, profitable or hurtful, or any such thing.</p>
<p>What, then; are we to treat these in a careless
way?</p>
<p>By no means; for this, on the other hand, would
be a perversion of the will, and so contrary to nature.
But we are to act with care, because the use of our
materials is not indifferent; and at the same time with
calmness and tranquillity, because the materials them-
<pb id="p.1122"/>
selves are uncertain. For where a thing is not uncertain, there no one can restrain or compel me.
Where I am capable of being restrained or compelled,
the acquisition does not depend upon me; nor is it
either good or evil. The use of it, indeed, is either
good or evil; but that <emph>does</emph> depend upon me. It is
difficult, I own, to blend and unite tranquillity in
accepting, and energy in using, the facts of life; but
it is not impossible; if it be, it is impossible to be
happy. How do we act in a voyage? What is in
my power? To choose the pilot, the sailors, the day,
the hour. Afterwards comes a storm. What have
I to care for? My part is performed. This matter
belongs to another, to the pilot. But the ship is
sinking; what then have I to do?  That which alone
I can do; I submit to being drowned, without fear,
without clamor, or accusing God; but as one who
knows that what is born must likewise die. For
I am not eternity, but a man, - a part of the whole,
as an hour is of the day. I must come like an hour,
and like an hour must pass away. What signifies it
whether by drowning or by a fever? For, in some
way or other, pass I must.</p>
<p>This you may see to be the practice of those who
play skilfully at ball. No one strives for the ball
itself, as either a good or an evil; but how he may
throw and catch it again. Here lies the address,
here the art, the nimbleness, the skill; lest I fail
to catch it, even when I open my breast for it, while
<pb id="p.1123"/>
another catches it whenever I throw it. But if we
catch or throw it in fear and trembling, what kind of
play will this be? How shall we keep ourselves
steady, or how see the order of the game?  One will
say, throw; another, do not throw; a third, you have
thrown once already. This is a mere quarrel, not a
play. Therefore <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> well understood playing
at ball.</p>

a God? What do you think demons are?  Are they
not either the offspring of the gods, or compounded
of gods and men?"   Yes.  "Do you think, then,
that one can believe there are mules, and not believe
that there are asses?"  This was just as if he had
been playing at ball. And what was the ball he had
to play with? Life, chains, exile, a draught of poison, separation from a wife, and leaving his children
orphans. These were what he had to play with; and
yet he did play, and threw the ball with address.
Thus we should be careful as to the play, but indifferent as to the ball. We are by all means to manage
our materials with art, - not taking them for the best,
but showing our art about them, whatever they may
happen to be. Thus a weaver does not make the
wool, but employs his art upon what is given him.
It is another who gives you food and property, and
may take them away, and your paltry body too. Do
<pb id="p.1124"/>
you, however, work upon the materials you have
received; and then, if you come off unhurt, others,
no doubt, who meet you, will congratulate you on your
escape. But he who has a clearer insight into such
things will praise and congratulate you if he sees
you to have done well; but if you owe your escape
to any unbecoming action, he will do the contrary.
For where there is a reasonable cause for rejoicing,
there is cause likewise for congratulation.</p>
<p>How, then, are some external circumstances said
to be according to nature; others contrary to it?</p>
<p>Only when we are viewed as isolated individuals.
I will allow that it is natural for the foot (for instance) to be clean. But if you take it as a foot,
and not as a mere isolated thing, it will be fit that it
should walk in the dirt, and tread upon thorns; and
sometimes that it should even be cut off, for the good
of the whole; otherwise it is no longer a foot. We
should reason in some such manner concerning ourselves. Who are you? A man. If then, indeed,
you consider yourself isolatedly, it is natural that you
should live to old age, should be prosperous and
healthy; but if you consider yourself as a man, and
as a part of the whole, it will be fit, in view of that
whole, that you should at one time be sick; at
another, take a voyage, and be exposed to danger;
sometimes be in want; and possibly die before your
time. Why, then, are you displeased? Do not you
know that otherwise, just as the other ceases to be a
<pb id="p.1125"/>
foot, so you are no longer a man? For what is
a man? A part of a commonwealth; first and chiefly
of that which includes both gods and men; and next,
of that to which you immediately belong, which is
a miniature of the universal city.</p>
<p>What, then; must I, at one time, go before a tribunal; must another, at another time, be scorched by a
fever; another be exposed to the sea; another die;
another be condemned?</p>
<p>Yes; for it is impossible, in such a body, in such a
world, and among such companions, but that some
one or other of us must meet with such circumstances. Your business, then, is simply to say what
you ought, to order things as the case requires.
After this comes some one and says, "I pronounce
that you have acted unjustly."  Much good may it
do you; I have done my part. You are to look to
it, whether you have done yours; for you may as
well understand that there is some danger in that
quarter also.

<p>A process of reasoning may be an indifferent
thing; but our judgment concerning it is not
indifferent; for it is either knowledge, or opinion, or
mistake. So the events of life occur indifferently, but
the use of it is not indifferent. When you are told,
therefore, that these things are indifferent, do not, on
that account, ever be careless; nor yet, when you are
governed by prudence, be abject, and dazzled by externals. It is good to know your own qualifications
and powers; that, where you are not qualified, you
may be quiet, and not angry that others have there
the advantage of you.   For you too will think it
reasonable, that you should have the advantage in
the art of reasoning; and, if others should be angry
at it, you will tell them, by way of consolation, " This
I have learned, and you have not." Thus too, wherever practice is necessary, do not pretend to what can
only be attained by practice; but leave the matter to
those who are practised, and do you be contented in
your own serenity.
<pb id="p.1127"/></p>
<p>"Go, for instance, and pay your court to such a
person." How? I will not do it abjectly. So I
find myself shut out; for I have not learned to get
in at the window, and finding the door shut, I must
necessarily either go back, or get in at the window.
"But speak to him at least."  I am willing. "In
what manner?"   Not basely at any rate. "Well,
you have failed." This is not your business, but his.
Why do you claim what belongs to another? Always
remember what is your own, and what is another's,
and you will never be disturbed.</p>
<p>Hence Chrysippus rightly says: While consequences are uncertain, I will keep to those things
which will bring me most in harmony with nature;
for God himself hath formed me to choose this. If I
knew that it was inevitable for me to be sick, I would
conform my inclinations that way; for even the foot,
if it had understanding, would be inclined to get into
the dirt. For why are ears of corn produced, if it be
not to ripen? And why do they ripen, if not to be
reaped? For they are not isolated, individual things.
If they were capable of sense, do you think they
would wish never to be reaped?  It would be a curse
upon ears of corn not to be reaped, and we ought to
know that it would be a curse upon man not to die;
like that of not ripening, and not being reaped.
Since, then, it is necessary for us to be reaped, and
we have at the same time understanding to know it,
are we angry at it?  This is only because we neither
<pb id="p.1128"/>
know what we are, nor have we studied what belongs
to man, as jockeys do what belongs to horses. Yet
Chrysantas, when he was about to strike an enemy,
on hearing the trumpet sound a retreat, drew back
his hand; for he thought it more eligible to obey the
command of his general, than his own inclination.<note anchored="yes">In a speech which <placeName key="tgn,2273621">Cyrus</placeName> made to his soldiers, after the battle with the Assyrians, he mentioned Chrysantas, one of his captains, with particular honor, for this instance of obedience. <bibl n="Xen.

But not one of us, even when necessity calls, is ready
and willing to obey it; but we weep and groan over
painful events, calling  them  our "circumstances."
What circumstances, man? For if you call what
surrounds you circumstances, everything is a circumstance; but if by this you mean hardships,
where is the hardship, that whatever is born must
die? The instrument is either a sword, or a wheel,
or the sea, or a tile, or a tyrant; and what does
it signify to you by what way you descend to
Hades? All are equal; but, if you would hear
the truth, the shortest is that by which a tyrant
sends you.   No tyrant was ever six months in
cutting any man's throat; but a fever often takes
a year. All these things are mere sound, and the
tumor of empty names.</p>

long listening to this old man. Only remember the

your own, and you will never claim what belongs to
others. Judicial bench or dungeon, each is but a
place, -one high, the other low; but your will is
equal to either condition, and if you have a mind to
keep it so, it may be so kept. We shall then become

<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Of divination.</head>
<p>From an unseasonable regard to divination, we
omit many duties; for what can the diviner
contemplate besides death, danger, sickness, and such
matters? When it is necessary, then, to expose one's
self to danger for a friend, or even a duty to die for
him, what occasion have I for divination? Have not
I a diviner within, who has told me the essence of
good and evil, and who explains to me the indications of both?  What further need, then, have I of
signs or auguries? Can I tolerate the other diviner,
when he says, "This is for your interest "? For does
he know what is for my interest? Does he know
what good is? Has he learned the indications of
<pb id="p.1131"/>
good and evil, as he has those of the victims? If so,
he knows the indications likewise of fair and base,
just and unjust. You may predict to me, sir, what is
to befall me, - life or death, riches or poverty. But
whether these things are for my interest or not, I
shall not inquire of you. "Why?" Because you
cannot even give an opinion about points of grammar;
and do you give it here, in things about which all
men differ and dispute? Therefore the lady who
was going to send a month's provision to Gratilla,<note anchored="yes">A lady of high rank at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, banished from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, among many noble persons, by Domitian. - C.</note> in
*her banishment, made a right answer to one who
told her that Domitian would seize it.   "I had
rather," said she, "that he should seize it, than I not
send it."</p>
<p>What, then, is it that leads us so often to divination? Cowardice; the dread of events. Hence we
flatter the diviners. "Pray, sir, shall I inherit my
father's estate? "  " Let us see; let us sacrifice upon
the occasion."  "Nay, sir, just as fortune pleases."
Then if he predicts that we shall inherit it, we give
him thanks, as if we received the inheritance from
<emph>him</emph>. The consequence of this is, that they impose
upon us.</p>
<p>What, then, is to be done?</p>
<p>We should come without previous desire or aversion; as a traveller inquires the road of the person
he meets, without any desire for that which turns to
<pb id="p.1132"/>
the right hand, more than for that to the left; for he
wishes for neither of these, but only for that road
which leads him properly. Thus we should come to
God as to a guide,--just as we make use of our
eyes; not persuading them to show us one object
rather than another, but receiving such as they present to us. But now we conduct the augury with
fear and trembling, and in our invocations to God,
entreat him: " Lord, have mercy upon me, suffer me
to come off safe." Foolish man! would you have
anything then but what is best? And what is best
but what pleases God? Why would you then, so far
as in you lies, corrupt your judge and seduce your
adviser?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Wherein consists the essence of good.</head>
<p>God is beneficial. Good is also beneficial. It
should seem, then, that where the essence of
God is, there too is the essence of good. What then
is the essence of God, - flesh? By no means. An
estate? Fame? By no means. Intelligence? Knowledge? Right reason? Certainly. Here, then, without more ado, seek the essence of good. For do you
seek that quality in a plant? No. Or in a brute?
No. If, then, you seek it only in a rational subject,
why do you seek it anywhere but in what distin-
<pb id="p.1133"/>
guishes that from things irrational? Plants make no
voluntary use of things, and therefore you do not
apply the term of <emph>good</emph> to them. <emph>Good</emph>, then, implies
such use. And nothing else? If so, you may say
that good and-happiness and unhappiness belong to
mere animals. But this you do not say, and you are
right; for, how much soever they have the use of
things, they have not the intelligent use, and with
good reason; for they are made to be subservient to
others, and not of primary importance. Why was
an ass made? Was it as being of primary importance?  No; but because we had need of a back
able to carry burdens. We had need too that he
should be capable of locomotion; therefore he had
the voluntary use of things added, otherwise he could
not have moved. But here his endowments end;
for, if an understanding of that use had been likewise
added, he would not, in reason, have been subject
to us, nor have done us these services, but would
have been like and equal to ourselves. Why will
you not, therefore, seek the essence of good in that
without which you cannot say that there is good in
anything?</p>
<p>What then? Are not all these likewise the works
of the gods? They are; but not primary existences,
nor parts of the gods. But you are a primary existence. You are a distinct portion of the essence of
God, and contain a certain part of him in yourself.
Why then are you ignorant of your noble birth?
<pb id="p.1134"/>
Why do not you consider whence you came? Why
do not you remember, when you are eating, who you
are who eat, and whom you feed? When you are
in the company of women, when you are conversing,
when you are exercising, when you are disputing,
do not you know that it is the Divine you feed, the
Divine you exercise? You carry a God about with
you, poor wretch, and know nothing of it. Do you
suppose I mean some god without you of gold or silver? It is within yourself that you carry him; and
you do not observe that you profane him by impure
thoughts and unclean actions. If the mere external
image of God were present, you would not dare to act
as you do; and when God himself is within you, and
hears and sees all, are not you ashamed to think and
act thus, - insensible of your own nature, and at enmity with God?</p>
<p>Why, then, are we afraid, when we send a young
man from the school into active life, that he should
behave indecently, eat indecently, converse indecently
with women; that he should either debase himself by
slovenliness, or clothe himself too finely? Knows he
not the God within him?   Knows he not in what
company he goes? It is provoking to hear him
say [to his instructor], " I wish to have <emph>you</emph> with
me." Have you not God? Do you seek any other,
while you have him? Or will He tell you any other
things than these? If you were a statue of Phidias.
as Zeus or Athena, you would remember both yourself
<pb id="p.1135"/>
and the artist; and if you had any sense, you would
endeavor to be in no way unworthy of him who
formed you, nor of yourself; nor to appear in an
unbecoming manner to spectators. And are you now
careless how you appear when you are the workmanship of Zeus himself? And yet, what comparison
is there, either between the artists, or the things
they have formed?  What work of any artist has
conveyed into its structure those very faculties which
are shown in shaping it? Is it anything but marble,
or brass, or gold, or ivory? And the Athena of
Phidias, when its hand is once extended, and a
<emph>Victory</emph> placed in it, remains in that attitude forever.
But the works of God are endowed with motion,
breath, the powers of use and judgment. Being, then,
the work of such an artist, will you dishonor him,
especially when he hath not only formed you, but
given your guardianship to yourself? Will you not
only be forgetful of this, but, moreover, dishonor the
trust?  If God had committed some orphan to your
charge, would you have been thus careless of him?
He has delivered yourself to your care; and says, "I
had no one fitter to be trusted than you; preserve
this person for me, such as he is by nature, - modest,
faithful, noble, unterrified, dispassionate, tranquil."
And will you not preserve him?</p>
<p>But it will be said: "What need of this lofty
look, and dignity of face?"</p>
<p>I answer, that I have not yet so much dignity as
<pb id="p.1136"/>
the case demands; for I do not yet trust to what I
have learned, and accepted. I still fear my own
weakness. Let me but take courage a little, and
then you shall see such a look, and such an appearance, as I ought to have. Then I will show you the
statue when it is finished, when it is polished. Do
you think I will show you a supercilious countenance?  Heaven forbid! For Olympian Zeus doth
not haughtily lift his brow, but keeps a steady countenance, as becomes him who is about to say,-
<cit><quote><l>My promise is irrevocable, sure.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.526">Iliad, 1.526</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Such will I show myself to you; faithful, modest,
noble, tranquil.</p>
<p>"What, and immortal too, and exempt from age
and sickness?"</p>
<p>No. But sickening and dying as becomes the
divine within me. This is in my power; this I can
do. The other is not in my power, nor can I do
it. Shall I show you the muscular training. of a
philosopher?</p>
<p rend="right">"What muscles are those?"</p>
<p>A will undisappointed, evils avoided, powers duly
exerted, careful resolutions, unerring  decisions.</p>
<p>These you shall see.
<pb id="p.1137"/></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<head>That some persons, failing to fulfil what the character of a man implies, assume that of a philosopher.</head>
<p>It were no slight attainment, could we merely fulfil what the nature of man implies. For what is
man? A rational and mortal being. Well; from
what are we distinguished by reason? From wild
beasts. From what else? From sheep, and the like.</p>
<p>Take care, then, to do nothing like a wild beast;
otherwise you have destroyed the man; you have not
fulfilled what your nature promises. Take care too,
to do nothing like cattle; for thus likewise the man
is destroyed.</p>
<p>In what do we act like cattle?</p>
<p>When we act gluttonously, lewdly, rashly, sordidly,
inconsiderately, into what are we sunk? Into cattle.
What have we destroyed? The rational being.</p>
<p>When we behave contentiously, injuriously, passionately, and violently, into what have we sunk?
Into wild beasts.</p>
<p>And further, some of us are wild beasts of a
larger size; others little mischievous vermin, such
as suggest the proverb, Let me rather be eaten by a
lion.
<pb id="p.1138"/></p>
<p>By all these means, that is destroyed which the
nature of man implies.</p>
<p>For when is a conjunctive proposition sustained?
When it fulfils what its nature implies. So then the
sustaining of such a proposition consists in this, that
its several parts remain a series of truths.</p>
<p>When is a disjunctive   proposition  sustained?
When it fulfils what its nature implies.</p>
<p>When is a flute, a harp, a horse, or a dog, preserved in existence? While each fulfils what its
nature implies.</p>
<p>Where is the wonder, then, that manhood should
be preserved or destroyed in the same manner? All
things are preserved and improved by exercising their
proper functions; as a carpenter, by building; a
grammarian, by grammar; but if he permit himself
to write ungrammatically, his art will necessarily be
spoiled and destroyed. Thus modest actions preserve
the modest man, and immodest ones destroy him;
faithful actions preserve the faithful man, and the
contrary destroy him. On the other hand, the contrary actions heighten the contrary characters. Thus
the practice of immodesty develops an immodest
character; knavery, a knavish one; slander, a slanderous one; anger, an angry one; and fraud, a
covetous one.</p>
<p>For this reason, philosophers advise us not to be
contented with mere learning, but to add meditation
likewise, and then practice. For we have been long
<pb id="p.1139"/>
accustomed to perverse actions, and have practised
upon wrong opinions. If, therefore, we do not likewise habituate ourselves to practise upon right opinions, we shall be nothing more than expositors of the
abstract doctrines of others. For who among us is
not already able to discourse, according to the rules
of art, upon good and evil? -" That some things are
good, some evil, and others indifferent; the good include the virtues and all things appertaining; the
evil comprise the contrary; and the indifferent include
riches, health, reputation;" and then, if while we
are saying all this, there should happen some more
than ordinary noise, or one of the by-standers should
laugh at us, we are disconcerted. Philosopher, what
is become of what you were saying? Whence did it
proceed, - merely from your lips? Why, then, do
you confound the remedies which might be useful to
others? Why do you trifle on the most important
subjects? It is one thing to hoard up provision in a
storehouse, and another to eat it. What is eaten
is assimilated, digested, and becomes nerves, flesh,
bones, blood, color, breath. Whatever is hoarded is
ready indeed, whenever you desire to show it; but is
of no further use to you than in the mere knowledge
that you have it.</p>
<p>For what difference does it make whether you discourse on these doctrines, or those of the heterodox?
Sit down and comment skilfully on Epicurus, for instance; perhaps you may comment more profitable
<pb id="p.1140"/>
than himself. Why then do you call yourself a Stoic?
Why do you act like a Jew, when you are a Greek?
Do not you see on what terms each is called a Jew, a
Syrian, an Egyptian? And when we see any one
wavering, we are wont to say, This is not a Jew, but
only acts like one. But, when he assumes the sentiments of one who has been baptized and circumcised,
then he both really is, and is called, a Jew. Thus we,
falsifying our profession, may be Jews in name, but are
in reality something else. We are inconsistent with
our own discourse; we are far from practising what
we teach, and what we pride ourselves on knowing.
Thus, while we are unable to fulfil what the character
of a man implies, we are ready to assume besides so
vast a weight as that of a philosopher. As if a
person, incapable of lifting ten pounds, should endeavor to heave the same stone with Ajax.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<head>How we may infer the duties of life from its nominal functions.</head>
<p>Consider who you are. In the first place, a
man; that is, one who recognizes nothing superior to the faculty of free will, but all things as
subject to this; and this itself as not to be enslaved
or subjected to anything. Consider, then, from what
<pb id="p.1141"/>
you are distinguished by reason. You are distinguished from wild beasts; you are distinguished from
cattle. Besides, you are a citizen of the universe,
and a part of it; not a subordinate, but a principal
part. You are capable of comprehending the Divine
economy, and of considering the connections of
things. What then does the character of a citizen
imply? To hold no private interest; to deliberate of
nothing as a separate individual, but rather like the
hand or the foot, which, if they had reason, and comprehended the constitution of nature, would never
pursue, or desire, but with a reference to the whole.
Hence the philosophers rightly say, that, if it were
possible for a wise and good man to foresee what was
to happen, he might co-operate in bringing on himself
sickness, and death, and mutilation, being sensible
that these things are appointed in the order of the
universe; and that the whole is superior to a part.
and the city to the citizen. But, since we do not
foreknow what is to happen, it becomes our duty to
hold to what is more agreeable to our choice, for this
too is a part of our birthright.</p>
<p>Remember next, that perhaps you are a son, and
what does this character imply? To esteem everything that is his, as belonging to his father; in every
instance to obey him; not to revile him to any one;
not to say or do anything injurious to him; to give
way and yield in everything, co-operating with him
to the utmost of his power.
<pb id="p.1142"/></p>
<p>After this, know likewise, that you are a brother
too; and that to this character it belongs to make
concessions, to be easily persuaded, to use gentle
language, never to claim for yourself any non-essential
thing, but cheerfully to give up these to be repaid
by a larger share of things essential. For consider
what it is, instead of a lettuce, for instance, or a chair,
to procure for yourself a good temper. How great
an advantage gained!</p>
<p>If, beside this, you are a senator of any city, demean yourself as a senator; if a youth, as a youth; if
an old man, as an old man. For each of these names,
if it comes to be considered, always points out the
proper duties; but, if you go and revile your brother,
I tell you that you have forgotten who you are, and
what is your name. If you were a smith, and made
an ill use of the hammer, you would have forgotten
the smith; and if you have forgotten the brother, and
are become, instead of a brother, an enemy, do you
imagine you have made no change of one thing for
another, in that case?  If, instead of a man, - a gentle, social creature, - you have become a wild beast,
mischievous, insidious, biting, have you lost nothing?
Is it only the loss of money which is reckoned damage; and is there no other thing, the loss of which
damages a man?  If you were to part with your skill
in grammar or in music, would you think the loss of
these a damage; and yet, if you part with honor,
decency, and gentleness, do you think that no matter
<pb id="p.1143"/>
Yet the first may be lost by some cause external and
inevitable; but the last only by our own fault. There
is no shame in not having or in losing the one; but
either not to have or to lose the other is equally
shameful and reproachful and unhappy. What does
the debauchee lose?  Manhood. What does he lose
who made him such? Many things, but manhood
also. What does an adulterer lose? The modest,
the chaste character; the good neighbor. What does
an angry person lose?  A coward?  Each loses his
portion. No one is wicked without some loss or
damage. Now if, after all, you treat the loss of
money as the only damage, all these are unhurt and
uninjured. Nay, they may be even gainers; as, by
such practices, their money may possibly be increased.
But consider; if you refer everything to money, then
a man who loses his nose is not hurt. Yes, say you;
he is maimed in his body. Well, but does he who
loses his sense of smell itself lose nothing? Is there,
then, no faculty of the soul which benefits the possessor, and which it is an injury to lose?</p>
<p>" Of what sort do you mean? "</p>
<p>Have we not a natural sense of honor?</p>
<p>" We have."</p>
<p>Does he who loses this suffer no damage? Is he
deprived of nothing? Does he part with nothing
that belongs to him? Have we no natural fidelity;
no natural affection; no natural disposition to mutual usefulness, to mutual forbearance? Is he, then,
<pb id="p.1144"/>
who carelessly suffers himself to be damaged in these
respects still safe and uninjured?</p>
<p>" What, then; shall not I injure him who has injured me?"</p>
<p>Consider first what injury is; and remember what
you have heard from the philosophers. For, if both
good and evil lie in the will, see whether what you
say does not amount to this: "Since he has hurt
himself by injuring me, shall I not hurt myself by
injuring him?"  Why do we not make to ourselves
some such representation as this?  Are we hurt
when any detriment happens to our bodily possessions, and are we not at all hurt when our will is depraved? He who has erred, or injured another, has
indeed no pain in his head; nor loses an eye, nor a
leg, nor an estate; and we wish for nothing beyond
these. Whether our will be habitually humble and
faithful, or shameless and unfaithful, we regard as a
thing indifferent, except only in the discussions of the
schools. In that case, all the improvement we make
reaches only to words; and beyond them is absolutely
nothing.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<head>The beginning of philosophy.</head>
<p>The beginning of philosophy, at least to such as
enter upon it in a proper way, and by the door,
is a consciousness of our own weakness and inability
<pb id="p.1145"/>
in necessary things. For we came into the world
without any natural idea of a right-angled triangle;
of a diesis, or a semitone, in music; but we learn each
of these things by some artistic instruction. Hence,
they who do not understand them do not assume
to understand them. But who ever came into the
world without an innate idea of good and evil, fair and
base, becoming and unbecoming, happiness and misery, proper and improper; what ought to be done,
and what not to be done?  Hence, we all make use
of the terms, and endeavor to apply our impressions
to particular cases. " Such a one hath acted well, not.
well; right, not right; is unhappy, is happy; is just,
is unjust." Which of us refrains from these terms?
Who defers the use of them till he has learnt it, as
those do who are ignorant of lines and sounds?
The reason of this is, that we come instructed in some
degree by nature upon these subjects; and from this
beginning, we go on to add self-conceit. " For why,"
say you, "should I not know what fair or base is?
Have I not the idea of it?" You have. "Do I not
apply this idea to the particular instance? " You do.
"Do I not apply it rightly, then?"  Here lies the
whole question; and here arises the self-conceit.
Beginning from these acknowledged points, men proceed, by applying them improperly, to reach the very
position most questionable. For, if they knew how
to apply them also, they would be all but perfect.</p>
<p>If you think that you know how to apply your gen-
<pb id="p.1146"/>
eral principles to particular cases, tell me on what you
base this application.</p>
<p>" Upon its seeming so to me."</p>
<p>But it does not seem so to another; and does not
ne too think that he makes a right application?</p>
<p>"He does."</p>
<p>Is it possible, then, that each of you should rightly
apply your principles, on the very subjects about
which your opinions conflict?</p>
<p>" It is not."</p>
<p>Have you anything to show us, then, for this application, beyond the fact of its seeming so to you?
And does a madman act any otherwise than seems to
him right?  Is this, then, a sufficient criterion for him
too?</p>
<p>" It is not."</p>
<p>Come, therefore, to some stronger ground than
seeming.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>The beginning of philosophy is this: the being
sensible of the disagreement of men with each other;
an inquiry into the cause of this disagreement; and
a disapprobation and distrust of what merely seems;
a careful examination into what seems, whether it
seem rightly; and the discovery of some rule which
shall serve like a balance, for the determination of
weights; like a square, for distinguishing straight and
crooked. This is the beginning of philosophy.</p>
<p>Is it possible that all things which seem right to all
<pb id="p.1147"/>
persons are so? Can things contradictory be right?
We say not all things; but all that seem so to <emph>us</emph>.
And why more to <emph>you</emph> than to the Syrians or Egyptians; than to me, or to any other man? Not at all
more.</p>
<p>Therefore, what seems to each man is not sufficient
to determine the reality of a thing; for even in
weights and measures we are not satisfied with the
bare appearance, but for everything we find some
rule. And is there, then, in the present case no rule
preferable to what seems? Is it possible that what
is of the greatest necessity in human life should be
left incapable of determination and discovery?</p>
<p>There must be some rule. And why do we not
seek and discover it, and, when we have discovered,
ever after make use of it, without fail, so as not even
to move a finger without it? For this, I conceive, is
what, when found, will cure those of their madness
who make use of no other measure but their own
perverted way of thinking. Afterwards, beginning
from certain known and determinate points, we may
make use of general principles, properly applied to
particulars.</p>
<p>Thus, what is the subject that falls under our inquiry? Pleasure. Bring it to the rule. Throw it
into the scale. Must good be something in which it
is fit to confide, and to which we may trust? Yes.
Is it fit to trust to anything unstable?  No. Is pleasure, then, a stable thing? No. Take it, then, and
<pb id="p.1148"/>
throw it out of the scale, and drive it far distant from
the place of good things.</p>
<p>But, if you are not quick-sighted, and one balance
is insufficient, bring another. Is it fit to be elated by
good?  Yes. Is it fit, then, to be elated by a present
pleasure?  See that you do not say it is; otherwise I
shall not think you so much as worthy to use a scale.
Thus are things judged and weighed, when we have
the rules ready. This is the part of philosophy, to
examine, and fix the rules; and to make use of them,
when they are known, is the business of a wise and
good man.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Of disputation.</head>
<p>What things are to be learned, in order to the
right use of reason; the philosophers of our
sect have accurately taught; but we are altogether
unpractised in the due application of them. Only
give to any one of us whom you will some illiterate
person for an antagonist, and he will not find out how
to treat him. But when he has a little moved the
man, if he happens to answer at cross purposes, the
questioner knows not how to deal with him any further, but either reviles or laughs at him, and says:
"He is an illiterate fellow; there is no making anything of him." Yet a guide, when he perceives his
<pb id="p.1149"/>
charge going out of the way, does not revile and ridicule and then leave him, but leads him into the
right path. Do you also show your antagonist the
truth, and you will see that he will follow. But till
you show it, do not ridicule him; but rather be sensible of your own incapacity.</p>
<p>How, then, did <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> use to act? He obliged
his antagonist himself to bear testimony to him; and
wanted no other witness.  Hence he might well
say,<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 474a">Plato, Gorgias,  69</bibl>, and elsewhere. - H.</note> " I give up all the rest, and am always satisfied
with the testimony of my opponent; and I call in no
one to vote, but my antagonist alone." For he rendered the arguments drawn from natural impressions
so clear, that every one saw and avoided the contradiction. " Does an envious man rejoice?"  "By
no means; he rather grieves."  (This he moves him
to say by proposing the contrary.)  "Well, and do
you think envy to be a grief caused by evils?"
"And who ever envied evils? "  (Therefore he
makes the other say, that envy is a grief caused by
things good.)  "Does any one envy those things
which are nothing to him?"  "No, surely."  Having thus fully drawn out his idea, he then leaves that
point, not saying, "Define to me what envy is;"
and after he has defined it, "You have defined it
wrong; for the definition does not correspond to the
thing defined."
<pb id="p.1150"/></p>
<p>There are phrases repulsive and obscure to the
illiterate, which yet we cannot dispense with. But
we have no capacity at all to move them, by such arguments as might lead them, in following the methods
of their own minds, to admit or abandon any position. And from a consciousness of this incapacity,
those among us who have any modesty give the matter entirely up; but the greater part, rashly entering
upon these debates, mutually confound and are confounded, and at last, reviling and reviled, walk off.
Whereas it was the principal and most peculiar
characteristic of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, never to be provoked in a
dispute, nor to throw out any reviling or injurious
expression; but to bear patiently with those who
reviled him, and thus put an end to the controversy.
If you would know how great abilities he had in this
particular, read Xenophon's Banquet, and you will
see how many controversies he ended. Hence, even
among the poets, this is justly mentioned with the
highest commendation,--
<cit><quote><l>Wisely at once the greatest strife to still.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hes. Th. 87">Hesiod, Theogony, 87.- H.</bibl></cit>
But what then? This is no very safe affair now,
and especially at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. For he who does it must
not do it in a corer, but go to some rich consular
senator, for instance, and question him. Pray, sir.
can you tell me to whom you intrust your horses?
<pb id="p.1151"/>
"Yes, certainly." Is it then to any one indifferently,
though he be ignorant of horsemanship?  "By no
means." To whom do you intrust your gold or your
silver or your clothes? "Not to any one indifferently;"  And did you ever consider to whom you
committed the care of your body?  "Yes, surely."
To one skilled in exercise or medicine, I suppose?
" Without doubt."  Are these things your chief good,
or are you possessed of something better than all of
them?  "What do you mean?"  Something which
makes use of these, and deliberates and counsels
about each of them. "What, then; do you mean the
soul?" You have guessed rightly; for indeed I do
mean that. " I do really think it a much better possession than all the rest." Can you show us, then,
in what manner you have taken care of this soul?
For it is not probable that a person of your wisdom
and approved character in the state would carelessly
suffer the most excellent thing that belongs to you to
be neglected and lost. "No, certainly."  But do you
take care of it yourself; and is it done by the instructions of another, or by your own ability?  - Here,
now, comes the danger that he may first say, " Pray,
good sir, what business is that of yours? What are
you to me? " Then if you persist in troubling him,
he may lift up his hand and give you a box on the
ear. I myself was once a great admirer of this
method of instruction, till I fell into this kind of
adventures.

<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Of anxiety.</head>
<p>When I see any one anxious, I say, what does
this man mean? Unless he wanted something or other not in his own power, how could he
still be anxious? A musician, for instance, feels no
anxiety while he is singing by himself; but when he
appears upon the stage he does, even if his voice be
ever so good, or he plays ever so well. For what he
wishes is not only to sing well, but likewise to gain
applause. But this is not in his own power. In
short, where his skill lies, there is his courage. Bring
any ignorant person, and he does not mind him;
but in the point which he neither understands nor
has studied, there he is anxious.</p>
<p>"What point is that?"</p>
<p>He does not understand what a multitude is, nor
what the applause of a multitude. He has learnt,
indeed, how to sound bass and treble; but what the
applause of the many is, and what force it has in
life, he neither understands nor has studied. Hence
he must necessarily tremble and turn pale. I cannot indeed say that a man is no musician, when I
see him afraid; but I can say something else, and
indeed many things. And first of all I call him a
<pb id="p.1153"/>
stranger, and say, this man does not know in what
country he is; and though he has lived here so long,
he is ignorant of the laws and customs of the state,
and what is permitted and what not; nor has he
ever consulted any legal adviser, who might tell and
explain to him the laws. But no man writes a will
without knowing how it ought to be written, or consulting some one who knows; nor does he rashly
sign a bond, or give security. Yet he indulges his
desires and aversions, exerts his pursuits, intentions,
and resolutions, without consulting any legal adviser
about the matter.</p>
<p>" How do you mean, without a legal adviser? "</p>
<p>He knows not when he chooses what is not allowed
him, and does not choose what is necessary; and he
knows not what is his own, and what belongs to
others; for if he did know he would never be hindered, would never be restrained, would never be
anxious.</p>
<p>"How so?"
Why, does any one fear things that are not evils?
" No."</p>
<p>Does any one fear things that seem evils indeed,
but which it is in his own power to prevent?</p>
<p>" No, surely."</p>
<p>If, then, the things independent of our will are
neither good nor evil, and all things that do depend
on will are in our own power, and can neither be
taken away from us nor given to us unless we please,
<pb id="p.1154"/>
what room is there left for anxiety?  But we are
anxious about this paltry body or estate of ours, or
about what Caesar thinks, and not at all about anything internal. Are we ever anxious not to take up a
false opinion?  No; for this is within our own power.
Or not to follow any pursuit contrary to nature?
No, nor this. When, therefore, you see any one pale
with anxiety, just as the physician pronounces from
the complexion that such a patient is disordered in
the spleen, and another in the liver, so do you likewise say, this man is disordered in his desires and
aversions; he cannot walk steadily; he is in a fever.
70r nothing else changes the complexion, or causes
trembling, or sets the teeth chattering.

<p>Therefore <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">Antigonus Gonatas, king of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>, had so great an esteem for <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, that he often took a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> to visit
him, and endeavored, by magnificent promises, to allure him
to his court, but without success. He gave it as a reason for

appeared either mean or insolent. - C.</note> when he was to meet Antigonus,
felt no anxiety. For over that which he prized, Antigonus had no power; and those things over which
he had power, <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName> did not regard. But Antigonus
felt anxiety when he was to meet Zeno, and with
reason, for he was desirous to please him; and this
<pb id="p.1155"/>
was external ambition. But Zeno was not solicitous
to please Antigonus; for no one skilful in any art is
solicitous to please a person unskilful.</p>
<p>" I am solicitous to please you."</p>
<p>For what? Do you know the rules by which one
man judges of another? Have you studied to understand what a good and what a bad man is, and how
each becomes such? Why, then, are not you yourself
a good man?</p>
<p>" In what respect am I not? "</p>
<p>Because no good man laments or sighs or groans;
no good man turns pale and trembles and says,
" How will such a one receive me; how will he hear
me?"   As he thinks fit, foolish man. Why do you
trouble yourself about what belongs to others? Is it
not his fault if he receives you ill?</p>
<p>" Yes, surely."</p>
<p>And can one person be in fault and another the
sufferer?</p>
<p>" No."</p>
<p>Why, then, are you anxious about what belongs to
others?</p>
<p>"Well; but I am anxious how I shall speak to
him."</p>
<p>What, then; cannot you speak to him as you
will?</p>
<p>" But I am afraid I shall be disconcerted."</p>
<p>If you were going to write down the name of Dion,
should you be afraid of being disconcerted?
<pb id="p.1156"/></p>
<p>"By no means."</p>
<p>What is the reason?   Is it because you have
learned how to write?</p>
<p>Yes."</p>
<p>And if you were going to read, would it not be
exactly the same?</p>
<p>" Exactly."
What is the reason?</p>
<p>"Because every art gives a certain assurance and
confidence on its own ground."</p>
<p>Have you not learned, then, how to speak?  And
what else did you study at school?</p>
<p>" Syllogisms and convertible propositions."</p>
<p>For what purpose?  Was it not in order to talk
properly? And what is that but to talk seasonably
and discreetly and intelligently, and without flutter or
hesitation, and, by means of all this, with courage?</p>
<p>" Very true."</p>
<p>When, therefore, you go into the field on horseback, are you anxious on being matched against
one who is on foot, - you being practised and he
unpractised?</p>
<p>" Ay, but the person has power to kill me."</p>
<p>Then speak the truth, O unfortunate ! and be not
arrogant, nor take the philosopher upon you, nor conceal from yourself who are your masters; but while
you are thus to be held by the body, follow the
strongest.  <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, indeed, had studied how to
speak, who talked in such a manner to tyrants and
<pb id="p.1157"/>
judges, and in prison. Diogenes<note anchored="yes">When Diogenes was sailing to <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, he was taken by pirates, and carried to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and there exposed to sale. Being asked what he could do, he answered, "Govern men; " and pointing to a well-dressed Corinthian who was passing by, "Sell me," said he, "to him; for he wants a master." The Corinthian, whose name was Xeniades, bought him, and appointed him the tutor to his children; and Diogenes perfectly well discharged his trust. --C.</note>
had studied how
to speak, who talked in such a manner to Alexander,
to Philip, to the pirates, to the person who bought
him. This belonged to those who had studied the
matter; who had courage. But do you go where
you belong and remain there. Retire into some corner, and there sit and weave syllogisms, and propose
them to others. For there is not in you a man who

<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Concerning <placeName key="tgn,1045646">Naso</placeName>.</head>
<p>When a certain Roman came to him with his
son, and had heard one lesson, "This,"
said Epictetus, "is the method of teaching;" and
ceased. When the other desired him to go on, he
answered, Every art seems tedious, when it is delivered to a person ignorant and unskilful in it. The
things performed by the common arts quickly manifest the use for which they were made; and most
<pb id="p.1158"/>
of them have something attractive and agreeable.
Thus the trade of a shoemaker, as one seeks to learn
it, is an unpleasant thing; but the shoe is useful, and
not unpleasing to the eye. The trade of a smith is
extremely unattractive to an ignorant observer; but
the work shows the usefulness of the art. You will
see this much more strongly in music; for if you
stand by while a person is learning, it will appear to
you of all sciences the most unpleasant; but the
effects are agreeable and delightful, even to those who
do not understand it.</p>
<p>So here we take it to be the work of one who
studies philosophy, to bring his will into harmony with
events; so that none of the things which happen may
happen against our inclination, nor those which do
not happen be desired by us. Hence they who have
settled this point have it in their power never to be
disappointed in what they seek, nor to incur what
they shun; but to lead their own lives without sorrow,
fear, or perturbation, and in society to preserve all
the natural or acquired relations of son, father,
brother, citizen, husband, wife, neighbor, fellow-traveller, ruler, or subject. Something like this is what
we take to be the work of a philosopher.  It remains
to inquire, how it is to be effected.  Now ,e see that
a carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain
things; and a pilot, by learning certain. things, becomes a pilot. Probably, then, it is not sufficient, in
the present case, merely to be willing to be wise and
<pb id="p.1159"/>
good; but it is moreover necessary that certain things
should be learned. What these things are, is the question. The philosophers say that we are first to learn
that there is a God, and that his providence directs
the whole; and that it is not merely impossible to
conceal from him our actions, but even our thoughts
and emotions. We are next to learn what the gods
are; for such as they are found to be, such must he
seek to be to the utmost of his power, who would
please and obey them. If the Deity is faithful, he
too must be faithful; if free, beneficent, and noble, he
must be free, beneficent, and noble likewise, in all his
words and actions behaving as an imitator of God.</p>
<p>"Whence, then, are we to begin?"</p>
<p>If you will give me leave, I will tell you. It is necessary, in the first place, that you should understand
words.</p>
<p>"So then! I do not understand them now?"
No. You do not.
"How is it, then, that I use them?"</p>
<p>Just as the illiterate use the words of the learned,
and as brutes use the phenomena of nature. For use
is one thing, and understanding another. But if you
think you understand them, bring whatever words
you please, and let us see whether we understand
them or not.</p>
<p>"Well; but it is a grievous thing for a man to be
confuted who has grown old, and has perhaps served
through his three campaigns to a senatorship."
<pb id="p.1160"/></p>
<p>I know it very well. For you now come to me, as
if you wanted nothing. And how can it enter into
your imagination that there should be anything in
which you are deficient? You are rich; and perhaps
have a wife and children, and a great number of domestics. Caesar takes notice of you; you have many
friends at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; you render to all their dues; you
know how to requite a favor, and revenge an injury. In what are you deficient? Suppose, then, I
should prove to you that you are deficient in what
is most necessary and important to happiness; and
that hitherto you have taken care of everything,
rather than your duty; and to complete all, that
you understand not what God or man, or good or
evil, means? That you are ignorant of all the rest,
perhaps, you may bear to be told; but if I prove to
you that you are ignorant even of yourself, how will
you bear with me, and how will you have patience to
stay and be convinced? Not at all. You will immediately be offended, and go away. And yet what injury have I done you; unless a looking-glass injures
a person not handsome, when it shows him to himself such as he is; or unless a physician can be
thought to affront his patient, when he says to him:
"Do you think, sir, that you are not ill?  You have
a fever. Eat no meat to-day, and drink water "? Nobody cries out here, "What an intolerable affront! "
But if you say to any one: You exhibit feverishness
in your desires, and low habits in what you shun;
<pb id="p.1161"/>
your aims are contradictory, your pursuits not conformable to nature, your opinions rash and mistaken,
he presently goes away, and complains that he is
affronted.</p>
<p>This is the position we assume. As, in a crowded
fair, the horses and cattle are brought to be sold, and
most men come either to buy or sell; but there are a
few who come only to look at the fair, and inquire
how it is carried on, and why in that manner, and
who appointed it, and for what purpose, -thus, in
this fair [of the world] some, like cattle, trouble
themselves about nothing but fodder. To all of you
who busy yourselves about possessions and farms and
domestics and public posts, these things are nothing
else but mere fodder. But there are some few men
among the crowd who are fond of looking on, and
considering: "What then, after all, is the world?
Who governs it? Has it no governor? How is it
possible, when neither a city nor a house can remain,
ever so short a time, without some one to govern and
take care of it, that this vast and beautiful system
should be administered in a fortuitous and disorderly
manner? Is there then a governor?  Of what sort is
he, and how does he govern? And what are we who
are under him, and for what designed? Have we
some connection and relation to him, or none?  " In
this manner are the few affected, and apply themselves only to view the fair, and then depart. Well;
and they are laughed at by the multitude? Why, so
<pb id="p.1162"/>
are the lookers-on, by the buyers and sellers; and if
the cattle had any apprehension, they too would
laugh at such as admired anything but fodder.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Concerning those who obstinately persist in whatever they have determined.</head>
<p>Some, when they hear such discourses as these,</p>
<p>" That we ought to be steadfast; that the will is
by nature free and unconstrained; and that all else is
liable to restraint, compulsion, slavery, and tyranny,"
imagine that they must remain immutably fixed to
everything which they have determined. But it is
first necessary that the determination should be a
wise one. I agree that there should be sinews in the
body, but such as in a healthy, an athletic body; for
if you show me that you exhibit the [convulsed] sinews of a lunatic, and value yourself upon that, I will
say to you, Seek a physician, man; this is not muscular vigor, but is really enervation. Such is the
distemper of mind in those who hear these discourses
in a wrong manner; like an acquaintance of mine,
who, for no reason, had determined to starve himself
to death. I went the third day, and inquired what
was the matter. He answered, " I am determined."
Well; but what is your motive? For if your de-
<pb id="p.1163"/>
termination be right, we will stay, and assist your
departure; but, if unreasonable, change it. "We
ought to keep our determinations."  What do you
mean, sir? Not all of them; but such as are right.
Else, if you should fancy that it is night, if this be
your principle, do not change, but persist, and say,
"We ought to keep to our determinations."  What
do you mean, sir? Not to all of them. Why do you
not begin by first laying the foundation, inquiring
whether your determination be a sound one or not,
and then build your firmness and constancy upon it.
For if you lay a rotten and crazy foundation, you
must not build; since the greater and more weighty
the superstructure, the sooner will it fall. Without
any reason, you are withdrawing from us, out of life,
a friend, a companion, a fellow-citizen both of the
greater and the lesser city; and while you are committing murder, and destroying an innocent person,
you say, "We must keep to our determinations."
Suppose, by any means, it should ever come into
your head to kill me; must you keep such a
determination?</p>
<p>With difficulty this person was, however, at last
convinced; but there are some at present whom
there is no convincing. So that now I think I understand, what before I did not, the meaning of that
common saying, that a fool will neither bend nor
break. May it never fall to my lot to have a wise,
that is. an untractable, fool for my friend. " It is all
<pb id="p.1164"/>
to no purpose; I am determined." So are madmen
too; but the more strongly they are determined upon
absurdities, the more need have they of hellebore.
Why will you not act like a sick person, and apply
yourself to a physician? "Sir, I am  sick. Give
me your assistance; consider what I am to do. It is
my part to follow your directions." So say in the
present case: " I know not what I ought to do; and
I am come to learn."  " No; but talk to me about
other things; for upon <emph>this</emph> I am determined."  What
other things? What is of greater consequence, than
to convince you that it is not sufficient to be determined, and to persist? This is the vigor of a madman; not of one in health. " I will die, if you compel me to this."  Why so, man; what is the matter?
" I am determined." I have a lucky escape, that it
is not your determination to kill me. " I will not be
bribed [from my purpose]." Why so? " I am determined." Be assured, that with that very vigor
which you now employ to refuse the bribe, you may
hereafter have as unreasonable a propensity to take
it; and again to say, "I am determined."  As, in a
distempered and rheumatic body, the humor tends
sometimes to one part, sometimes to another; thus it
is uncertain which way a sickly mind will incline.
But if to its inclination and bent a spasmodic vigor
be likewise added, the evil then becomes desperate
and incurable.

<head>What we do not study to make use of the established principles concerning good and evil.</head>
<p>Where lies good?   In the will. Where evil?</p>
<p>In the will. Where neither good nor evil?
In things inevitable. What then? Does any one of
us remember these lessons out of the schools? Does
any one of us study how to answer for himself in the
affairs of life, as in common questions? " Is it day? "
"Yes."  "Is it night, then? "  "No."  "Is the
number of stars even?"  "I cannot tell."  When
a bribe is offered you, have you learned to make
the proper answer, that it is not a good?  Have you
exercised yourself in such answers as these, or only
in sophistries? Why do you wonder, then, that you
improve in points which you have studied; while in
those which you have not studied, there you remain
the same? When an orator knows that he has
written well, that he has committed to memory what
he has written, and that he brings an agreeable voice
with him, why is he still anxious? Because he is
not contented with what he has studied. What does
he want then? To be applauded by the audience.
He has studied the power of speaking, then; but he
has not studied censure and applause. For when did
he hear from any one what applause, what censure
<pb id="p.1166"/>
is?  What is the nature of each?  What kind of applause is to be sought, and what kind of censure to
be shunned? And when did he ever apply himself
to study what follows from these lessons? Why do
you wonder, then, if, in what he has learned, he excels others; but where he has not studied, he is the
same with the rest of the world?  Just as a musician
knows how to play, sings well, and has the proper dress
of his profession, yet trembles when he comes upon the
stage. For the first he understands; but what the
multitude is, or what mean the clamor and laughter of
the multitude, he does not understand. Nor does he
even know what anxiety itself is; whether it be our
own affair, or that of others; or whether it be possible
to suppress it, or not. Hence, if he is applauded, he
is puffed up when he makes his exit; but if he is
laughed at, the inflation is punctured, and subsides.</p>
<p>Thus are we too affected. What do we admire?
Externals. For what do we strive?  Externals.
And are we then in any doubt why we fear and
are anxious?  What is the consequence, then, when
we esteem the things that are brought upon is to
be evils?  We cannot but fear; we cannot but be
anxious. And then we say, " O Lord God, how shall
I avoid anxiety!"  Have you not hands, foolish
man? Has not God made them for you? You
might as well kneel and pray to be cured of your
catarrh. Take care of your disease, rather; and do
not murmur. Well; and has he given you nothing in
<pb id="p.1167"/>
the present case?  Has he not given you patience?
Has he not given you magnanimity? Has he not
given you fortitude? When you have such hands as
these, do you still seek for aid from another? But
we neither study nor regard these things. For give
me but one who cares how he does anything, who
does not regard the mete success of anything, but
his own manner of acting. Who, when he is walking,
regards his own action? Who, when he is deliberating, prizes the deliberation itself, and not the success that is to follow it? If it happens to succeed,
he is elated, and cries, "How  prudently have we
deliberated ! Did not I tell you, my dear friend, that
it was impossible, when we considered about anything,
that it should not happen right? " But if it miscarries,
the poor wretch is dejected, and knows not what to
say about the matter. Who among us ever, for such
a purpose, consulted a diviner? Who of us ever
slept in a temple, to be instructed [in a dream] concerning his manner of acting? I say, who? Show
me one who is truly noble and ingenuous, that I may
see what I have long sought. Show me either a
young or an old man.</p>
<p>Why, then, are we still surprised, if, when we waste
all our attention on the mere materials of action, we
are, in the manner of action itself, low, sordid, unworthy, timid, wretched, and altogether failures? For
we do not care about these things, nor make them
our study. If we had feared, not death or exile, but
<pb id="p.1168"/>
fear itself, we should have studied not to fall into
what appears to us to be evil. But as the case now
stands, we are eager and loquacious in the schools;
and when any little question arises about any of these
things, we are prepared to trace its consequences;
but drag us into practice, and you will find us miserably shipwrecked. Let something of alarming aspect
attack us, and you will perceive what we have been
studying, and in what we are exercised. Besides,
through this negligence we always exaggerate, and
represent things greater than the reality. In a voyage, for instance, casting my eyes down upon the
ocean below, and looking round me, and seeing no
land, I am beside myself, and imagine that, if I should
be shipwrecked, I must swallow all that ocean; not
does it occur to me, that. three pints are enough for
me. What is it, then, that alarms me,- the ocean?
No; but my own impressions. Again, in an earthquake I imagine the city is going to fall upon me;
but is not one little stone enough to knock my brains
out? What is it, then, that oppresses and makes us
beside ourselves?  Why, what else but our own impressions? For what is it, but mere impressions, that
distress him who leaves his country, and is separated
from his acquaintance and friends and place and
usual manner of life? When children cry, if their
nurse happens to be absent for a little while, give
them a cake, and they forget their grief. Shall we
compare you to these children, then?
<pb id="p.1169"/></p>
<p>" No, indeed. For I do not desire to be pacified by
a cake, but by right impressions. And what are they?  "</p>
<p>Such as a man ought to study all day long, so as
not to be absorbed in what does not belong to him, -
neither friend, place, nor academy, nor even his own
body; but to remember the law, and to have that
constantly before his eyes. And what is the divine
law? To preserve inviolate what is properly our own;
not to claim what belongs to others; to use what is
given us, and not desire what is not given us; and
when anything is taken away, to restore it readily,
and to be thankful for the time you have been permitted the use of it; and not cry after it, like a child
for its nurse and its mamma. For what does it signify what gets the better of you, or on what you
depend? Which is the worthier, one crying for a
doll, or for an academy? You lament for the portico
and the assembly of young people, and such entertainments. Another comes lamenting that he must
no longer drink the water of Dirce.<note anchored="yes">A beautiful clear river in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, flowing into the Ismenus. The Marcian water was conveyed by Ancus Marcius to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. -C.</note> Why, is not the
Marcian water as good?  " But I was used to that."
And in time you will be used to the other. And
when you are attached to this too, you may weep
again, and set yourself, in imitation of Euripides, to
celebrate, in verse</p>
<l>The baths of Nero, and the Marcian water.
<pb id="p.1170"/></l>
<p>Hence see the origin of Tragedy, when trifling accidents befall foolish men. "Ah, when shall I see
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and the citadel again?"  Foolish man, are
not you contented with what you see every day?
Can you see anything better than the sun, the moon,
the stars, the whole earth, the sea? But if, besides,
you comprehend him who administers the whole,
and carry him about within yourself, do you still long
after certain stones and a fine rock? What will you
do then, when you are to leave even the sun and
moon? Will you sit crying, like an infant?  What,
then, have you been doing in the school? What did
you hear? What did you learn? Why have you
written yourself down a philosopher, instead of writing
the real fact?  "I have prepared some abstracts, and
read over Chrysippus; but I have not so much as approached the door of philosophy. For what pretensions have I in common with Socrates, who died and
who lived in such a manner; or with Diogenes? " Do
you observe either of these crying, or out of humor,
that he is not to see such a man, or such a woman;
nor to live any longer at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> nor at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>; but
at <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>, for instance, or <placeName key="tgn,7002115">Ecbatana</placeName>? For does he stay
and repine, who may at any time, if he will, quit the
entertainment, and play no longer? Why does he not
stay, as children do, so long as he is amused? Such
a one, no doubt, will bear perpetual banishment and a
sentence of death wonderfully well ! Why will not you
be weaned, as children are; and take more solid food?
<pb id="p.1171"/>
Will you never cease to cry after your mammas and
nurses, whom the old women about you have taught
you to bewail?  " But if I go away, I shall trouble
them also." You trouble them ! No; it will not be
you; but that which troubles you too, -a mere impression. What have you to do then? Rid yourself
of that impression; and if they are wise, they will do
the same for theirs; or if not, they must lament for
themselves.</p>
<p>Boldly make a desperate push, man, as the saying
is, for prosperity, for freedom, for magnanimity. Lift
up your head at last, as being free from slavery.
Dare to look up to God, and say, "Make use of me
for the future as Thou wilt. I am of the same mind;
I am one with Thee. I refuse nothing which seems
good to Thee. Lead me whither Thou wilt. Clothe
me in whatever dress Thou wilt. Is it Thy will that I
should be in a public or a private condition; dwell
here, or be banished; be poor, or rich? Under all
these circumstances I will testify unto Thee before
men. I will explain the nature of every dispensation." No? Rather sit alone, then, in safety, and
wait till your mamma comes to feed you. If Hercules
had sat loitering at home, what would he have been?
Eurystheus, and not Hercules. Besides, by travelling
through the world, how many acquaintances and how
many friends he made. But none more his friend
than God; for which reason he was believed to be
the son of God, and was so. In obedience to him,
<pb id="p.1172"/>
he went about extirpating injustice and lawless force.
But you are not Hercules, nor able to extirpate the
evils of others; nor even Theseus, to extirpate the
evils of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. Extirpate your own then. Expel,
instead of Procrustes and Sciron,<note anchored="yes">Two famous robbers who infested <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. and were at last killed by Theseus. - C.</note> grief, fear, desire,
envy, malevolence, avarice, effeminacy, intemperance.
But these can be no otherwise expelled than by looking up to God alone, as your pattern; by attaching
yourself to him alone, and being consecrated to his
commands. If you wish for anything else, you will,
with sighs and groans, follow what is stronger than
you; always seeking prosperity without, and never
able to find it. For you seek it where it is not, and
neglect to seek it where it is.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<head>How to apply general principles to particular cases.</head>
<p>What is the first business of one who studies
philosophy? To part with self-conceit. For
it is impossible for any one to begin to learn what he
thinks that he already knows. We all go to the philosophers, talking at random upon negative and positive duties; good and evil; fair and base. We praise,
<pb id="p.1173"/>
censure, accuse; we judge and dispute about fair and
base enterprises. And yet for what do we go to the
philosophers? To learn what we suppose ourselves
not to know. And what is this? Propositions. We
are desirous to hear what the philosophers say, for its
elegance and acuteness; and some with a view only
to gain. Now it is ridiculous to suppose that a person will learn anything but what he desires to learn;
or make an improvement, in what he does not learn.
But most are deceived, in the same manner as Theopompus, the orator, when he blames Plato for defining everything. "For," he says, "did none of us, before you, use the words 'good' and 'just;' or did we
utter them as empty sounds, without understanding
what each of them meant?"   Why, who tells you,
Theopompus, that we had not natural ideas and general principles as to each of these?  But it is not possible to apply principles in detail, without having
minutely distinguished them, and examined what details appertain to each. You may make the same objection to the physicians. For who of us did not use
the words 'wholesome' and 'unwholesome,' before
Hippocrates was born; or did we utter them as empty
sounds? For we have some general conception of
what is wholesome too, but we cannot apply it.
Hence one says, let the patient abstain from meat;
another, give it to him. One says, let him be bled;
another, cup him. And what is the reason, but not
being able to adapt the general conception of whole-
<pb id="p.1174"/>
someness to particular cases? Thus, too, in life; who
of us does not talk of good or evil, advantageous and
disadvantageous; for who of us has not a general conception of each of these? But is it then a distinct
and perfect one? Show me this.</p>
<p>" How shall I show it? "</p>
<p>Apply it properly in detail. Plato, to go no further, puts definitions under the general head of useful; but you, under that of useless. Can both of
you be right? How is it possible?  Again, does not
one man adapt the general conception of good to
riches; another not to riches, but to pleasure or
health? In general, unless we who use words employ
them vaguely, or without proper care in discrimination, why do we differ?  Why do we wrangle?  Why
do we censure each other? But what occasion have I
to mention this mutual contradiction? If you yourself apply your principles properly, how comes it to
pass that you do not prosper? Why do you meet
with any hindrance? Let us for the present omit
our second point concerning the <emph>pursuits</emph> and the
duties relative to them; let us omit the third too,
concerning <emph>assent</emph>. I waive all these for you. Let
us insist only on the first,<note anchored="yes">The topic of the <emph>Desires</emph> and <emph>Aversions</emph>. - C.</note> which affords almost a
sensible proof that you do not properly apply your
principles. You desire what is possible in itself, and
possible for you. Why then are you hindered? Why
are you not in a prosperous way? You do not shrink
<pb id="p.1175"/>
from the inevitable. Why then do you incur anything
undesirable? Why are you unfortunate? When you
desire anything, why does it not happen? When you
do not desire it, why happens it? For this is the
greatest proof of ill success and misery: "I desire
something and it does not happen; and what is more
wretched than I?" From such impatience Medea
came to murder her own children, - a lofty action in
this point of view alone, that she had a proper impression of what it was to fail of one's aim. "Thus I
shall punish him who has injured and dishonored
me; and what is so wicked a wretch good for? But
how is this to be effected? I will murder the children; but that will be punishing myself. And what
care I? " This is the error of a powerful soul. For
she knew not where the fulfilment of our desires is to
be found; that it is not to be had from without, nor by
altering the appointment of things. Do not demand
the man for your husband, and then nothing which
you desire will fail to happen. Do not desire to keep
him to yourself. Do not desire to stay at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>,
and, in a word, have no will but the will of God,
and who shall restrain you; who shall compel you,
any more than Zeus? When you have such a guide,
and conform your will and inclinations to his, why
need you fear being disappointed? Fix your desire
and aversion on riches or poverty; the one will be
disappointed, the other incurred. Fix them on health.
power, honors, your country, friends, children, - in
<pb id="p.1176"/>
short, on anything beyond the control of your will, -
you will be unfortunate. But fix them on Zeus, on
the gods; give yourself up to these; let these govern; let your powers be ranged on the same side
with these, and how can you be any longer unprosperous? But if, poor wretch, you envy, and pity,
and are jealous, and tremble, and never cease a
single day from complaining of yourself and the
gods, why do you boast of your education? What
education, man, - that you have learned syllogisms?
Why do not you, if possible, unlearn all these, and
begin again, convinced that hitherto you have not
even touched upon the essential point? And for the
future, beginning from this foundation, proceed in order to the superstructure; that nothing may happen
which you do not wish, and that everything may
happen which you desire. Give me but one young
man who brings this intention with him to the
school, who is a champion for this point, and says,
" I yield up all the rest; it suffices me, if once I become able to pass my life free from hindrance and
grief, to stretch out my neck to all events as freely,
and to look up to Heaven as the friend of God, fearing nothing that can happen." Let any one of you
show himself of such a disposition, that I may say,
"Come into the place, young man, that is of right
your own; for you are destined to be an ornament to
philosophy. Yours are these possessions; yours these
books; yours these discourses." Then, when he has
<pb id="p.1177"/>
thoroughly mastered this first class, let him come to
me again and say, "I desire indeed to be free from
passion and perturbation; but I desire too, as a
pious, a philosophic, and a diligent man, to know
what is my duty to God, to my parents, to my relations, to my country, and to strangers." Come into the second class too; for this likewise is yours.
" But I have now sufficiently studied the second class
too; and I would willingly be secure and unshaken
by error and delusion, not only when awake, but
even when asleep; when warmed with wine; when
diseased with the spleen." You are becoming as a
god, man; your aims are sublime!</p>
<p>"Nay; but I, for my part, desire to understand
what Chrysippus says, in his logical treatise of the
Pseudomenos."<note anchored="yes">The " Pseudomenos " was a famous problem among the
Stoics, and it is this. When a person says, <emph>lie</emph>, does he lie,
or does he not?  If he lies, he speaks truth; if he speaks
truth, he lies. Chrysippus wrote six books upon it.- C.</note> Go  hang yourself, pitiful man,
with only such an aim as this! What good will it
do you? You will read the whole, lamenting all the
while; and say to others, trembling, "Do as I do.
Shall I read to you, my friend, and you to me?
You write amazingly well; and you very finely imitate the style of Plato; and you, of Xenophon; and
you, of Antisthenes." And thus, having related your
dreams to each other, you return again to the same
state.  Your desires and aversions, your pursuits,
<pb id="p.1178"/>
your intentions, your resolutions, your wishes, and
endeavors are just what they were. You do not so
much as seek for one to advise you, but are offended
when you hear such things as these, and cry, "An
ill-natured old man! He never wept over me, when
I was setting out, nor said, To what a danger are
you going to be exposed? If you come off safe,
child, I will illuminate my house. This would have
been the part of a man of feeling." Truly it will be
a mighty happiness if you do come off safe; it will
be worth while to make an illumination. For you
ought to be immortal and exempt from sickness, to
be sure.</p>
<p>Throwing away, then, I say, this self-conceit, by
which we fancy we have gained some knowledge of
what is useful, we should come to philosophic reasoning as we do to mathematics and music; otherwise
we shall be far from making any improvement, even
if we have read over all the compends and commentaries, not only of Chrysippus, but of Antipater, and
Archedemus too.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<head>How to deal with the semblances of things.</head>
<p>Every habit and faculty is preserved and increased by correspondent actions; as the habit
of walking, by walking; of running, by running. If
<pb id="p.1179"/>
you would be a reader, read; if a writer, write. But
if you do not read for a month together, but do something else, you will see what will be the consequence.
So after sitting still for ten days, get up and attempt
to take a long walk, and you will find how your legs
are weakened. Upon the whole, then, whatever you
would make habitual, practise it; and if you would
not make a thing habitual, do not practise it, but
habituate yourself to something else.</p>
<p>It is the same with regard to the operations of the
soul. Whenever you are angry, be assured that it
is not only a present evil, but that you have increased
a habit, and added fuel to a fire. When you are overcome by the seductions of a woman, do not consider
it as a single defeat alone, but that you have fed, that
you have increased, your dissoluteness. For it is impossible but that habits and faculties must either be
first produced, or strengthened and increased, by corresponding actions. Hence the philosophers derive
the growth of all maladies. When you once desire
money, for example, if reason be applied to produce
a sense of the evil, the desire ceases, and the governing faculty of the mind regains its authority; whereas,
if you apply no remedy, it returns no more to its
former state, but being again similarly excited, it
kindles at the desire more quickly than before; and
by frequent repetitions at last becomes callous, and
by this malady is the love of money fixed. For he
who has had a fever, even after it has left him, is not
<pb id="p.1180"/>
in the same state of health as before, unless he was
perfectly cured; and the same thing happens in
distempers of the soul likewise. There are certain
traces and blisters left in it, which, unless they are
well effaced, whenever a new hurt is received in the
same part, instead of blisters will become sores.</p>
<p>If you would not be of an angry temper, then, do
not feed the habit. Give it nothing to help its increase. Be quiet at first and reckon the days in
which you have not been angry. I used to be angry
every day; now every other day; then every third
and fourth day; and if you miss it so long as thirty
days, offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to God. For
habit is first weakened and then entirely destroyed.
"I was not vexed to-day, nor the next day, nor for
three or four months after; but restrained myself
under provocation." Be assured that you are in an
excellent way. " To-day, when I saw a handsome person, I did not say to myself, Oh. that I could possess
her! and how happy is her husband " (for he who
says this, says too, how happy is her gallant), "nor
did I go on to fancy her in my arms." On this I
stroke my head and say, Well done, Epictetus; thou
hast solved a hard problem, harder than the chief syllogism. But if the lady herself should happen to be
willing and give me intimations of it, and send for
me and press my hand and place herself next to me,
and I should then forbear and get the victory, -
that would be a triumph beyond all the forms of logic.
<pb id="p.1181"/>
This is the proper subject for exultation, and not one's
power in handling the syllogism.</p>
<p>How then is this to be effected? Be willing to
approve yourself to yourself. Be willing to appear
beautiful in the sight of God; be desirous to converse in purity with your own pure mind, and with
God; and then, if any such semblance bewilders you,
Plato directs you: "Have recourse to expiations;
go a suppliant to the temples of the averting deities."
It is sufficient, however, if you propose to yourself
the example of wise and good men, whether alive or
dead, and compare your conduct with theirs. Go to
Socrates, and see him placed beside his beloved, yet
not seduced by youth and beauty. Consider what a
victory he was conscious of obtaining; what an Olympic triumph ! How near does he rank to Hercules !<note anchored="yes">Hercules is said to have been the author of the gymnastic games, and the first victor. Those who afterwards conquered in wrestling, and the pancratium, were numbered from him. - C.</note>
So that, by Heaven! one might justly salute him, Hail !
wondrous victor !<note anchored="yes">This pompous title was given to those who had been victors in all the Olympic games. - C.</note> instead of those sorry boxers and
wrestlers, and the gladiators who resemble them.</p>
<p>By placing such an example before you, you will
conquer any alluring semblance, and not be drawn
away by it. But in the first place, be not hurried
away by excitement; but say, Semblance, wait for
me a little. Let me see what you are, and what you
represent. Let me try you. Then, afterwards, do
<pb id="p.1182"/>
not suffer it to go on drawing gay pictures of what
will follow; if you do, it will lead you wherever it
pleases. But rather oppose to it some good and noble semblance, and banish this base one. If you are
habituated to this kind of exercise, you will see what
shoulders, what nerves, what sinews, you will have.
But now it is mere trifling talk, and nothing more.
He is the true athlete who trains himself to deal with
such semblances as these. Stay, wretch, do not be
hurried away. The combat is great, the achievement
divine,- for empire, for freedom, for prosperity, for
tranquillity. Remember God. Invoke him for your
aid and protector, as sailors do Castor and Pollux,
in a storm. For what storm is greater than that
which arises from these perilous semblances, contending to overset our reason? Indeed what is the storm
itself, but a semblance? For do but take away the
fear of death, and let there be as many thunders
and lightnings as you please, you will find that to
the reason all is serenity and calm; but if you are
once defeated, and say, you will get the victory another time, and then the same thing over again;
assure yourself that you will at last be reduced to
so weak and wretched a condition, you will not so
much as know when you do amiss; but you will
even begin to make defences for your behavior, and
thus verify the saying of Hesiod:-
<cit><quote><l>With constant ills, the dilatory strive.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hes. WD 383">Works and Days, v. 383. -H.</bibl></cit>

<head>Concerning those who embrace philosophy only in words.</head>
<p>The science of "the ruling argument"<note anchored="yes">A logical subtlety. -H.</note> appears
to have its rise from hence. Of the following
propositions, any two imply a contradiction to the
third. They are these: "That everything past is
necessarily true;" "that an impossibility is not the
consequence of a possibility;" and, "that something is a possibility, which neither is nor will be
true." Diodorus, perceiving this contradiction, combined the first two, to prove that nothing is possible,
which neither is nor will be true. Some again hold
the second and third,-"that something is possible,
which neither is nor will be true;" and "that an
impossibility is not the consequence of a possibility; "
and consequently assert, "that not everything past
is necessarily true." This way Cleanthes and his
followers took; whom Antipater copiously defends.
Others, lastly, maintain the first and third,-"that
something is possible; which neither is nor will be
true;" and "that everything past is necessarily
true; " but then, "that an impossibility may be the
consequence of a possibility." But all these three
<pb id="p.1184"/>
propositions cannot be at once maintained, because
of their mutual contradiction.</p>
<p>If any one should ask me, then, which of them I
maintain, I answer him, that really I cannot tell.
But I have heard it related that Diodorus held one
opinion about them; the followers of Panthaedes, I
think, and Cleanthes, another; and Chrysippus a
third.</p>
<p>"What then is your opinion? "</p>
<p>I express none. I was born to examine things as
they appear to my own mind; to compare what is
said by others, and thence to form some conviction
of my own on any topic. Of these things I have
merely technical knowledge. Who was the father
of Hector?  Priam. Who were his brothers?  <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>
and Deiphobus. Who was his mother? Hecuba.
this I have heard related. From whom? Homer.
But I believe Hellanicus, and other authors, have
written on the same subject. And what better account have I of "the ruling argument"? But, if I
were vain enough, I might, especially at some entertainment, astonish all the company by an enumeration
of authors relating to it. Chrysippus has written
wonderfully, in his first Book of Possibilities. Cleanthes and Archedemus have each written separately
on this subject. Antipater too has written, not only
in his Treatise of Possibilities, but especially in a discourse on "the ruling argument." Have you not
read the work?  "No."   Read it then. And what
<pb id="p.1185"/>
good will it do him? He will be more trifling and
impertinent than he is already. For what else have
you gained by reading it? What conviction have
you formed upon this subject? But you tell us of
Helen, and Priam, and the isle of Calypso, something which never was, nor ever will be. And in
these matters, indeed, it is of no great consequence
if you retain the story, without forming any principle of your own. But we commit this error much
more in dealing with moral questions, than upon such
subjects as these.</p>
<p>" Talk to me concerning good and evil."
Hear: -
<cit><quote>Winds blew from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> to Ciconian shores.</quote> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.39">Homer, Odyssey, ix. 39.</bibl></cit>
The expression became proverbial, signifying " from bad to worse." - H.</p>
<p>Some things are good, some evil, and some indifferent. Now the good are the virtues, and whatever
partakes of them; and the evil are vices, and what
partakes of vice; the indifferent lie between these,
as riches, health, life, death, pleasure, pain.</p>
<p>"Whence do you know this?"</p>
<p>[Suppose I say] Hellanicus says it, in his Egyptian History. For what does it signify, whether one
quotes the history of Hellanicus, or the ethics of
Diogenes, or Chrysippus, or Cleanthes? Have you
then examined any of these things, and formed convictions of your own? How, for instance, would you
<pb id="p.1186"/>
conduct yourself on shipboard? Remember these
distinctions, when the mast rattles, and some idle
fellow stands by you while you are screaming, and
says: " For heaven's sake ! talk as you did a little
while ago. Is it vice to suffer shipwreck; or does
it partake of vice?"  Would you not take up a log,
and throw it at his head?  "What have we to do
with you, sir? We are perishing, and you come and
jest."  Again, if Caesar should summon you to answer an accusation, remember these distinctions. If,
when you are going in, pale and trembling, any one
should meet you and say, "Why do you tremble, sir?
What is this affair you are engaged in? Does Caesar,
within there, give virtue and vice to those who approach him?"   "What, do <emph>you</emph> too insult me, and
add to my evils?"   "Nay, but tell me, philosopher, why you tremble. Is there any other danger, but death, or a prison, or bodily pain, or exile,
or slander?" "Why, what else should there be?"
"Are any of these vice; or do they partake of vice?
What, then, did you yourself use to say of these
things? "  "What have you to do with me, sir?
My own evils are enough for me." You say rightly.
Your own evils are indeed enough for you; your
baseness, your cowardice, and that arrogance by
which you were elated, as you sat in the schools.
Why did you assume plumage not your own? Why
did you call yourself a Stoic?</p>
<p rend="right">Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you
<pb id="p.1187"/>
will find of what sect you are. You will find that
most of you are Epicureans; a few are Peripatetics,
and those but loose ones. For by what action will
you prove that you think virtue equal, and even superior, to all other things?  Show me a Stoic, if you have
one. Where? Or how should you? You can show,
indeed, a thousand who repeat the Stoic reasonings.
But do they repeat the Epicurean less well? Are
they not just as perfect in the Peripatetic? Who then
is a Stoic? As we call that a Phidian statue which
is formed according to the art of Phidias, so show
me some one person formed according to the principles which he professes. Show me one who is sick,
and happy; in danger, and happy; dying, and happy;
exiled, and happy; disgraced, and happy. Show him
to me; for, by Heaven ! I long to see a Stoic. But
you have not one fully developed? Show me then
one who is developing; one who is approaching towards this character. Do me this favor. Do not refuse an old man a sight which he has never yet seen.
Do you suppose that you are to show the Zeus or
Athena of Phidias, a work of ivory or gold?  Let any
of you show me a human soul desiring to be in unity
with God; not to accuse either God or man; not to
be disappointed of its desire, nor incur its aversion;
not to be angry; not to be envious; not to be jealous;
in a word, desiring from a man to become a god;
and, in this poor mortal body, aiming to have fellowship with Zeus. Show him to me. But you cannot.
<pb id="p.1188"/>
Why then do you impose upon yourselves, and play
tricks with others? Why do you put on a dress not
your own, and walk about in it, mere thieves and
pilferers of names and things which do not belong to
you?  I am now your preceptor, and you come to be
instructed by me. And indeed my aim is to secure
you from being restrained, compelled, hindered; to
make you free, prosperous, happy; looking to God
upon every occasion, great or small. And you come
to learn and study these things. Why then do you
not finish your work, if you have the proper aims,
and I, besides the aim, the proper qualifications?
What is wanting? When I see an artificer, and the
materials lying ready, I await the work. Now here
is the artificer; here are the materials; what is it we
want?  Is not the thing capable of being taught?  It
is. Is it not in our own power, then? The only thing
of all others that is so. Neither riches nor health
nor fame nor, in short, anything else is in our power
except a right use of the semblances of things. This
alone is, by nature, not subject to restraint, not subject to hindrance. Why then do not you finish it?
Tell me the cause. It must be my fault, or yours, or
from the nature of the thing. The thing itself is practicable, and the only thing in our power. The fault
then must be either in me or in you, or, more truly,
in both. Well, then, shall we at length begin to carry
such an aim with us? Let us lay aside all that is past.
Let us begin. Only believe me, and you shall see.

<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<head>Concerning the Epicureans and Academics.</head>
<p>Things true and evident must, of necessity, be
recognized even by those who would contradict
them. And perhaps one of the strongest proofs that
there is such a thing as evidence is the necessity
which compels even those who contradict it to make
use of it. If a person, for instance, should deny that
anything is universally true, he will be obliged to assert the contrary, that nothing is universally true.
Foolish man, not so. For what is this but an universal statement?<note anchored="yes">Translation conjectural. - H.</note> Again, suppose any one should
come and say, " Know that there is nothing to be
known; but all things are uncertain; " or another,
" Believe me, for your good, that no man ought to be
believed in anything;" or a third, "Learn from me
that nothing is to be learned; I tell you this, and
will teach the proof of it, if you please."  Now what
difference is there between such as these, and those
who call themselves Academics, - who say to us, " Be
convinced that no one ever is convinced; believe us,
that nobody believes anybody "?</p>
<p>Thus also, when Epicurus would destroy the natural tie between mankind, he makes use of the very
<pb id="p.1190"/>
thing he is destroying. For what says he?  "Be
not deceived; be not seduced and mistaken. There
is no natural tie between reasonable beings. Believe
me. Those who say otherwise mislead and impose
upon you." Why are you concerned for us then?
Let us be deceived. You will fare never the worse,
if all the rest of us are persuaded that there is a natural tie between mankind, and that it is by all means
to be preserved. Nay, it will be much safer and better. Why do you give yourself any trouble about us,
sir? Why do you break your rest for us?  Why do
you light your lamp?  Why do you rise early?  Why
do you compose so many volumes? Is it that none
of us should be deceived concerning the gods, as if
they took any care of men; or that we may not
suppose the essence of good consists in anything
but in pleasure?  For if these things be so, lie down
and sleep, and lead the life of which you judge yourself worthy, - that of a mere worm. Eat, drink, debauch, snore. What is it to you, whether others think
rightly or wrongly about these things? For what
have you to do with us? You take care of sheep,
because they afford their milk, their wool, and at
last their flesh. And would it not be a desirable
thing that men might be so lulled and enchanted by
the Stoics as to give themselves up to be milked
and fleeced by you, and such as you? Should not
these doctrines be taught to your brother Epicureans
only, and concealed from the rest of the world; who
<pb id="p.1191"/>
should by all means, above all things, be persuaded
that we have a natural tie with each other, and that
self-command is a good thing, in order that all may
be kept safe for <emph>you</emph>?  Or is this tie to be preserved
towards some and not towards others? Towards
whom, then, is it to be preserved,--towards such as
mutually preserve, or such as violate it? And who
violate it more than you, who teach such doctrines?</p>
<p>What was it, then, that waked Epicurus from his
sleep, and compelled him to write what he did; what
else, but that which is of all influences the most powerful among mankind, Nature; which draws every
one, however unwilling and reluctant, to its own purposes. For since, she says, you think that there is
no tie between mankind, write out this doctrine, and
leave it for the use of others; and break your sleep
upon that account; and by your own practice confute your own principles. Do we say that Orestes
was roused from sleep because driven by the furies;
and was not Epicurus waked by sterner furies and
avengers, which would not suffer him to rest, but
compelled him to utter his own ills, as wine and madness do the priests of Cybele? So strong and unconquerable a thing is human nature ! For how can a
vine have the properties not of a vine, but of an olivetree; or an olive-tree not those of an olive-tree, but
of a vine? It is impossible. It is inconceivable. Neither, therefore, is it possible for a human creature entirely to lose human affections. But even those who
<pb id="p.1192"/>
have undergone a mutilation cannot have their inclinations also mutilated; and so Epicurus, when he
had mutilated all the offices of a man, of a master of
a family, of a citizen, and of a friend, did not mutilate the inclinations of humanity; for this he could
not do, any more than the idle Academics can throw
away or blind their own senses, though this be the
point they chiefly labor. What a misfortune is it,
when any one, after having received from Nature
standards and rules for the knowledge of truth, does
not strive to add to these, and make up their deficiencies; but, on the contrary, endeavors to take away and
destroy whatever truth may be known even by them.</p>
<p>What say you, philosopher? What do you think
of piety and sanctity? "If you please, I will prove
that they are good." Pray do prove it; that our
citizens may be converted, and honor the Deity, and
may no longer neglect what is of the highest importance. " Do you accept these demonstrations, then? "
I have, and I thank you. "Since you are so well
pleased with this, then, learn these contrary propositions: that there are no gods, or, if there are,
that they take no care of mankind, neither have we
any concern with them; that this piety and sanctity,
so much talked of by many, are only an imposition of
boasting and sophistical men, or perhaps of legislators, for a terror and restraint to injustice." Well
done, philosopher. Our citizens are much the better
for you. You have already brought back all the
<pb id="p.1193"/>
youth to a contempt of the Deity.  "What! does
not this please you, then? Learn next, that justice
is nothing; that shame is folly; that the paternal relation is nothing; the filial, nothing. " Well said, philosopher; persist, convince the youth; that we may
have many more to think and talk like you. By
such doctrines as these, no doubt, have our well-governed states flourished ! Upon these was <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>
founded ! Lycurgus, by his laws and method of
education, introduced such persuasions as these:
that it is not base to be slaves, rather than honorable; nor honorable to be free, rather than base!
They who died at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>, died from such principles as these ! And from what other doctrines did
the Athenians leave their city?<note anchored="yes">When the Athenians found themselves unable to resist the forces of the Persians, they left their city; and having removed their wives and children, and their movable effects, to <placeName key="tgn,5004287">Troezen</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, went on board their ships, and defended the liberty of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> by their fleet. - C.</note></p>
<p>And yet they who talk thus marry, and produce
children, and engage in public affairs, and get themselves made priests and prophets. Of whom? Of
gods that have no existence. And they consult the
Pythian priestess, only to hear falsehoods, and interpret the oracles to others. Oh, monstrous impudence
and imposture !</p>
<p>What are you doing, man? <note anchored="yes">What follows is against the Academics, who denied the evidence of the senses.-C.</note> You contradict your-
<pb id="p.1194"/>
self every day; and you will not give up these paltry
cavils. When you eat, where do you put your hand, -
to your mouth, or to your eye? When you bathe,
where do you go? Do you ever call a kettle a dish,
or a spoon a spit? If I were a servant to one of
these gentlemen, were it at the hazard of being flayed
every day, I would plague him. "Throw some oil
into the bath, boy." I would take pickle, and pour
upon his head. "W hat is this?"  Really, sir, I was
impressed by a certain semblance so like oil as not to
be distinguished from it. "Give me the soup."  I
would carry him a dish full of vinegar. "Did I
not ask for the soup?"  Yes, sir; this is the soup.
"Is not this vinegar?" Why so, more than soup?
"Take it and smell it, take it and taste it." How do
you know, then, but our senses deceive us? If I had
three or four fellow-servants to join with me, I would
make him either choke with passion and burst, or
change his opinions. But now they insult us by
making use of the gifts of nature, while in words
they destroy them. Those must be grateful and
modest men, at least, who, while eating their daily
bread, dare to say, "We do not know whether there
be any such beings as Demeter, or Core, or Pluto."
Not to mention that while they possess the blessings
of night and day, of the annual seasons, of the stars,
the earth, and the sea, they are not the last affected
by any of these things; but only study to give out
some idle problem, and when they have thus relieved
<pb id="p.1195"/>
themselves, go and bathe; but take not the least care
what they say, nor on what subjects, nor to whom,
nor what may be the consequence of their talk,-
whether any well-disposed young man, on hearing
such doctrines, may not be affected by them, and so
affected as entirely to lose the seeds of his good disposition; whether they may not furnish an adulterer
with occasions of growing shameless in his guilt;
whether a public plunderer may not find excuses
from these doctrines; whether he, who neglects his
parents, may not gain an additional confidence from
them.</p>
<p>"What things, then, in your opinion, are good and
evil, fair and base,- such things, or such things?"
But why should one argue any more with such as
these, or interchange opinions, or endeavor to convince them? By Zeus ! one might sooner hope to
convince the most unnatural debauchees, than those
who are thus deaf and blind to their own ills.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Of inconsistency.</head>
<p>There are some things which men confess with
ease, and others with difficulty. No one, for
instance, will confess himself a fool or a blockhead;
but, on the contrary, you will hear every one say, "I
<pb id="p.1196"/>
wish my fortune were in proportion to my abilities."
But they easily confess themselves fearful, and say,
"I am somewhat timorous, I confess; but in other
respects you will not find me a fool." No one will
easily confess himself intemperate in his desires,
upon no account dishonest, nor indeed very envious
or meddling; but many confess themselves to have
the weakness of being compassionate. What is the
reason of all this? The principal reason is an inconsistency and confusion in what relates to good and
evil. But different people have different motives,
and in general, whatever they imagine to be base,
they do not absolutely confess. Fear and compassion they imagine to belong to a well-meaning disposition; but stupidity, to a slave. Offences against
society they do not own; but in most faults they
are brought to a confession chiefly from imagining
that there is something involuntary in them, as in
fear and compassion. And though a person should
in some measure confess himself intemperate in his
desires, he accuses his passion, and expects forgiveness, as for an involuntary fault. But dishonesty is
not imagined to be, by any means, involuntary. In
jealousy too there is something they suppose involuntary and this likewise, in some degree, they confess.</p>
<p>Conversing therefore with such men, thus confused, thus ignorant what they say, and what are or
are not their ills, whence they have them, and how
they may be delivered from them, it is worth while,
<pb id="p.1197"/>
I think, to ask one's self continually, "Am I too one
of these? What do I imagine myself to be?  How
do I conduct myself, - as a prudent, as a temperate
man? Do I, too, ever talk at this rate,- that I am
sufficiently instructed for what may happen? Have I
that persuasion that I know nothing which becomes
one who knows nothing? Do I go to a master as
to an oracle, prepared to obey; or do I also, like a
mere driveller, enter the school only to learn and understand books which I did not understand before,
or perhaps to explain them to others?"</p>
<p>You have been fighting at home with your manservant; you have turned the house upside-down,
and alarmed the neighborhood; and do you come to
me with a pompous show of wisdom, and sit and criticise how I explain a sentence, how I prate whatever
comes into my head? Do you come, envious and
dejected that nothing has come from home for you,
and in the midst of the disputations sit thinking on
nothing but how your father or your brother may treat
you? "What are they saying about me at home?
Now they think I am improving, and say, He will
come back with universal knowledge. I wish I could
learn everything before my return; but this requires
much labor, and nobody sends me anything. The
baths are very bad at <placeName key="tgn,7011016">Nicopolis</placeName>; and things go very
ill both at home and here."</p>
<p>After all this, it is said, nobody is the better for the
philosophic school. Why, who comes to the school?
<pb id="p.1198"/>
I mean, who comes to be reformed; who, to submit his principles to correction; who, with a sense of
his wants? Why do you wonder, then, that you
bring back from the school the very thing you carried there? For you do not come to lay aside, or
correct, or change, your principles. How should you?
Far from it. Rather consider this, therefore, whether
you have not what you have come for. You have
come to talk about theorems. Well; and are you not
more impertinently talkative than you were? Do
not these paltry theorems furnish you with matter
for ostentation? Do you not solve convertible and
hypothetical syllogisms? Why, then, are you still
displeased, if you have the very thing for which you
came?</p>
<p>"Very true; but if my child or my brother should
die; or if I must die or be tortured myself, what
good will these things do me?  " Why, did.you come
for <emph>this</emph>?  Did you attend upon me for <emph>this</emph>?  Was it
upon any such account that you ever lighted your
lamp, or sat up at night? Or did you, when you
went into the walk, propose any delusive semblance
to your own mind to be discussed, instead of a syllogism?   Did any of you ever go through such a
subject jointly? And after all, you say, theorems are
useless. To whom? To such as apply them ill.
For medicines for the eyes are not useless to those
who apply them when and as they ought. Fomentations are not useless, dumb-bells are not useless:
<pb id="p.1199"/>
but they are useless to some, and on the contrary,
useful to others. If you should ask me, now, are
syllogisms useful? I should answer that they are
useful; and, if you please, I will show you how.
"Will they be of service to me, then?" Why, did
you ask, man, whether they would be useful to <emph>you</emph>,
or in general? If any one in a dysentery should ask
me whether acids be useful, I should answer, they
are. "Are they useful for <emph>me</emph>, then?" I say, no.
First try to get the flux stopped, and the ulceration healed. Do you too first get your ulcers healed,
your fluxes stopped. Quiet your mind, and bring it
free from distraction to the school; and then you
will know what force there is in reasoning.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Of friendship.</head>
<p>To whatever objects a person devotes his attention, these objects he probably loves. Do men
ever devote their attention, then, to [what they think]
evils? By no means. Or even to things indifferent?
No, nor this. It remains, then, that good must be the
sole object of their attention; and if of their attention, of their love too. Whoever, therefore, understands good, is capable likewise of love; and he
who cannot distinguish good from evil, and things
<pb id="p.1200"/>
indifferent from both, how is it possible that he can
love? The wise person alone, then, is capable of
loving.</p>
<p>" How so? I am not this wise person, yet I love
my child."</p>
<p>I protest it surprises me that you should, in the
first place, confess yourself unwise. For in what are
you deficient?  Have not you the use of your senses?
Do you not distinguish the semblances of things?
Do you not provide such food and clothing and habitation as are suitable to you?  Why then do you confess that you want wisdom? In truth, because you
are often struck and disconcerted by semblances,
and their speciousness gets the better of you; and
hence you sometimes suppose the very same things
to be good, then evil, and lastly, neither; and, in a
word, you grieve, you fear, you envy, you are disconcerted, you change. Is it from this that you confess
yourself unwise? And are you not changeable too
in love?  Riches, pleasure, in short, the very same
things, you sometimes esteem good, and at other times
evil. And do you not esteem the same persons too
alternately as good and bad, at one time treating
them with kindness, at another with enmity; at one
time commending, and at another censuring them?</p>
<p>"Yes. This too is the case with me."</p>
<p>Well, then; can he who is deceived in another be
his friend, think you?</p>
<p>"No, surely."
<pb id="p.1201"/></p>
<p>Or does he who loves him with a changeable affection bear him genuine good-will?</p>
<p>" Nor he, neither."
Or he who now vilifies, then admires him?</p>
<p>" Nor he."</p>
<p>Do you not often see little dogs caressing and playing with each other, so that you would say nothing
could be more friendly? But to learn what this friendship is, throw a bit of meat between them, and you
will see. Do you too throw a bit of an estate betwixt
you and your son, and you will see that he will
quickly wish you under ground, and you him; and
then you, no doubt, on the other hand will exclaim,
What a son have I brought up ! He would bury me
alive ! Throw in a pretty girl, and the old fellow
and the young one will both fall in love with her;
or let fame or danger intervene, the words of the
father of Admetus will be yours:--
<cit><quote lang="en"><l>You love to see the light. Doth not your father?</l>
<l>You fain would still behold it. Would not he? </l></quote> <bibl n="Eur. Alc. 701">Euripides, Alcestis, v. [691] 701.</bibl></cit> The second line, as
quoted by Epictetus, is not found in the received editions.
Pheres, the father of Admetus, is defending himself for not
consenting to die in place of his son. - H.</p>
<p>Do you suppose that he did not love his own child
when it was little; that he was not in agonies when
it had a fever, and often wished to undergo that
fever in its stead? But, after all, when the trial comes
<pb id="p.1202"/>
home, you see what expressions he uses. Were not
Eteocles and Polynices born of the same mother and
of the same father?  Were they not brought up,
and did they not live and eat and sleep, together?
Did not they kiss and fondle each other? So that
any one, who saw them, would have laughed at all
the paradoxes which philosophers utter about love.
And yet when a kingdom, like a bit of meat, was
thrown betwixt them, see what they say,-
<cit><quote><sp><speaker>Polynices</speaker><l>Where wilt thou stand before the towers?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Eteocles</speaker><l>Why askest thou this of me?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pol.</speaker><l>I will oppose myself to thee, to slay thee.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Et.</speaker><l>Me too the desire of this seizes. </l></sp></quote> <bibl n="Eur. Phoen. 630">Euripides, Phoenissae 630-631.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Such are the prayers they offer. Be not therefore
deceived. No living being is held by anything so
strongly as by its own needs. Whatever therefore
appears a hindrance to these, be it brother or father
or child or mistress or friend, is hated, abhorred,
execrated; for by nature it loves nothing like its own
needs. This motive is father and brother and family and country and God. Whenever, therefore, the
gods seem to hinder this, we vilify even them, and
throw down their statues, and burn their temples;
as Alexander ordered the temple of Esculapius to be
burnt, because he had lost the man he loved.</p>
<p>When, therefore, any one identifies his interest with
those of sanctity, virtue, country, parents, and friends,
<pb id="p.1203"/>
all these are secured; but whenever he places his
interest in anything else than friends, country, family, and justice, then these all give way, borne down
by the weight of self-interest. For wherever I and
<emph>mine</emph> are placed, thither must every living being
gravitate. If in body, that will sway us; if in our
own will, that; if in externals, these. If, therefore,
I rest my personality in the will, then only shall I be
a friend, a son, or a father, such as I ought. For in
that case it will be for my interest to preserve the
faithful, the modest, the patient, the abstinent, the
beneficent character; to keep the relations of life
inviolate. But if I place my personality in one thing,
and virtue in another, the doctrine of Epicurus will
stand its ground, that virtue is nothing, or mere
opinion.</p>
<p>From this ignorance it was that the Athenians and
Lacedemonians quarrelled with each other, and the
Thebans with both; the Persian king with <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
and the Macedonians with both; and now the Romans with the Getes. And in still remoter times
the Trojan war arose from the same cause. Alexander [<placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>] was the guest of Menelaus; and whoever
had seen the mutual proofs of good-will that passed
between them would never have believed that they
were not friends.  But a tempting bait, a pretty
woman, was thrown in between them; and thence
came war. At present, therefore, when you see that
dear brothers have, in appearance, but one soul do
<pb id="p.1204"/>
not immediately pronounce upon their love; not
though they should swear it, and affirm it was impossible to live asunder. For the governing faculty of a
bad man is faithless, unsettled, undiscriminating, successively vanquished by different semblances. But
inquire, not as others do, whether they were born of
the same parents, and brought up together, and
under the same preceptor; but this thing only, in
what they place their interest,- in externals or in
their own wills. If in externals, you can no more
pronounce them friends, than you can call them
faithful, or constant, or brave, or free; nay, nor even
truly men, if you are wise. For it is no principle of
humanity that makes them bite and vilify each other,
and take possession of public assemblies, as wild
beasts do of solitudes and mountains; and convert
courts of justice into dens of robbers; that prompts
them to be intemperate, adulterers, seducers; or leads
them into other offences that men commit against
each other, - all from that one single error, by which
they risk themselves and their own concerns on
things uncontrollable by will.</p>
<p>But if you hear that these men in reality suppose
good to be placed only in the will, and in a right use
of things as they appear, no longer take the trouble
of inquiring if they are father and son, or old companions and acquaintances; but boldly pronounce
that they are friends, and also that they are faithful
and just. For where else can friendship be met, but
<pb id="p.1205"/>
joined with fidelity and modesty, and the intercommunication of virtue alone?</p>
<p>"Well; but such a one paid me the utmost regard
for so long a time, and did he not love me? "</p>
<p>How can you tell, foolish man, if that regard be
any other than he pays to his shoes, or his horse,
when he cleans them? And how do you know but
that when you cease to be a necessary utensil, he may
throw you away, like a broken stool?</p>
<p>"Well; but it is my wife, and we have lived
together many years."</p>
<p>And how many did Eriphyle live with Amphiaraus, and was the mother of children not a few?
But a bauble came between them. What was this
bauble? A false conviction concerning certain things.
This turned her into a savage animal; this cut asunder all love, and suffered neither the wife nor the
mother to continue such.<note anchored="yes">Amphiaraus married Eriphyle, the sister of Adrastus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7010720">Argos</placeName>, and was betrayed by her for a golden chain.-- C.</note></p>
<p>Whoever, therefore, among you studies either to
be or to gain a friend, let him cut up all false convictions by the root, hate them, drive them utterly out
of his soul. Thus, in the first place, he will be secure
from inward reproaches and contests, from vacillation and self-torment. Then, with respect to others,
to every like-minded person he will be without disguise; to such as are unlike he will be patient, mild,
gentle, and ready to forgive them, as failing in points
<pb id="p.1206"/>
of the greatest importance; but severe to none, being
fully convinced of Plato's doctrine, that the soul is
never willingly deprived of truth. Without all this,
you may, in many respects, live as friends do; and
drink and lodge and travel together, and even be
born of the same parents; and so may serpents too;
but neither they nor you can ever be really friends,
while your accustomed principles remain brutal and
execrable.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Of eloquence.</head>
<p>A book will always be read with more pleasure
and ease, if it be written in fair characters;
and so every one will the more easily attend to discourses likewise, if ornamented with proper and beautiful expressions. It ought not then to be said, that
there is no such thing as the faculty of eloquence; for
this would be at once the part of an impious and
timid person, - impious, because he dishonors the gifts
of God; just as if he should deny any use in the
faculties of sight, hearing, and speech itself. Has
God then given you eyes in vain? Is it in vain that
he has infused into them such a strong and active
spirit as to be able to represent the forms of distant
objects? What messenger is so quick and diligent?
Is it in vain that he has made the intermediate air
<pb id="p.1207"/>
so yielding and elastic that sight penetrates through
it? And is it in vain that he has made the light,
without which all the rest would be useless? Man,
be not ungrateful, nor, on the other hand, unmindful
of your superior advantages; but for sight and hearing, and indeed for life itself, and the supports of it,
as fruits and wine and oil, be thankful to God; but
remember that he has given you another thing, superior to them all, which uses them, proves them,
estimates the value of each. For what is it that pronounces upon the value of each of these faculties?
Is it the faculty itself? Did you ever perceive the
faculty of sight or hearing to say anything concerning itself; or wheat, or barley, or horses, or dogs?
No. These things are appointed as instruments and
servants, to obey that which is capable of using things
as they appear. If you inquire the value of anything, of what do you inquire? What is the faculty
that answers you? How then can any faculty be
superior to this, which uses all the rest as instruments, and tries and pronounces concerning each of
them?   For which of them knows what itself is, and
what is its own value?  Which of them knows when
it is to be used, and when not? Which is it that
opens and shuts the eyes, and turns them away from
improper objects?  Is it the faculty of sight?  No;
but that of Will. Which is it that opens and shuts
the ears? Which is it by which they are made curious and inquisitive, or, on the contrary, deaf, and
<pb id="p.1208"/>
unaffected by what is said?  Is it the faculty of hearing? No; but that of Will. This, then, recognizing
itself to exist amidst other faculties, all blind and
deaf, and unable to discern anything but those offices
in which they are appointed to minister and serve,
itself alone sees clearly, and distinguishes the value
of each of the rest. Will this, I say, inform us that
anything is supreme but itself? What can the eye,
when it is opened, do more than see? But whether
we ought to look upon the wife of any one, and in
what manner, what is it that decides us? The faculty of Will. Whether we ought to believe, or disbelieve what is said; or whether, if we do believe, we
ought to be moved by it, or not, what is it that
decides us? Is it not the faculty of Will? Again,
the very faculty of eloquence, and that which ornaments discourse, if any such peculiar faculty there
be, what does it more than merely ornament and
arrange expressions, as curlers do the hair? But
whether it be better to speak or to be silent, or
better to speak in this or in that manner, whether
this be decent or indecent, and the season and use
of each, what is it that decides for us, but the faculty
of Will? What, then; would you have it appear, and
bear testimony against itself? What means this?
If the case be thus, then that which serves may be
superior to that to which it is subservient; the horse
to the rider, the dog to the hunter, the instrument
to the musician, or servants to the king. What is
<pb id="p.1209"/>
it that makes use of all the rest?  The Will. What
takes care of all? The Will. What destroys the
whole man, at one time, by hunger; at another, by a
rope or a precipice? The Will. Has man, then,
anything stronger than this? And how is it possible
that what is liable to restraint should be stronger than
what is not? What has a natural power to restrain
the faculty of sight? The Will and its workings.
And it is the same with the faculties of hearing and
of speech. And what has a natural power of restraining the Will? Nothing beyond itself, only its
own perversion. Therefore in the Will alone is vice;
in the Will alone is virtue.</p>
<p>Since, then, the Will is such a faculty, and placed
in authority over all the rest, suppose it to come forth
and say to us that the body is of all things the most
excellent! If even the body itself pronounced itself
to be the most excellent, it could not be borne. But
now, what is it, Epicurus, that pronounces all this?
What was it that composed volumes concerning " the
End," " the Nature of things," "the Rule;" that assumed a philosophic beard; that as it was dying
wrote that it was " then spending its last and happiest
day "? 1 Was this the body, or was it the faculty of
Will? And can you, then, without madness, admit
<note anchored="yes">These words are part of a letter written by Epicurus, when
he was dying, to one of his friends. Diog. Laert. 10.22. -C.
<p>The titles previously given are those of treatises by Epicurus. - H.</p></note>
<pb id="p.1210"/>
anything to be superior to this? Are you in reality
so deaf and blind? What, then; does any one dishonor the other faculties? Heaven forbid! Does
any one assert that there is no use or excellence in the
faculty of sight? Heaven forbid ! It would be stupid,
impious, and ungrateful to God. But we render to
each its due. There is some use in an ass, though
not so much as in an ox; and in a dog, though not
so much as in a servant; and in a servant, though not
so much as in the citizens; and in the citizens,
though not so much as in the magistrates. And
though some are more excellent than others, those
uses which the last afford are not to be despised.
The faculty of eloquence has thus its value, though
not equal to that of the Will. When therefore I talk
thus, let not any one suppose that I would have you
neglect eloquence, any more than your eyes, or ears,
or hands, or feet, or clothes, or shoes. But if you
ask me what is the most excellent of things, what shall
I say? I cannot say eloquence, but a right Will;
for it is this which makes use of that and of all
the other faculties, whether great or small. If this
be set right, a bad man becomes good; if it be
wrong, a good man becomes wicked. By this we
are unfortunate or fortunate; we disapprove or
approve each other. In a word, it is this which,
neglected, forms unhappiness; and, well cultivated,
happiness.</p>
<p>But to take away the faculty of eloquence, and to
<pb id="p.1211"/>
say that it is in reality nothing, is not only ungrateful
to those who gave it, but cowardly too. For such a
person seems to me to be afraid that, if there be any
such faculty, we may on occasion be compelled to respect it. Such are they too, who deny any difference
between beauty and deformity. Was it possible, then,
to be affected in the same manner by seeing Thersites,
as by Achilles; by Helen, as by any other woman?
These also are the foolish and clownish notions of
those who are ignorant of the nature of things, and
afraid that whoever perceives such a difference must
presently be carried away and overcome. But the
great point is to leave to each thing its own proper
faculty, and then to see what the value of that faculty
is; to learn what is the principal thing, and upon every
occasion to follow that, and to make it the chief object of our attention; to consider other things as
trifling in comparison with this, and yet, so far as we
are able, not to neglect even these. We ought, for
instance, to take care of our eyes; yet not as of the
principal thing, but only on account of that which is
principal; because that can no otherwise preserve its
own nature, than by making a due estimate of the
rest, and preferring some to others. What is the
usual practice, then?  That of a traveller who, returning into his own country, and meeting on the way
with a good inn, being pleased with the inn, should
remain there. Have you forgotten your intention,
man? You were not travelling to this place, but only
<pb id="p.1212"/>
through it. "But this is a fine place." And how many
other fine inns are there, and how many pleasant
fields, yet they are simply as a means of passage. What
is the real business? To return to your country; to
relieve the anxieties of your family; to perform the
duties of a citizen; to marry, have children, and go
through the public offices. For you did not travel in
order to choose the finest places; but to return, to
live in that where you were born, and of which you
are appointed a citizen.</p>
<p>Such is the present case. Because, by speech and
such instruction, we are to perfect our education and
purify our own will and rectify that faculty which
deals with things as they appear; and because, for
the statement of theorems, a certain diction, and some
variety and subtilty of discourse are needful, many,
captivated by these very things, -one by diction,
another by syllogisms, a third by convertible propositions, just as our traveller was by the good inn, - go
no further, but sit down and waste their lives shamefully there, as if amongst the sirens. Your business,
man, was to prepare yourself for such use of the
semblances of things as nature demands; not to fail
in what you seek, or incur what you shun; never to
be disappointed or unfortunate, but free, unrestrained,
uncompelled; conformed to the Divine Administration, obedient to that; finding fault with nothing,
but able to say, from your whole soul, the verses which
begin,
<pb id="p.1213"/>
<cit><quote><l>Conduct me, Zeus; and thou, O Destiny.</l></quote> <bibl>A Fragment of Cleanthes, quoted in full in Enchiridion, c. 52.- H.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>While you have such a business before you, will you
be so pleased with a pretty form of expression, or a
few theorems, as to choose to stay and live with them,
forgetful of your home, and say, "They are fine
things!"  Why, who says they are not fine things?
But only as a means; as an inn. For what hinders
one speaking like Demosthenes from being miserable?
What hinders a logician equal to Chrysippus from
being wretched, sorrowful, envious, vexed, unhappy?
Nothing. You see, then, that these are merely unimportant inns, and what concerns you is quite another
thing. When I talk thus to some, they suppose that
I am setting aside all care about eloquence and about
theorems; but I do not object to that, only the
dwelling on these things incessantly, and placing our
hopes there. If any one, by maintaining this, hurts
his hearers, place me amongst those hurtful people;
for I cannot, when I see one thing to be the principal
and most excellent, call another so to please you.

<head>Concerning a person whom he treated with disregard.</head>
<p>When a certain person said to him, "I have
often come to you with a desire of hearing you,
and you have never given me any answer; but now, if
possible, I entreat you to say something to me," -
Do you think, replied Epictetus, that as in other things,
so in speaking, there is an art by which he who understands it speaks skilfully, and he who does not
unskilfully?</p>
<p>" I do think so."</p>
<p>He, then, who by speaking both benefits himself,
and is able to benefit others, must speak skilfully;
but he who injures and is injured, must be unskilful
in this art. For you may find some speakers injured,
and others benefited. And are all hearers benefited
by what they hear?  Or will you find some benefited,
and some hurt?</p>
<p>" Both."</p>
<p>Then those who hear skilfully are benefited, and
those who hear unskilfully, hurt.</p>
<p>" Granted."</p>
<p>Is there any art of hearing, then, as well as of
speaking?
<pb id="p.1215"/></p>
<p>" It seems so."</p>
<p>If you please, consider it thus. To whom think you
that the practice of music belongs?</p>
<p>" To a musician."</p>
<p>To whom the proper formation of a statue?</p>
<p>"To a sculptor."</p>
<p>And do you not imagine some art necessary even to
view a statue skilfully?</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>If, therefore, to speak properly belongs to one who
is skilful, do you not see that to hear profitably belongs likewise to one who is skilful? For the present, however, if you please, let us say no more of
doing things perfectly and profitably, since we are
both far enough from anything of that kind; but this
seems to be universally confessed, that he who would
hear philosophers needs some kind of exercise in
hearing. Is it not so? Tell me, then, on what I
shall speak to you. On what subject are you able
to hear me?</p>
<p>" On good and evil."</p>
<p>The good and evil of what, - of a horse?</p>
<p>" No."</p>
<p>Of an ox?</p>
<p>" No."</p>
<p>What, then; of a man?</p>
<p>" Yes."</p>
<p>Do we know, then, what man is; what is his nature, what our idea of him, and how far our ears are
<pb id="p.1216"/>
open in this respect to him? Nay, do you understand what Nature is; or are you able in any degree
to comprehend me when I come to say, " But I must
use demonstration to you "? How should you? Do
you comprehend what demonstration is, or how a
thing is demonstrated, or by what methods; or what
resembles a demonstration, and yet is not a demonstration? Do you know what true or false is; what
is consequent upon anything, and what contradictory;
suitable, or dissonant? But I must excite you to
study philosophy. How shall I show you that contradiction among the generality of mankind, by which
they differ concerning good and evil, profitable and
unprofitable, when you know not what <emph>contradiction</emph>
means? Show me, then, what I shall gain by discoursing with you? Excite an inclination in me, as
a proper pasture excites an inclination to eating, in a
sheep; for if you offer him a stone or a piece of
bread, he will not be excited. Thus we too have certain natural inclinations to speaking, when the hearer
appears to be somebody, when he gives us encouragement; but if he sits by like a stone or a tuft of grass,
how can he excite any desire in a man? Does a vine
say to an husbandman, "Take care of me"?  No;
but invites him to take care of it, by showing him
that, if he does, it will reward him for his care. Who
is there, whom bright and agreeable children do not
attract to play, and creep, and prattle with them?
But who was ever taken with an inclination to divert
<pb id="p.1217"/>
himself or bray with an ass; for be the creature ever
so little, it is still a little ass.</p>
<p>"Why then do you say nothing to me?"</p>
<p>I have only this to say to you; that whoever is utterly ignorant what he is and wherefore he was born,
and in what kind of a universe and in what society;
what things are good and what evil, what fair and
what base; who understands neither discourse nor
demonstration, nor what is true nor what is false,
nor is able to distinguish between them; such a one
will neither exert his desires, nor aversions, nor pursuits conformably to Nature; he will neither aim,
nor assent, nor deny, nor suspend his judgment conformably to Nature; but will wander up and down,
entirely deaf and blind, supposing himself to be somebody, while he is nobody. Is there anything new in
all this? Is not this ignorance the cause of all the
errors that have happened, from the very origin of
mankind? Why did Agamemnon and Achilles differ? Was it not for want of knowing what is advantageous, what disadvantageous? Does not one of
them say it is advantageous to restore Chryseis to
her father; the other, that it is not? Does not one
say that he ought to take away the prize of the
other; the other, that he ought not? Did they not
by these means forget who they were, and for what
purpose they had come there? Why, what did you
come for, man, - to win mistresses, or to fight?
"To fight."   With whom, - Trojans or Greeks?
<pb id="p.1218"/>
"With the Trojans."  Leaving Hector, then, do you
draw your sword upon your own king? And do you,
good sir, forgetting the duties of a king, -
<cit><quote><l>Intrusted with a nation and its cares,</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.25">Homer, Iliad, 2.25.</bibl></cit>
go to squabbling about a girl with the bravest of your
allies, whom you ought by every method to conciliate and preserve? And will you be inferior to a
subtle priest who pays his court anxiously to you fine
gladiators?  You see the effects produced by ignorance of what is truly advantageous.</p>
<p>" But I am rich, as well as other people." What,
richer than Agamemnon? "But I am   handsome
too."  What, handsomer than Achilles?   "But I
have fine hair too." Had not Achilles finer and
brighter? Yet he never combed it exquisitely, nor
curled it. "But I am  strong too."  Can you lift
such a stone, then, as Hector or Ajax?  "But I am
of a noble family too." Is your mother a goddess,
or your father descended from  Zeus?  And what
good did all this do Achilles, when he sat crying
for a girl? "But I am an orator." And was not
he? Do you not see how he treated the most eloquent of the Greeks, - Odysseus and Phoenix, - how
he struck them dumb? This is all I have to say to
you; and even this against my inclination.</p>
<p>"Why so?"
Because you have not excited me to it. For what
<pb id="p.1219"/>
can I see in you to excite me, as spirited horses their
riders?  Your person?  That you disfigure.  Your
dress? That is effeminate. Your behavior. Your
look? Absolutely nothing. When you would hear
a philosopher, do not say to him, "You tell me
nothing;" but only show yourself fit and worthy to
hear; and you will find how you will move him to
speak.</p></div2>

<head>That logic is necessary.</head>
<p>When one of the company said to him, "Convince me that logic is necessary," - Would
you have me, he said, demonstrate it to you? "Yes."
Then I must use a demonstrative form of argument.
"Granted."  And how will you know, then, whether
I argue sophistically?  On this, the man being silent,
You see, says he, that even by your own confession,

<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<head>What is the test of error.</head>
<p>Every error implies a contradiction; for since
he who errs does not wish to err, but to be in
the right, it is evident that he acts contrary to his
wish. What does a thief desire to attain? His own
interest. If, then, thieving be really against his interest, he acts contrary to his own desire. Now, every
rational soul is naturally averse to self-contradiction;
but so long as any one is ignorant that it is a contradiction, nothing restrains him from acting contradictorily; but whenever he discovers it, he must as
necessarily renounce and avoid it, as any one must
dissent from a falsehood whenever he perceives it to
be a falsehood; only while this does not appear, he
assents to it as to a truth.</p>
<p>He, then, is gifted in speech, and excels at once in
exhortation and conviction, who can disclose to each
man the contradiction by which he errs, and prove
clearly to him that what he would he doth not, and
what he would not, that he doth. For, if that be
shown, he will depart from it of his own accord; but,
till you have shown it, be not surprised that he remains where he is; for he proceeds on the semblance
of acting rightly. Hence Socrates, relying on this fac-
<pb id="p.1221"/>
ulty, used to say. "It is not my custom to cite any
other witness for my assertions; but I am always
contented with my opponent. I call and summon
him for my witness; and his single evidence serves
instead of all others." For he knew that if a rational soul be moved by anything, the scale must
turn whether it will or no. Show the governing faculty of Reason a contradiction, and it will renounce
it; but till you have shown it, rather blame yourself
than him who remains unconvinced.

<head>Of personal adornment.</head>
<p>A certain young rhetorician coming to him
with his hair too elaborately ornamented, and
his dress very fine, Tell me, said Epictetus, whether
you do not think some horses and dogs beautiful
and so of all other animals.</p>
<p>" I do."</p>
<p>Are some men, then, likewise beautiful, and others
deformed?</p>
<p>" Certainly."</p>
<p>Do we pronounce all these beautiful the same way,
then, or each in some way peculiar to itself?  You
will judge of it by this; since we see a dog naturally
formed for one thing, a horse for another, and a
nightingale, for instance, for another, therefore, in
general, it will be correct to pronounce each of them
<pb id="p.2002"/>
beautiful so far as it is developed suitably to its own
nature; but since the nature of each is different, I
think each of them must be beautiful in a different
way. Is it not so?</p>
<p>"Agreed."</p>
<p>Then what makes a dog beautiful makes a horse
deformed, and what makes a horse beautiful makes
a dog deformed, if their natures are different.</p>
<p>" So it seems."</p>
<p>For, I suppose, what makes a good Pancratiast<note anchored="yes">These are the names of combatants in the Olympic games. A Pancratiast was one who united the exercises of wrestling and boxing. A Pentathlete, one who contended on all the five games of Leaping, running, throwing the discus, darting, and wrestling. - C.</note>
makes no good wrestler, and a very ridiculous racer;
and the very same person who appears well as a Pentathlete might make a very ill figure in wrestling.</p>
<p>"Very true."</p>
<p>What, then, makes a man beautiful? Is it on the
same principle that a dog or a horse is beautiful?</p>
<p>"The same."
What is it, then, that makes a dog beautiful?</p>
<p>" That excellence which belongs to a dog."</p>
<p>What a horse?</p>
<p>"The excellence of a horse."</p>
<p>What a man? Must it not be the excellence belonging to a man? If, then, you would appear beautiful, young man, strive for human excellence.
<pb id="p.2003"/></p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>Consider whom you praise, when unbiassed by partiality; is it the honest or dishonest?</p>
<p>"The honest."</p>
<p>The sober or the dissolute?</p>
<p>"The sober."</p>
<p>The temperate or the intemperate?</p>
<p>" The temperate."</p>
<p>Then, if you make yourself such a character, you
know that you will make yourself beautiful; but
while you neglect these things, though you use every
contrivance to appear beautiful, you -must necessarily be deformed.</p>
<p>I know not how to say anything further to you;
for if I speak what I think, you will be vexed, and
perhaps go away and return no more. And if I do
not speak, consider what I am doing. You come to
me to be improved, and I do not improve you; and
you come to me as to a philosopher, and I do not
speak like a philosopher. Besides, how could it be
consistent with my duty towards yourself, to pass
you by as incorrigible? If, hereafter, you should
come to have sense, you will accuse me with reason: "What did Epictetus observe in me, that, when
he saw me come to him in such a shameful condition,
he overlooked it, and never said so much as a word
about it?  Did he so absolutely despair of me?  Was
I not young?  Was I not able to hear reason?  How
many young men, at that age, are guilty of many

say?-he was silent." I do not say like what;

yourself, and will know what it is, and who they
are who adopt such a dress.</p>
<p>If you should hereafter lay this to my charge, what
excuse could I make?  "Ay; but if I do speak, he
will not regard me."  Why, did Laius regard Apollo
Did not he go and get intoxicated, and bid farewell to
the oracle? What then? Did this hinder Apollo
from telling him the truth?  Now, I am uncertain
whether you will regard me or not; but Apollo positively knew that Laius would not regard him, and
yet he spoke.<note anchored="yes">Laius, king of <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>, petitioned Apollo for a son.

<p>Did Socrates prevail upon all who came to him, to
take care of themselves? Not upon the thousandth
part; but being, as he himself declares, divinely appointed to such a post, he never deserted it. What
said he even to his judges?  "If you would acquit
me, on condition that I should no longer act as I do
now, I would not accept it, nor desist; but I will accost all I meet, whether young or old, and interrogate
them in just the same manner; but particularly you,
my fellow-citizens, since you are more nearly related
to me."  " Are you so curious and officious, Socrates? What is it to you, how we act?"  "What say
you?  While you are of the same community and
the same kindred with me, will you be careless of
yourself, and show yourself a bad citizen to the city,
a bad kinsman to your kindred, and a bad neighbor
to your neighborhood?"   "Why, who are you?"

to take care of mankind." For it is not every little
paltry heifer that dares resist the lion; but if the
bull should come up, and resist him, would you say
to him, "Who are you? What business is it of
yours?" In every species, man, there is some one
quality which by nature excels, - in oxen, in dogs, in
bees, in horses.  Do not say to whatever excels,
"Who are you?"   If you do, it will, somehow or
other, find a voice to tell you, " I am like the purple
<pb id="p.2006"/>
thread in a garment. Do not expect me to be like
the rest; nor find fault with my nature, which has
distinguished me from others."</p>
<p>"What, then; am I such a one? How should I
be?"   Indeed, are you such a one as to be able
to hear the truth? I wish you were. But, however,
since I am condemned to wear a gray beard and a
cloak, and you come to me as a philosopher, I will
not treat you cruelly, nor as if I despaired of you;
but will ask you, Who is it, young man, whom you
would render beautiful? Know, first, who you are;
and then adorn yourself accordingly.</p>
<p>You are a human being; that is, a mortal animal,
capable of a rational use of things as they appear.
And what is this rational use? A perfect conformity
to Nature. What have you, then, particularly excellent? Is it the animal part? No. The mortal?
No. That which is capable of the mere use of these
things? No. The excellence lies in the rational
part. Adorn and beautify this; but leave your hair
to him who formed it as he thought good.</p>
<p>Well, what other appellations have you? Are you
a man or a woman? A man. Then adorn yourself
as a man, not as a woman. A woman is naturally
smooth and delicate, and if hairy, is a monster, and
shown among the monsters at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. It is the same
thing in a man <emph>not</emph> to be hairy; and if he is by
nature not so, he is a monster. But if he depilates
himself, what shall we do with him? Where shall
<pb id="p.2007"/>
we show him, and how shall we advertise him?
"A man to be seen, who would rather be a woman."
What a scandalous show! Who would not wonder at
such an advertisement? I believe, indeed, that these
very persons themselves would; not apprehending
that it is the very thing of which they are guilty.</p>
<p>Of what have you to accuse your nature, sir, that
it has made you a man? Why, were all to be born
women, then? In that case what would have been
the use of your finery? For whom would you have
made yourself fine, if all were women? But the whole
affair displeases you. Go to work upon the whole,
then. Remove your manhood itself and make yourself a woman entirely, that we may be no longer deceived, nor you be half man, half woman. To whom
would you be agreeable, -to the women? Be agreeable to them as a man.</p>
<p>"Ay; but they are pleased with fops."</p>
<p>Go hang yourself. Suppose they were pleased with
every debauchery, would you consent? Is this your
business in life? Were you born to please dissolute
women? Shall we make such a one as you, in the
Corinthian republic for instance, governor of the city,
master of the youth, commander of the army, or
director of the public games? Will you pursue the
same practices when you are married? For whom,
and for what? Will you be the father of children,
and introduce them into the state, such as yourself?</p>
<p>Oh, what a fine citizen, and senator, and orator!
<pb id="p.2008"/>
Surely, young man, we ought to pray for a succession
of young men disposed and bred like you!</p>
<p>Now, when you have once heard this discourse, go
home and say to yourself, It is not Epictetus who has
told me all these things, - for how should he?  - but
some propitious god through him; for it would never
have entered the head of Epictetus, who is not used
to dispute with any one. Well, let us obey God
then, that we may not incur the Divine displeasure.
If a crow has signified anything to you by his croaking, it is not the crow that signifies it, but God
through him. And if you have anything signified
to you through the human voice, doth he not cause
that man to tell it to you, that you may know the
Divine power which acts thus variously, and signifies
the greatest and principal things through the noblest
messenger? What else does the poet mean, when he
says, -
<cit><quote><l>Since we forewarned him,</l>
<l>Sending forth Hermes. watchful Argicide,</l>
<l>Neither to slay, nor woo another's wife.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.37">Homer, Odyssey, 1.37.</bibl></cit></p>
<p rend="left">Hermes, descending from heaven, was to warn him.
and the gods now, likewise, send a Hermes the
Argicide as messenger to warn you not to invert the
well-appointed order of things, nor be absorbed in
fopperies; but suffer a man to be a man, and a
woman to be a woman; a beautiful man to be beau-
<pb id="p.2009"/>
tiful as a man; a deformed man to be deformed as
a man; for your personality lies not in flesh and hair,
but in the Will. If you take care to have this beautiful, you will be beautiful. But all this while, I dare
not tell you that you are deformed; for I fancy you
would rather hear anything than this. But consider
what <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> says to the most beautiful and blooming of all men, Alcibiades. " Endeavor to make yourself beautiful."  What does he mean to say to him, -
"Curl your locks, and depilate your legs "? Heaven
forbid ! But rather, "Regulate your Will; throw away
your wrong principles."</p>
<p>" What is to be done with the poor body, then? "</p>
<p>Leave it to nature. Another hath taken care of
such things. Give them up to him.</p>
<p>"What, then; must one be a sloven? "</p>
<p>By no means; but act in conformity to your nature. A man should care for his body, as a man; a
woman, as a woman; a child, as a child. If not, let
us pick out the mane of a lion, that he may not be
slovenly; and the comb of a cock, for he too should
be tidy. Yes, but let it be as a cock: and a lion, as
a lion; and a hound. as a hound.

<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<head>In what a well-trained man  should  exercise himself; and that we neglect the principal things.</head>
<p>There are three topics in philosophy, in which
he who would be wise and good must be exercised: that of the <emph>desires</emph> and <emph>aversions</emph>, that he may
not be disappointed of the one, nor incur the other;
that of the <emph>pursuits</emph> and <emph>avoidances</emph>, and, in general,
the duties of life, that he may act with order and
consideration, and not carelessly; the third includes
integrity of mind and prudence, and, in general, whatever belongs to the judgment.</p>
<p>Of these points the principal and most urgent is
that which reaches the passions; for passion is produced no otherwise than by a disappointment of one's
desires and an incurring of one's aversions. It is this
which introduces perturbations, tumults, misfortunes,
and calamities; this is the spring of sorrow, lamentation, and envy; this renders us envious and emulous,
and incapable of hearing reason.</p>
<p>The next topic regards the duties of life. For I
am not to be undisturbed by passions, in the same
sense as a statue is; but as one who preserves the
natural and acquired relations, - as a pious person, as
. son, as a brother, as a father, as a citizen.
<pb id="p.2011"/></p>
<p>The third topic belongs to those scholars who are
now somewhat advanced; and is a security to the
other two, that no bewildering semblance may surprise us, either in sleep, or wine, or in depression.
This, say you, is beyond us. Yet our present philosophers, leaving the first and second topics, employ
themselves wholly about the third; dealing in the
logical subtilties. For they say that we must, by engaging in these subjects, take care to guard against
deception. Who must? A wise and good man. Is
this really, then, the thing you need? Have you mastered the other points? Are you not liable to be deceived by money? When you see a fine girl, do you
oppose the seductive influence?  If your neighbor inherits an estate, do you feel no vexation?  Is it not
steadfastness which you chiefly need? You learn
even these very things, slave, with trembling, and a
solicitous dread of contempt; and are inquisitive to
know what is said of you. And if any one comes
and tells you that, in a dispute as to which was the
best of the philosophers, one of the company named
a certain person as the only philosopher, that little
soul of yours grows to the size of two cubits instead
of an inch. But if another comes and says, "You
are mistaken, he is not worth hearing; for what does
he know? He has the first rudiments, but nothing
more," you are thunderstruck; you presently turn
pale, and cry out, "I will show what I am; that I
am a great philosopher." You exhibit by these very
<pb id="p.2012"/>
things what you are aiming to show in other ways.
Do not you know that Diogenes exhibited some sophist in this manner, by pointing with his middle finger; <note anchored="yes">Extending the middle finger, with the ancients, was a mark of the greatest contempt. -C.</note> and when the man was mad with rage, "This,"
said Diogenes, "is the very man; I have exhibited
him to you." For a man is not shown by the finger
in the same sense as a stone or a piece of wood, but
whoever points out his principles shows him as a man.</p>
<p>Let us see your principles too. For is it not evident that you consider your own Will as nothing, but
are always aiming at something beyond its reach?
As, what such a one will say of you, and what you
shall be thought, -whether a man of letters; whether
to have read Chrysippus or Antipater; and if Archedemus too, you have everything you wish. Why are
you still solicitous, lest you should not show us what
you are? Shall I tell you what you have shown yourself?  A mean, discontented, passionate, cowardly person, complaining of everything, accusing everybody,
perpetually restless, good for nothing. This you have
shown us. Go now and read Archedemus; and then,
if you hear but the noise of a mouse, you are a dead
man; for you will die some such kind of death as -
Who was it?  Crinis ;<note anchored="yes">Crinis was a Stoic philosopher. The circumstances of his death are not now known. - C.</note> who valued himself extremely
too, that he understood Archedemus.
<pb id="p.2013"/></p>
<p>Wretch, why do you not let alone things that do
not belong to you? These things belong to such as
are able to learn them without perturbation; who can
say, " I am not subject to anger, or grief, or envy. I
am not restrained; I am not compelled. What remains for me to do? I am at leisure; I am at ease.
Let us now see how logical inversions are to be
treated; let us consider, when an hypothesis is laid
down, how we may avoid a contradiction." To such
persons do these things belong. They who are safe
may light a fire, go to dinner if they please, and sing
and dance; but you are for spreading sail just when
your ship is going down.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<head>What is the chief concern of a good man; and in what we chiefly ought to train ourselves.</head>
<p>The chief concern of a wise and good man is his
own Reason. The body is the concern of a
physician, and of a gymnastic trainer; and the fields,
of the husbandman. The business of a wise and good
man is to use the phenomena of existence conformably to Nature. Now, every soul, as it is naturally
formed for an assent to truth, a dissent from falsehood, and a suspense of judgment with regard to
things uncertain, so it is moved by a desire of good,
<pb id="p.2014"/>
an aversion from evil, and an indifference to what is
neither good nor evil. For as a money-changer, or
a gardener, is not at liberty to reject Caesar's coin,
but when once it is shown is obliged, whether he
will or not, to deliver his wares in exchange for it,
so is it with the soul. Apparent good at first sight
attracts, and evil repels. Nor will the soul any more
reject an evident appearance of good, than Caesar's
coin.</p>
<p>Hence depends every movement, both of God and
man; and hence good is preferred to every obligation, however near. My connection is not with my
father; but with good.  Are you so hard-hearted?
Such is my nature, and such is the coin which God
hath given me. If therefore good is interpreted to
be anything but what is fair and just, away go father
and brother and country and everything.  What!
Shall I overlook my own good, and give it up to you?
For what? "I am your father." But not my good.
" I am your brother." But not my good. But if we
place it in a rightly trained Will, good must then consist in an observance of the several relations of life;
and then he who gives up mere externals acquires
good. Your father deprives you of your money; but
he does not hurt you. He will possess more land
than you, as much more as he pleases; but will he
possess more honor, more fidelity, more affection?
Who can deprive you of this possession?  Not even
Zeus; for he did not will it so, since he has put this
<pb id="p.2015"/>
good into my own power, and given it me, like his
own, uncompelled, unrestrained, and unhindered. But
when any one deals in, coin different from this, then
whoever shows it to him, may have whatever is sold
for it in return. A thievish proconsul comes into the
province. What coin does he use? Silver. Show it
him, and carry off what you please. An adulterer
comes. What coin does he use? Women. Take
the coin, says one, and give me this trifle. " Give it
me, and it is yours." Another is addicted to other
debauchery; give him but his coin, and take what you
please. Another is fond of hunting; give him a fine
pony or puppy, and he will sell you for it- what you
will, though it be with sighs and groans. For there is
that within which controls him, and assumes this to
be current coin.</p>
<p>In this manner ought every one chiefly to train
himself. When you go out in the morning, examine
whomsoever you see or hear; and answer as if to a
question. What have you seen? A handsome person. Apply the rule. Is this a thing controllable
by Will or uncontrollable? Uncontrollable. Then
discard it. What have you seen? One in agony for
the death of a child. Apply the rule. Death is inevitable. Banish this despair, then. Has a consul
met you? Apply the rule. What kind of thing is
the consular office, -controllable by Will or uncontrollable? Uncontrollable. Throw aside this too.
It will not pass. Cast it away; it is nothing to you.
<pb id="p.2016"/></p>
<p>If we acted thus, and practised in this manner from
morning till night, by Heaven! something would be
done. Whereas now, on the contrary, we are allured
by every semblance, half-asleep; and if we ever
awake, it is only a little in the school; but as soon
as we go out, if we meet any one grieving, we say,
" He is undone."  If a consul, " How happy is he! "
If an exile, " How miserable ! " If a poor man, " How
wretched  he has nothing to eat! "</p>
<p>These miserable prejudices, then, are to be lopped
off; and here is our whole strength to be applied.
For what is weeping and groaning? Prejudice. What
is misfortune? Prejudice. What is sedition, discord,
complaint, accusation, impiety, levity? All these are
prejudices, and nothing more; and prejudices concerning things uncontrollable by Will, as if they could
be either good or evil. Let any one transfer these
convictions to things controllable by Will, and I will
engage that he will preserve his constancy, whatever
be the state of things about him.</p>
<p>The soul is like a vase filled with water; while
the semblances of things fall like rays upon its surface. If the water is moved, the ray will seem to
be moved likewise, though it is in reality without
motion. When, therefore, any one is seized with
a giddiness in his head, it is not the arts and virtues that are bewildered, but the mind in which they
lie; when this recovers its composure, so will they
likewise.

<head>Concerning one who made himself improperly conspicuous in the theatre.</head>
<p>When the Governor of <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> had exerted himself with improper eagerness in favor of a
comedian, and was upon that account publicly railed
at, and, when he came to hear it, was highly displeased with those who railed at him, Why, what
harm, said Epictetus, have these people done? They
have shown favoritism; which is just what you did.</p>
<p>" Is this a proper manner, then, of expressing their
favor? "</p>
<p>Seeing you, their governor, and the friend and
vicegerent of Caesar, express it thus, was it not to be
expected that they would express it thus too? For
if this zealous favoritism is not right, do not show it
yourself; and if it is, why are you angry at them for
imitating you? For whom have the many to imitate,
but you, their superiors? From whom are they to
take example, when they come into the theatre, but
from you? "Do but look how Caesar's vicegerent
sees the play! Has he cried out?  I will cry out
too. Has he leaped up from his seat? I too will
leap up from mine. Do his slaves sit in different
parts of the house, making an uproar? I indeed
<pb id="p.2018"/>
have no slaves; but I will make as much uproar as
I can unaided."</p>
<p>You ought to consider, then, that when you appear
in the theatre, you appear as a rule and example to
others, how they ought to see the play. Why is it
that they have railed at you? Because every man
hates what hinders him. They would have one actor
crowned; you, another. They hindered you, and
you them. You proved the stronger. They have
done what they could; they have railed at the person
who hindered them. What would you have, then?
Would you do as you please, and not have them
even talk as they please? Where is the wonder of
all this? Does not the husbandman rail at <placeName key="tgn,2786910">Zeus</placeName>
when he is hindered by him? Does not the sailor?
Do men ever cease railing at Caesar? What, then; is
Zeus ignorant of this? Are not the things that are
said reported to Caesar? How then does he act? He
knows that, if he were to punish all railers, he would
have nobody left to command.</p>
<p>When you enter the theatre, then, ought you to
say, "Come, let Sophron be crowned "?  No. But
rather, " Come, let me at this time regulate my Will
in a manner conformable to Nature. No one is
dearer to me than myself. It is ridiculous, then,
that because another man gains the victory as a
player, I should be hurt. Whom do I wish to gain
the victory? Him who does gain it; and thus he
will always be victorious whom I wish to be so."
<pb id="p.2019"/>
"But I would have Sophron crowned."  Why, celebrate as many games as you will at your own house,
Nemean, Pythian, Isthmian, Olympic, and proclaim
him victor in all; but in public do not arrogate more
than your due, nor seek to monopolize what belongs
to all; or if otherwise, bear to be railed at, for if you
act like the mob, you reduce yourself co an equality
with them.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Concerning those who plead illness.</head>
<p>"I  am ill here," said one of the scholars. " I
will return home."</p>
<p>Were you never ill at home, then?   Consider
whether you are doing anything here conducive to
the regulation of your Will; for if you make no improvement, it was to no purpose that you came. Go
home, then, and take care of your domestic affairs.
For if your Reason cannot be brought into conformity
to nature, your land may. You may increase you:
money, support the old age of your father, mix in
the public assemblies, and rule as badly as you have
lived, and do other such things. But if you are conscious to yourself that you are casting off some of
your wrong principles, and taking up different ones
in their room; and that you have transferred your
scheme of life from things not controllable by will to
<pb id="p.2020"/>
those controllable; and that if you do sometimes cry
<emph>alas</emph>, it is not for what concerns your father or your
brother, but yourself, - why do you any longer plead
illness? Do not you know that both illness and
death must overtake us? At what employment?
The husbandman at his plough, the sailor on his
voyage. At what employment would you be taken?
For, indeed, at what employment ought you to be taken? If there is any better employment at which you
can be taken, follow that. For my own part, I would
be found engaged in nothing but in the regulation of
my own Will; how to render it undisturbed, unrestrained, uncompelled, free. I would be found studying this, that I may be able to say to God, " Have I
transgressed thy commands? Have I perverted the
powers, the senses, the instincts which thou hast
given me? Have I ever accused thee, or censured
thy dispensations? I have been ill, because it was
thy pleasure, like others; but I willingly. I have
been poor, it being thy will; but with joy. I have
not been in power, because it was not thy will; and
power I have never desired. Hast thou ever seen
me saddened because of this? Have I not always
approached thee with a cheerful countenance, prepared to execute thy commands and the indications
of thy will? Is it thy pleasure that I should depart from this assembly? I depart. I give thee all
thanks that thou hast thought me worthy to have a
snare in it with thee; to behold thy works, and to
<pb id="p.2021"/>
join with thee in comprehending thy administration." Let death overtake me while I am thinking,
while I am writing, while I am reading such things
as these.</p>
<p>"But I shall not have my mother to hold my head
when I am ill."</p>
<p>Get home then to your mother; for you are most
fit to have your head held when you are ill.</p>
<p>"But I used at home to lie on a fine couch."</p>
<p>Get to this couch of yours; for you are fit to lie
upon such a one, even in health; so do not miss
doing that for which you are qualified. But what
says <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>? <cit><quote>As one man rejoices in the improvement of his estate, another of his horse, so do I daily
rejoice in perceiving myself to grow better.</quote> <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.6">Xenophon, Mem. 1.6. - H.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>" In what, - in pretty speeches? "
Use courteous words, man.</p>
<p>"In trifling theorems? What do they signify?
Yet, indeed, I do not see that the philosophers are
employed in anything else."</p>
<p>Do you think it nothing, to accuse and censure
no one, God nor man; always to carry abroad
and bring home the same countenance?  These were
the things which <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> knew; and yet he never
professed to know, or to teach anything; but if any
one wanted pretty speeches, or little theorems, he
brought him to Protagoras, to Hippias; just as, if
any one had come for potherbs, he would have taken
<pb id="p.2022"/>
him to a gardener. Which of you, then, earnestly
sets his heart on this? If you had, you would bear
illness and hunger and death with cheerfulness.

<p>When he was asked how it came to pass, that
though the art of reasoning might be now
more studied, yet the improvements made were formerly greater? In what instance, answered he, is it
now more studied; and in what were the improvements greater? For in what now is most studied,
in that will be found likewise the improvements.
The present study is the solution of syllogisms, and
in this improvements are made. But formerly the
study was to harmonize the Reason with Nature;
and improvement was made in that. Therefore do
not confound things, nor, when you study one thing,
expect improvement in another; but see whether any
one of us who applies himself to think and act conformably to Nature ever fails of improvement. Depend upon it, you will not find one.</p>
<p>A good man is invincible; for he does not contend
where he is not superior. If you would have his
land, take it; take his servants, take his office, take
<pb id="p.2023"/>
his body. But you will never frustrate his desire,
nor make him incur his aversion. He engages in no
combat but what concerns objects within his own
control. How then can he fail to be invincible?</p>
<p>Being asked what common-sense was, he answered: As that may be called a common ear which
distinguishes only sounds, but that which distinguishes
notes, an artistic one; so there are some things which
men, not totally perverted, discern by their common
natural powers; and such a disposition is called
common-sense.</p>
<p>It is not easy to gain the attention of effeminate
young men,--for you cannot take up custard by a
hook, -but the ingenuous, even if you discourage
them, are the more eager for learning. Hence <placeName key="tgn,2633121">Rufus</placeName>, for the most part, did discourage them; and
made use of that as a criterion of the ingenuous and
disingenuous. For, he used to say, as a stone, even
if you throw it up, will by its own propensity be carried downward, so an ingenuous mind, the more it is
forced from its natural bent, will incline towards it
the more strongly.

<head>Concerning a certain governor who was an epicurean.</head>
<p>When   the Governor, who was an Epicurean,
came to him, "It is fit," said he, "that we
ignorant people should inquire of you philosophers
what is the most valuable thing in the world; as those
who come into a strange city do of the citizens and
such as are acquainted with it; that after this inquiry
we may go and take a view of it, as they do in cities.
Now, almost every one admits that there are three
things belonging to man, - soul, body, and externals.
It belongs to such as you to answer which is the best.
What shall we tell mankind? Is it the flesh?"</p>
<p>And was it for this that Maximus took a voyage in
winter as far as Cassiope to accompany his son? Was
it to gratify the flesh?</p>
<p><emph>"No</emph>, surely."
Is it not fit, then, to study what is best?
"Yes, beyond all other things."
What have we, then, better than flesh?
"The soul."</p>
<p>Are we to prefer the good of the better, or of the
worse?</p>
<p>" Of the better."
<pb id="p.2025"/></p>
<p>Does the good of the soul consist in things controllable by Will or uncontrollable?</p>
<p>" In things controllable."</p>
<p>Does the pleasure of the soul, then, depend on the
Will?</p>
<p>" It does."</p>
<p>And whence does this pleasure arise, - from itself?
This is unintelligible. For there must exist some
principal essence of good, in the attainment of which
we shall enjoy this pleasure of the soul.</p>
<p>"This too is granted."</p>
<p>In what, then, consists this pleasure of the soul? If
it be in mental objects, the essence of good is found.
For it is impossible that good should lie in one thing,
and rational enjoyment in another; or that, if the
cause is not good, the effect should be good. For, to
make the effect reasonable, the cause must be good.
But this you cannot reasonably allow; for it would
be to contradict both Epicurus and the rest of your
principles. It remains, then, that the pleasures of
the soul must consist in bodily objects; and that
there must be the cause and the essence of good.
Maximus, therefore, did foolishly, if he took a voyage
for the sake of anything but his body; that is, for the
sake of what is best. A man does foolishly too, if he
refrains from what is another's, when he is a judge
and able to take it. We should consider only this,
if you please, how it may be done secretly and safely,
and so that no one may know it. For Epicurus him-
<pb id="p.2026"/>
self does not pronounce stealing to be evil, only the
being found out in it; and prohibits it for no other
reason, but because it is impossible to insure ourselves
against discovery.  But I say to you that, if it be
done dexterously and cautiously, we shall not be
discovered. Besides, we have powerful friends of both
sexes at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and the Greeks are weak; and nobody will dare to go up to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> on such an affair.
Why do you refrain from your own proper good? It
is madness; it is folly. But if you were to tell me
that you do refrain, I would not believe you. For, as
it is impossible to assent to an apparent falsehood, or
to deny an apparent truth, so it is impossible to abstain from an apparent good. Now, riches are a
good, and, indeed, the chief instrument of pleasures.
Why do not you acquire them?  And why do not we
corrupt the wife of our neighbor, if it can be done
secretly? And if the husband should happen to be
impertinent, why not cut his throat too, if you have
a mind to be such a philosopher as you ought to be,-
a complete one, -to be consistent with your own
principles. Otherwise you will not differ from us who
are called Stoics. For we, too, say one thing and do
another; we talk well and act ill; but you will be
perverse in a contrary way, teaching bad principles,
and acting well.</p>
<p>For Heaven's sake represent to yourself a city of
Epicureans. " I do not marry."  " Nor I; for we
are not to marry nor have children, nor to engage
<pb id="p.2027"/>
in public affairs." What will be the consequence of
this? Whence are the citizens to come? Who will
educate them? Who will be the governor of the
youth? Who the master of their exercises? What
then will he teach them? Will it be what used to be
taught at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, or Lacedemon? Take a young
man; bring him up according to your principles.
These principles are wicked, subversive of a state,
pernicious to families, not becoming even to women.
Give them up, sir. You live in a capital city. You
are to govern and judge uprightly, and to refrain
from what belongs to others. No one's wife or child,
or silver or gold plate, is to have any charms for you,
except your own. Provide yourself with principles
consonant to these truths; and setting out thence,
you will with pleasure refrain from things so persuasive to mislead and conquer. But if to their own
persuasive force we can add such a philosophy as
hurries us upon them and confirms us in them, what
will be the consequence?</p>
<p>In a sculptured vase, which is the best, - the silver,
or the workmanship? In the hand the substance is
flesh; but its operations are the principal thing. Accordingly, its functions are threefold, - relating to its
existence, to the manner of its existence, and to its
principal operations. Thus, likewise, do not set a
value on the mere materials of man, the flesh; but on
the principal operations which belong to him.</p>
<p>"What are these?"
<pb id="p.2028"/></p>
<p>Engaging in public business, marrying, the production of children, the worship of God, the care of
parents, and, in general, the regulation of our desires
and aversions, our pursuits and avoidances, in accordance with our nature.</p>
<p>"What is our nature? "</p>
<p>To be free, noble-spirited, modest. For what other
animal blushes? What other has the idea of shame?
But pleasure must be subjected to these, as an attendant and handmaid, to call forth our activity, and to
keep us constant in natural operations.</p>
<p>"But I am rich and want nothing."</p>
<p>Then why do you pretend to philosophize? Your
gold and silver plate is enough for you. What need
have you of principles?</p>
<p>" Besides, I am Judge of the Greeks."</p>
<p>Do you know how to judge? Who has imparted
this knowledge to you?</p>
<p>" Caesar has given me a commission."</p>
<p>Let him give you a commission to judge of music;
what good will it do you? But how were you made
a Judge?  Whose hand have you kissed, -that of
Symphorus, or Numenius? Before whose door have
you slept? To whom have you sent presents? After
all, do you not perceive that the office of Judge puts
you in the same rank with Numenius?</p>
<p>" But I can throw whom I please into a prison."
So you may a stone.</p>
<p>" But I can beat whom I will too."
<pb id="p.2029"/></p>
<p>So you may an ass. This is not a government over
men.   Govern us like reasonable creatures.  Show
us what is best for us, and we will pursue it; show
us what is otherwise, and we will avoid it. Like <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, make us imitators of yourself. He was properly a governor of men, who controlled their desires
and aversions, their pursuits, their avoidances. "Do
this; do not that, or I will throw you into prison."
This is not a government for reasonable creatures.
But "Do as Zeus has commanded, or you will be
punished, and be a loser."</p>
<p>"What shall I lose?"</p>
<p>Simply your own right action, your fidelity, honor,
decency. You can find no losses greater than these.</p></div2>

<head>How we are to exercise ourselves in regard to the semblances of things.</head>
<p>In the same manner as we exercise ourselves against
sophistical questions, we should exercise ourselves
likewise in relation to such semblances as every day
occur; for these, too, offer questions to us. Such a
one's son is dead. What think you of it? Answer:
It is a thing inevitable, and therefore not an evil.
Such a one is disinherited by his father. What think
you of it?  It is inevitable; and so not an evil.
<pb id="p.2030"/>
Caesar has condemned him. This is inevitable, and so
not an evil. He has been afflicted by it. This is
controllable by Will; it is an evil. He has supported
it bravely. This is within the control of Will; it is a
good.</p>
<p>If we train ourselves in this manner we shall make
improvement; for we shall never assent to anything
but what the semblance itself includes. A son is
dead. What then?   A son is dead. Nothing more?
Nothing. A ship is lost. What then? A ship is
lost. He is carried to prison. What then?  He is
carried to prison. That he is <emph>unhappy</emph> is an addition
which every one must make for himself. " But Zeus
does not order these things rightly." Why so? Because he has made you to be patient? Because he
has made you to be brave? Because he has made
them to be no evils? Because it is permitted you,
while you suffer them, to be happy? Because he has
opened you the door whenever they do not suit you?
Go out, man, and do not complain !</p>
<p>If you would know how the Romans treat philosophers, hear. Italicus, esteemed one of the greatest
philosophers among them, being in a passion with his
own people when I was by, said, as if he had suffered

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<head>Concerning a certain orator, who was going to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> on a lawsuit.</head>
<p>A person came to him who was going to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>
on a lawsuit in which his dignity was concerned;
and after telling him the occasion of his journey,
asked him what he thought of the affair. If you ask
me, says Epictetus, what will happen to you at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>,
and whether you shall gain or lose your cause, I have
no suggestion as to that. But if you ask me how
you shall fare, I can answer, If you have right principles, well; if wrong ones, ill. For every action
turns upon its principle. What was the reason that
you so earnestly desired to be chosen Governor of the
Gnossians? Principle. What is the reason that you
are now going to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>? Principle. And in winter
too, and with danger and expense?  Why, because
it is necessary. What tells you so? Your principle.
If, then, principles are the source of all our actions,
wherever any one has bad principles the effect will
correspond to the cause. Well, then; are all our
principles sound? Are both yours and your antagonist's? How then do you differ? Or are yours better
than his? Why? You think so, and so thinks he
of his, and so do madmen. This is a bad criterion.
But show me that you have given some attention and
<pb id="p.2032"/>
care to your principles. As you now take a voyage
to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> for the government of the Gnossians, and
are not contented to stay at home with the honors
you before enjoyed, but desire something greater and
more illustrious, did you ever take such a voyage
in order to examine your own principles and to throw
away the bad ones, if you happened to have any?
Did you ever apply to any one upon this account?
What time did you ever appoint to yourself for
it? What age? Run over your years. If you are
ashamed of me, do it for yourself. Did you examine
your principles when you were a child? Did not you
act then as now? When you were a youth, and frequented the schools of the orators, and yourself made
declamations, did you ever imagine that you were
deficient in anything? And when you became a man
and entered upon public business, pleaded causes,
and acquired credit, whom did you then recognize as
your equal? How would you have borne that any
one should examine whether your principles were
bad? What, then, would you have me say to you?</p>
<p>" Assist me in this affair."</p>
<p>I have no suggestion to offer for that. Neither
are you come to me, if it be upon that account you
came, as to a philosopher; but as you would come to
an herb-seller or a shoemaker.</p>
<p>"For what purposes, then, can the philosophers
give suggestions?"</p>
<p>For preserving and conducting the Reason con-
<pb id="p.2033"/>
formably to Nature, whatever happens. Do you think
this a small thing?</p>
<p>"No, but the greatest."</p>
<p>Well, and does it require but a short time, and
may it be taken as you pass by? If you can, take it
then; and so you will say, " I have visited Epictetus." Ay; just as you would visit a stone or a
statue. For you have seen me, and nothing more.
But he visits a man, as a man, who learns his principles, and, in return, shows his own. Learn my
principles; show me yours. Then say you have
visited me. Let us confute each other. If I have
any bad principle, take it away. If you have any,
bring it forth. This is visiting a philosopher. No,
but "It lies in our way, and while we are about
hiring a ship, we may call on Epictetus. Let us see
what he says." And then when you are gone, you
say, " Epictetus is nothing. His language was inaccurate, was barbarous." For what else did you come
to criticise?  " Well; but if I employ myself in these
things, I shall be without an estate, like you, -without plate, without equipage, like you." Nothing, perhaps, is necessary to be said to this, but that I do
not want them. But if you possess many things, you
still want others; so that whether you will or not,
you are poorer than I.</p>
<p>"What then do I need?"</p>
<p>What you have not, -constancy, a mind conformable to Nature, and a freedom from perturbation.
<pb id="p.2034"/>
Patron or no patron, what care I?  But you do. I
am richer than you; I am not anxious what Caesar
will think of me; I flatter no one on that account.
This I have, instead of silver and gold plate. You
have your vessels of gold; but your discourse, your
principles, your opinions, your pursuits, your desires,
are of mere earthen ware. When I have all these
conformable to Nature, why should not I bestow
some study upon my reasoning too?  I am at leisure.
My mind is under no distraction.  In this freedom
from distraction, what shall I do? Have I anything
more becoming a man than this? You, when you
have nothing to do, are restless; you go to the theatre, or perhaps to bathe. Why should not the philosopher polish his reasoning? You have fine crystal
and myrrhine vases; <note anchored="yes"><cit><quote><l>And how they quaff in gold,</l>

<p>Myrrhine cups were probably a kind of agate described by
<placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName>, which, when burnt, had the smell of myrrh. See Teatro
Critico, Tom. 6, disc. 4.6. -C.</p></note> I have acute forms of arguing. To you, all you have appears little; to me all
I have seems great. Your appetite is insatiable;
mine is satisfied. When children thrust their hand
into a narrow jar of nuts and figs, if they fill it, they
cannot get it out again; then they begin crying.
Drop a few of them, and you will get out the rest.
And do you too drop your desire; do not demand
much, and you will attain.

<p>We should retain these verses so as to apply them
to our use; not merely to say them by rote, as we
do with verses in honor of Apollo.</p>
<p>Again, in a fever we should have such principles
ready as relate to a fever; and not, as soon as we
are taken ill, forget all. Provided I do but act like
a philosopher, let what will happen. Some way or
other I depart must from this frail body, whether a
<pb id="p.2036"/>
fever comes or not. What is it to be a philosopher?
Is it not to be prepared against events? Do you not
comprehend that you then say, in effect, "If I am but
prepared to bear all events with calmness, let what
will happen?" Otherwise you are like an athlete,
who, after receiving a blow, should quit the combat.
In that case, indeed, you might leave off without
a penalty. But what shall we get by leaving off
philosophy?</p>
<p>What, then; ought each of us to say upon every difficult occasion, "It was for this that I exercised;
it was for this that I trained myself"? God says to
you, Give me a proof if you have gone through the
preparatory combats according to rule; if you have
followed a proper diet and proper exercise; if you
have obeyed your master; and after this, do you
faint at the very time of action?</p>
<p>Now is your time for a fever. Bear it well. For
thirst; bear it well. For hunger; bear it well. Is it
not in your power? Who shall restrain you? A physician may restrain you from drinking, but he cannot
restrain you from bearing your thirst well. He may
restrain you from eating, but he cannot restrain you
from bearing hunger well. "t But I cannot follow my
studies." And for what end do you follow them,
slave? Is it not that you may be prosperous, that
you may be constant, that you may think and act
conformably to Nature? What restrains you, but
that, in a fever, you may keep your Reason in har-
<pb id="p.2037"/>
mony with Nature? Here is the test of the matter.
Here is the trial of the philosopher; for a fever is a
part of life, as is a walk, a voyage, or a journey. Do
you read when you are walking? No, nor in a fever.
But when you walk well, you attend to what belongs
to a walker; so, if you bear a fever well, you have
everything belonging to one in a fever. What is it to
bear a fever well? Not to blame either God or man,
not to be afflicted at what happens, to await death in
a right and becoming manner, and to do what is to
be done. When the physician enters, not to dread
what he may say; nor, if he should tell you that you
are doing well, to be too much rejoiced; for what good
has he told you? When you were in health, what
good did it do you?  Not to be dejected when he tells
you that you are very ill; for what is it to be very ill?
To be near the separation of soul and body. What
harm is there in this, then? If you are not near it
now, will you not be near it hereafter? What, will
the world be quite overturned when you die? Why,
then, do you flatter your physician? Why do you
say, "If you please, sir, I shall do well"?  Why
do you furnish an occasion to his pride? Why do
not you treat a physician, with regard to an insignificant body, - which is not yours, but by nature mortal,-as you do a shoemaker about your foot, or a
carpenter about a house? It is the season for these
things, to one in a fever. If he fulfils these, he has
what belongs to him. For it is not the business of a
<pb id="p.2038"/>
philosopher to take care of these mere externals, - of
his wine, his oil, or his body,--but of his Reason.
And how with regard to externals? Not to behave
inconsiderately about them.</p>
<p>What occasion is there, then, for fear; what
occasion for anger, for desire, about things that belong to others, or are of no value?  For two rules we
should always have ready, - <emph>that there is nothing good or evil save in the Will</emph>; and <emph>that we are not to lead events, but to follow them</emph>. " My brother ought not to
have treated me so." Very true; but he must see
to that. However he treats me, I am to act rightly
with regard to him; for the one is my own concern,
the other is not; the one cannot be restrained, the
other may.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Miscellaneous.</head>
<p>There are some punishments appointed, as by a
law, for such as disobey the Divine admnistration. Whoever shall esteem anything good, except
what depends on the Will, let him envy, let him
covet, let him flatter, let him be full of perturbation.
Whoever esteems anything else to be evil, let him
grieve, let him mourn, let him lament, let him be
wretched. And yet, though thus severely punished,
we cannot desist.
<pb id="p.2039"/>
Remember what the poet says of a guest, -
<cit><quote><l>It were not lawful to affront a guest,</l>
<l>Even did the worst draw nigh.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 14.54">Homer, Odyssey, xiv. 54. - H.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>This too you should be prepared to say with regard to a father, It is not lawful for me to affront
you, father, even if a worse than you had come; for
all are from paternal Zeus. And so of a brother;
for all are from kindred Zeus. And thus we shall
find Zeus to be the superintendent of all the other
relations.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Of training.</head>
<p>We are not to carry our training beyond Nature
and Reason; for thus we, who call ourselves
philosophers, shall not differ from jugglers. For it is
no doubt difficult to walk upon a rope, and not only
difficult, but dangerous. Ought we too, for that reason, to make it our study to walk upon a rope, or
balance a pole,<note anchored="yes">A phrase occurs here which has greatly puzzled the commentators, but which evidently refers to the gymnastic exercise known as the " perche-pole," where a pole is balanced by one performer and ascended by another. -H.</note> or grasp a statue? <note anchored="yes">Diogenes used, in winter, to grasp statues when they were covered with snow, as an exercise to inure himself to hardship. <bibl><author>Diogenes Laertius</author></bibl>. -C.</note> By no means.
<pb id="p.2040"/>
It is not everything difficult or dangerous that is a
proper training, but such things as are conducive
to what lies before us to do.</p>
<p>"And what is it that lies before us to do? "
To have our desires and aversions free from restraint.
"How is that?"</p>
<p>Not to be disappointed of our desire, nor incur our
aversion. To this ought our training to be directed.
For without vigorous and steady training, it is not
possible to preserve our desire undisappointed and
our aversion unincurred; and therefore, if we suffer
it to be externally employed on things uncontrollable
by Will, be assured that your desire will neither gain
its object, nor your aversion avoid it.</p>
<p>And because habit has a powerful influence, and
we are habituated to apply our desire and aversion
to externals only. we must oppose one habit to another: and where the semblances are most treacherous, there oppose the force of training. I am inclined
to pleasure. I will bend myself, even unduly, to the
other side, as a matter of training. I am averse to
pain. I will strive and wrestle with these semblances,
that I may cease to shrink from any such object. For
who is truly in training? He who endeavors totally
to control desire, and to apply aversion only to things
controllable by Will, and strives for it most in the
most difficult cases. Hence different persons are to
be trained in different ways. What signifies it, to this
<pb id="p.2041"/>
purpose, to balance a pole, or to go about with tent
and implements [of exhibition]?  If you are hasty,
man, let it be your training to bear ill language
patiently; and when you are affronted, not to be
angry. Thus, at length, you may arrive at such a
proficiency as, when any one strikes you, to say to
yourself, " Let me suppose this to be like grasping a
statue." Next train yourself to make but a moderate use of wine, - not to drink a great deal, to which
some are so foolish as to train themselves, - but to
abstain from  this first; and then to abstain from
women and from gluttony. Afterwards you will venture into the lists at some proper season, by way of
trial, if at all, to see whether these semblances get
the better of you as much as they used to do. But
at first flee from what is stronger than you. The contest between a fascinating woman and a young man
just initiated into philosophy is unequal. The brass
pot and the earthen pitcher, as the fable says, are an
unfair match.</p>
<p>Next to the desires and aversions is the second
class, of the pursuits and avoidances; that they may
be obedient to reason; that nothing may be done improperly, in point of time and place, or in any other
respect.</p>
<p>The third class relates to the faculty of assent and
to what is plausible and persuasive. As <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>
said that we are not to lead a life which is not
tested, so neither are we to admit an untested sem-
<pb id="p.2042"/>
blance; but to say, "Stop, let me see what you are
and whence you come," just as the police say, "Show
me your pass." " Have you that indorsement from
Nature which is necessary to the acceptance of every
semblance?"</p>
<p>In short, whatever things are applied to the body
by those who train it, so may these be used in our
training if they any way affect desire or aversion.
But if this be done for mere ostentation, it belongs
to one who looks and seeks for something external,
and strives for spectators to exclaim, "What a great
man!"   Hence Apollonius said well, "If you have
a mind to train yourself for your own benefit, when
you are choking with heat, take a little cold water in
your mouth, and spit it out again, and hold your
tongue."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<head>What solitude is; and what a solitary person.</head>
<p>It is solitude to be in the condition of a helpless
person. For he who is alone is not therefore solitary, any more than one in a crowd is the contrary.
When, therefore, we lose a son, or a brother, or a
friend, on whom we have been used to repose, we
often say we are left solitary, even in the midst of
<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, where such a crowd is continually meeting
us; where we live among so many, and where we
<pb id="p.2043"/>
have, perhaps, a numerous train of servants. For he
is understood to be solitary who is helpless, and exposed to such as would injure him. Hence, in a
journey especially, we call ourselves solitary when we
fall among thieves; for it is not the sight of a man
that removes our solitude, but of an honest man, a
man of honor, and a helpful companion. If merely
being alone is sufficient for solitude, Zeus may be
said to be solitary at the great conflagration,<note anchored="yes">The Stoics held to successive conflagrations at destined periods, in which all beings were reabsorbed into the Deity. -C.</note> and
bewail himself that he hath neither Here, nor Athene,
nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son, nor descendant, nor
relation. This, some indeed say, he doth when he is
alone at the conflagration. Such as these, moved by
some natural principle, some natural desire of society and mutual love, and by the pleasure of conversation, do not rightly consider the state of a person
who is alone. But none the less should we be prepared for this also, to suffice unto ourselves, and to
bear our own company. For as Zeus converses with
himself, acquiesces in himself, and contemplates his
own administration, and is employed in thoughts
worthy of himself; so should we too be able to talk
with ourselves, and not to need the conversation of
others, nor suffer ennui; to attend to the divine administration; to consider our relation to other beings; how we have formerly been affected by events,
<pb id="p.2044"/>
how we are affected now; what are the things that
still press upon us; how these too may be cured, how
removed; if anything wants completing, to complete
it according to reason. You perceive that Caesar has
procured us a profound peace; there are neither wars
nor battles, nor great robberies nor piracies; but we
may travel at all hours, and sail from east to west.
But can Caesar procure us peace from a fever too;
from a shipwreck; from a fire; from an earthquake;
from a thunder-storm; nay, even from love? He
cannot. From grief; from envy? No, not from
any one of these.   But the doctrine of philosophers promises to procure us peace from these too.
And what doth it say?  " If you will attend to me,
O mortals ! wherever you are, and whatever you are
doing, you shall neither grieve, nor be angry, nor be
compelled, nor restrained; but you shall live serene,
and free from all." Shall not he who enjoys this
peace proclaimed, not by Caesar (for how should he
have it to proclaim?), but by God, through Reason, be contented when he is alone, reflecting and
considering, "To me there can now no ill happen;
there is no <sic>thier</sic>, no earthquake. All is full of peace,
all full of tranquillity; every road, every city, every
assembly, neighbor, companion, is powerless to hurt
me "? Another, whose care it is, provides you with
food, with clothes, with senses, with ideas. Whenever he doth not provide what is necessary, he
sounds a retreat; he opens the door and says to
<pb id="p.2045"/>
you, "Come."   Whither?   To nothing dreadful;
but to that whence you were made, -to what is
friendly and congenial, to the elements. What in
you was fire goes away to fire; what was earth,
to earth; what air, to air; what water, to water.
There is no Hades, nor Acheron, nor Cocytus, nor
Pyriphlegethon; but all is full of gods and divine
beings. He who can have such thoughts, and can
look upon the sun, moon, and stars, and enjoy the
earth and sea, is no more solitary than he is helpless.
"Well; but suppose any one should come and murder me when I am alone." Foolish man! - not you,
but that insignificant body of yours.</p>
<p>What solitude is there then left; what destitution? Why do we make ourselves worse than children? What do they do when they are left alone?
They take up shells and dust; they build houses,
then pull them down; then build something else;
and thus never want amusement. Suppose you were
all to sail away; am I to sit and cry because I am
left alone and solitary? Am I so unprovided with
shells and dust? But children do this from folly;
and shall we be wretched through wisdom?</p>
<p>Every great gift is dangerous to a beginner. Study
first how to live like a person in sickness; that in time
you may know how to live like one in health. Abstain from food. Drink water. Totally repress your
desire for some time, that you may at length use it
according to reason; and if so, when you are stronger
<pb id="p.2046"/>
in virtue, you will use it well. No; but we would
live immediately as men already wise, and be of service to mankind. Of what service? What are you
doing? Why, have you been of so much service to
yourself that you would exhort them?  <emph>You</emph> exhort!
Would you be of service to them, show them by your
own example what kind of men philosophy makes,
and do not trifle. When you eat, be of service to
those who eat with you; when you drink, to those
who drink with you. Be of service to them by giving way to all, yielding to them, bearing with them;

<head>Miscellaneous.</head>
<p>As bad performers cannot sing alone, but in a
chorus, so some persons cannot walk alone.
If you are anything, walk alone; talk by yourself;
and do not skulk in the chorus. Think a little at
last; look about you; sift yourself, that you may
know what you are.</p>
<p>If a person drinks water, or does anything else for
the sake of training, upon every occasion he tells all
he meets, " I drink water." Why, do you drink water merely for the sake of drinking it? If it does
you any good to drink it. do so; if not, you act
<pb id="p.2047"/>
ridiculously. But if it is for your advantage that you
drink it, say nothing about it before those who would
criticise. Yet can it be possible that these are the
very people you wish to please?</p>
<p>Of actions, some are performed on their own account; others from circumstances, others from complaisance, others upon system.</p>
<p>Two things must be rooted out of men, conceit and
diffidence. Conceit lies in thinking that you want
nothing; and diffidence in supposing it impossible
that under such adverse circumstances you should
ever succeed. Now, conceit is removed by confutation; and of this Socrates set the example. And
consider and ascertain that the undertaking is not
impracticable. The inquiry itself will do you no
harm; and it is almost being a philosopher to inquire how it is possible to employ our desire and
aversion without hindrance.</p>
<p>" I am better than you, for my father has been
consul."  "I have been a tribune," says another,
"and you not."  If we were horses, would you say,
"My father was swifter than yours; I have abundance of oats and hay and fine trappings "? What
now, if, while you were saying this, I should answer:
" Be it so. Let us run a race then "? Is there nothing in man analogous to a race in horses, by which
it may be decided which is better or worse? Is
there not honor, fidelity, justice? Show yourself the
better in these, that you may be the better as a man.

I will tell you again that you value yourself on what
is the property of an ass.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<head>That everything is to be undertaken with circumspection.<note anchored="yes">This fifteenth chapter makes the twenty-ninth of the Enchiridion, but with some varieties of reading. -C.</note></head>
<p>In every affair consider what precedes and follows,
and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin
with spirit indeed, careless of the consequences, and
when these are developed, you will shamefully desist.
" I would conquer at the Olympic Games." But consider what precedes and follows, and then, if it be
for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must
conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or
not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must
drink no cold water, and sometimes no wine, -in a
word, you must give yourself up to your trainer as
to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be
thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your
ankle, swallow abundance of dust, receive stripes
[for negligence], and, after all, lose the victory.
When you have reckoned up all this, if your incli-
<pb id="p.2049"/>
nation still holds, set about the combat. Otherwise,
take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play wrestlers, sometimes gladiators; sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy,
when they happen to have seen and admired these
shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler,
at another a gladiator; now a philosopher, now an
orator; but nothing in earnest. Like an ape you
mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure
to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon
anything considerately, nor after having surveyed
and tested the whole matter; but carelessly, and with
a half-way zeal. Thus some, when they have seen a
philosopher, and heard a man speaking like <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName> was a philosopher of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, whose character
is described, with the highest encomiums, by Pliny. See L. I.
Ep.x.-C.</note>--though indeed who can speak like him?-
have a mind to be philosophers too. Consider first,
man, what the matter is, and what your own nature
is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider
your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you
think that you can act as you do and be a philosopher; that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now?  You must watch, you must
labor, you must get the better of certain appetites;
must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your
<pb id="p.2050"/>
servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off
worse than others in everything, - in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please; if, by
parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come
hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher,
then a publican, then an orator, and then one of
Caesar's officers. These things are not consistent.
You must be one man either good or bad. You
must cultivate either your own Reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or
without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one
10f the mob.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<head>That caution should be used, as to personal familiarity.</head>
<p>He who frequently mingles with others, either in
conversation or at entertainments, or in any
familiar way of living, must necessarily either become
like his companions, or bring them over to his own
way. For if a dead coal be applied to a live one,
either the first will quench the last, or the last kindle
the first. Since, then, the danger is so great, caution must be used in entering into these familiarities
with the crowd. remembering that it is impossible
<pb id="p.2051"/>
to touch a chimney-sweeper without being partaker
of his soot. For what will you do if you have to
discuss gladiators, horses, wrestlers, and, what is
worse, men? "Such a one is good, another bad;
this was well, that ill, done." Besides, what if any
one should sneer, or ridicule, or be ill-natured? Are
any of you prepared, like a harper, who, when he
takes his harp and tries the strings, finds out which
notes are discordant, and knows how to put the instrument in tune? Have any of you such a faculty
as Socrates had, who in every conversation could
bring his companions to his own purpose?  Whence
should you have it? You must therefore be carried
along by the crowd. And why are they more powerful than you? Because they utter their corrupt discourses from sincere opinion, and you your good ones
only from your lips. Hence they are without strength
or life; and it is disgusting to hear your exhortations
and your poor miserable virtue proclaimed up hill and
down. Thus it is that the crowd gets the better of
you; for sincere opinion is always strong, always invincible. Therefore before wise sentiments are fixed
in you, and you have acquired some power of self-defence, I advise you to be cautious in popular intercourse; otherwise, if you have any impressions made
on you in the schools, they will melt away daily like
wax before the sun. Get away then, far from the
sun, while you have these waxen opinions.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the philosophers advise us
<pb id="p.2052"/>
to leave our country; because habitual practices draw
the mind aside and prevent the formation of new
habits. We cannot bear that those who meet us
should say, "Hey-day! such a one is turned philosopher, who was formerly thus and so." Thus physicians send patients with lingering distempers to
another place and another air; and they do right.
Do you too import other manners instead of those
you carry out.  Fix your opinions, and exercise
yourself in them. No; but you go hence to the
theatre, to the gladiators, to the walks, to the circus;
then hither again, then back again,- just the same
persons all the while ! No good habit, no criticism,
no animadversion upon ourselves. No observation
what use we make of the appearances presented to
our minds, - whether it be conformable, or contrary
to Nature; whether we interpret them rightly or
wrongly. Can I say to the inevitable that it is nothing to me? If this be not yet your case, flee from
your former habits; flee from the crowd if you would
ever begin to be anything.

<head>Of providence.</head>
<p>Whenever you lay anything to the charge of
Providence, do but reflect, and you will find
that it has happened agreeably to Reason.</p>
<p>"Well; but a dishonest man has the advantage."
In what?</p>
<p>"In money."</p>
<p>Here he ought to surpass you; because he flatters,
he is shameless, he keeps awake. Where is the wonder? But look whether he has the advantage of you
in fidelity or in honor. You will find he has not,
but that wherever it is best for you to have the advantage of him, there you have it. I once said to one
who was full of indignation at the good fortune of
Philostorgus, "Why, would you be willing to sleep
with <placeName key="perseus,Sura">Sura</placeName>?" <note anchored="yes">This person is not known. One of his name is mentioned in the <emph>Acts of Ignatius</emph>, as being consul at the time when he suffered martyrdom.-C.</note> Heaven forbid, said he, that day
should ever come ! Why then are you angry that he
is paid for what he sells; or how can you call him
happy in possessions acquired by means which you
detest?  Or what harm does Providence do in giving
the best things to the best men? Is it not better to
have a sense of honor than to be rich? " Granted."
Why then are you angry, man, if you have what is
<pb id="p.2054"/>
best? Always remember, then, and have it in mind
that a better man has the advantage of a worse in
that direction in which he is better; and you will
never have any indignation.</p>
<p>" But my wife treats me ill."</p>
<p>Well; if you are asked what is the matter, answer,</p>
<p>"My wife treats me ill."</p>
<p>"Nothing more?"</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>"My father gives me nothing."  But to call this an
evil, some external and false addition must be made.
We are not therefore to get rid of poverty, but of our
impressions concerning it; and we shall do well.</p>
<p>When Galba was killed, somebody said to <placeName key="tgn,2633121">Rufus</placeName>,

<head>That we ought not to be alarmed by any news that is brought us.</head>
<p>When any alarming news is brought you, always
have it ready in mind that no news can be
brought you concerning what is within the power of
your own Will. Can any one bring you news that
your opinions or desires are ill conducted? By no
<pb id="p.2055"/>
means; only that such a person is dead. What is
that to <emph>you</emph> then?   That somebody speaks ill of you.
And what is that to <emph>you</emph> then?  That your father is
perhaps forming some contrivance or other. Against
what?  Against your Will?  How can he?  No; but
against your body, against your estate?  You are very
safe; this is not against <emph>you</emph>.  But the Judge has
pronounced you guilty of impiety. And did not the
Judges pronounce the same of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>? Is his pronouncing a sentence any business of yours? No.
Then why do you any longer trouble yourself about
it? There is a duty incumbent on your father, which
unless he performs, he loses the character of a father,
of natural affection, of tenderness. Do not desire him
to lose anything else by this; for every man suffers
precisely where he errs. Your duty, on the other
hand, is to meet the case with firmness, modesty, and
mildness; otherwise you forfeit piety, modesty, and
nobleness. Well, and is your Judge free from danger? No; he runs an equal hazard. Why, then,
are you still afraid of his decision? What have you
to do with the ills of another? Meeting the case
wrongly would be your own ill. Let it be your only
care to avoid that; but whether sentence is passed
on you or not, as it is the business of another, so the
ill belongs to him. "Such a one threatens you."
<emph>Me</emph>?   No. "He censures you."   Let him look to it,
how he does his own duty. " He will give an unjust
sentence against you." Poor wretch !

<head>What is the comparative condition of the philosopher, and of the crowd.</head>
<p>The first difference between one of the crowd and
a philosopher is this: the one says, "I am undone on the account of my child, my brother, my
father;" but the other, if ever he be obliged to say,
"I am undone ! " reflects, and adds, "on account of
myself."  For the Will cannot be restrained or hurt
by anything to which the Will does not extend, but
only by itself.  If, therefore, we always would incline
this way, and whenever we are unsuccessful, would
lay the fault on ourselves, and remember that there is
no cause of perturbation and inconstancy but wrong
principles, I pledge myself to you that we should
make some proficiency. But we set out in a very different way from the very beginning. In infancy, for
example, if we happen to stumble, our nurse does
not chide us, but beats the stone. Why, what harm
has the stone done? Was it to move out of its place
for the folly of your child? Again, if we do not find
something to eat when we come out of the bath, our
tutor does not try to moderate our appetite, but beats
the cook. Why, did we appoint you tutor of the
cook, man? No; but of our child. It is he whom
you are to correct and improve. By these means,
<pb id="p.2057"/>
even when we are grown up, we appear children.
For an unmusical person is a child in music; an illiterate person, a child in learning; and an untaught
one, a child in life.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<head>That some advantage may be gained from every outward circumstance.</head>
<p>In considering sensible phenomena, almost all persons admit good and evil to lie in ourselves and
not in externals. No one says it is good to be day,
evil to be night, and the greatest evil that three
should be four; but what? That knowledge is good
and error evil. Even in connection with falsehood
itself there may be one good thing, -the knowledge
that it is falsehood.  Thus, then, should it be in life
also. " Health is a good; sickness an evil." No, sir.
But what? A right use of health is a good; a wrong
one, an evil. So that, in truth, it is possible to be a
gainer even by sickness. And is it not possible by
death too; by mutilation? Do you think Menaeceus<note anchored="yes">The son of Creon, who killed himself, after he had been informed by an oracle that his death would procure a victory to the Thebans.- C.</note>
an inconsiderable gainer by death?  "May whoever
talks thus be such a gainer as he was !" Why, pray,
sir, did not he preserve his patriotism, his magna-
<pb id="p.2058"/>
nimity, his fidelity, his gallant spirit? And if he had
lived on, would he not have lost all these?  Would not
cowardice, baseness, and hatred of his country, and
a wretched love of life, have been his portion? Well,
now; do not you think him a considerable gainer by
dying? No; but I warrant you the father of Admetus
was a great gainer by living on in so mean-spirited
and wretched a way as he did! For did not he die
at last? For Heaven's sake, cease to be thus deluded by externals. Cease to make yourselves slaves,
first of things, and then, upon their account, of the
men who have the power either to bestow or to take
them away. Is there any advantage, then, to be gained
from these men? From all; even from a reviler.
What advantage does a wrestler gain from him with
whom he exercises himself before the combat?  The
greatest. And just in the same manner I exercise
myself with this man. He exercises me in patience,
in gentleness, in meekness. I am to suppose, then,
that I gain an advantage from him who exercises my
neck, and puts my back and shoulders in order; so
that the trainer may well bid me grapple him with
both hands, and the heavier he is the better for me;
and yet it is no advantage to me when I am exercised in gentleness of temper ! This is not to know
how to gain an advantage from men. Is my neighbor a bad one?  He is so to himself, but a good one
to me; he exercises my good temper, my moderation. Is my father bad? To himself; but not to me.
<pb id="p.2059"/>
"This is the rod of Hermes. Touch with it whatever
you please, and it will become gold." No; but bring
whatever you please, and I will turn it into <emph>good</emph>.
Bring sickness, death, want, reproach, trial for life.
All these, by the rod of Hermes, shall turn to advantage. "What will you make of death? "  Why, what
but an ornament to you; what but a means of your
showing, by action, what that man is who knows and
follows the will of Nature? "What will you make of
sickness?" I will show its nature. I will make a
good figure in it; I will be composed and happy; I
will not beseech my physician, nor yet will I pray to
die.  What need you ask further?  Whatever you
give me, I will make it happy, fortunate, respectable,
and eligible.</p>
<p>No, but, " take care not to be sick - it is an evil."
Just as if one should say, "Take care that the semblance of three being four does not present itself to
you. It is an evil." How an evil, man? If I think
as I ought about it, what hurt will it any longer do
me?  Will it not rather be even an advantage to me?
If then I think as I ought of poverty, of sickness, of
political disorder, is not that enough for me? Why
then must I any longer seek good or evil in externals?</p>
<p>But how is it?  These truths are admitted <emph>here</emph>;
but nobody carries them home, for immediately every
one is in a state of war with his servant, his neighbors,
with those who sneer and ridicule him. Many thanks
to Lespius for proving every day that I know nothing.

<head>Concerning those who readily set up for sophists.</head>
<p>They who have merely received bare maxims are
presently inclined to throw them up, as a sick
stomach does its food. Digest it, and then you will
not throw it up; otherwise it will be crude and impure, and unfit for nourishment. But show us, from
what you have digested, some change in your ruling
faculty; as wrestlers do in their shoulders, from their
exercise and their diet; as artificers, in their skill,
from what they have learnt. A carpenter does not
come and say, "Hear me discourse on the art of
building;" but he hires a building, and fits it up, and
shows himself master of his trade. Let it be your
business likewise to do something like this; be manly
in your ways of eating, drinking, dressing; marry, have
children, perform the duty of a citizen; bear reproach; bear with an unreasonable brother; bear with
a father; bear with a son, a neighbor, a companion,
as becomes a man. Show us these things, that we
may see that you have really learned something from
the philosophers. No; but" come and hear me repeat
commentaries." Get you gone, and seek somebody
else upon whom to bestow them. "Nay, but I will
<pb id="p.2061"/>
explain the doctrines of Chrysippus to you as no other
person can; I will elucidate his style in the clearest
manner." And is it for this, then, that young men
leave their country and their own parents, that they
may come and hear you explain words? Ought they
not to return patient, active, free from passion, free
from perturbation; furnished with such a provision
for life, that, setting out with it, they will be able
to bear all events well, and derive ornament from
them? But how should you impart what you have
not? For have you yourself done anything else, from
the beginning, but spend your time in solving syllogisms and convertible propositions and interrogatory
arguments?  " But such a one has a school, and why
should not I have one?" Foolish man, these things
are not brought about carelessly and at haphazard;
but there must be a fit age, and a method of life, and
a guiding God. Is it not so?  No one quits the port,
or sets sail, till he hath sacrificed to the gods, and implored their assistance; nor do men sow without first
invoking <placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName>. And shall any one who has undertaken so great a work attempt it safely without the
gods?   And shall they who apply to such a one,
apply to him with success? What are you doing else,
man, but divulging the mysteries? As if you said,
" There is a temple at <placeName key="tgn,7011134">Eleusis</placeName>, and here is one too;
there is a priest, and I will make a priest here; there
is a herald, and I will appoint a herald too; there is a
torch-bearer, and I will have a torch-bearer; there
<pb id="p.2062"/>
are torches, and so shall there be here. The words
said, the things done, are the same. Where is the
difference betwixt one and the other?" Most impious man ! is there no difference? Are these things
of use, out of place and out of time? A man should
come with sacrifices and prayers, previously purified,
and his mind affected by the knowledge that he is
approaching sacred and ancient rites. Thus the mysteries become useful; thus we come to have an idea
that all these things were appointed by the ancients
for the instruction and correction of life. But you divulge and publish them without regard to time and
place, without sacrifices, without purity; you have not
the garment that is necessary for a priest, nor the fitting hair nor girdle, nor the voice, nor the age, nor
have you purified yourself like him. But when you
have got the words by heart, you say, "The mere
words are sacred of themselves." These things are to
be approached in another manner. It is a great, it
is a mystical affair; not given by chance, or to every
one indifferently. Nay, mere wisdom, perhaps, is not
a sufficient qualification for the care of youth. There
ought to be likewise a certain readiness and aptitude for this, and indeed a particular physical temperament, and, above all, a counsel from God to
undertake this office, as he counselled <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> to
undertake the office of confutation; Diogenes, that
of authoritative reproof; <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, that of dogmatical
instruction. But you set up for a physician, provided
<pb id="p.2063"/>
with nothing but medicines, and without knowing, or
having studied, where or how they are to be applied.
"Why, such a one had medicines for the eyes, and
I have the same." Have you also, then, a faculty of
making use of them? Do you at all know when and
how and to whom they will be of service? Why then
do you act at hazard?   Why are you careless in
things of the greatest importance?  Why do you
attempt a matter unsuitable to you?  Leave it to
those who can perform it and do it honor. Do not
you too bring a scandal upon philosophy by your
means; nor be one of those who cause the thing
itself to be calumniated. But if mere theorems delight you, sit quietly and turn them over by yourself;
but never call yourself a philosopher, nor suffer another to call you so; but say, He is mistaken; for
my desires are not different from what they were;
nor my pursuits directed to other objects; nor my
assents otherwise given; nor have I at all made any
change from my former condition in the use of things
as they appear. Think and speak thus of yourself, if
you would think as you ought; if not, act at random,
and do as you do; for it is appropriate to you.

<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Of the Cynic philosophy.</head>
<p>When one of his scholars, who seemed inclined
to the Cynic philosophy, asked him what a
Cynic must be, and what was the general plan of
that sect, Let us examine it, he said, at our leisure. But thus much I can tell you now, that he
who attempts so great an affair without divine guidance is an object of divine wrath, and would only
bring public dishonor upon himself. For in a well-regulated house no one comes and says to himself,
"I ought to be the manager here."  If he does, and
the master returns and sees him insolently giving
orders, he drags him out and has him punished.
Such is the case likewise in this great city. For
here, too, is a master of the family who orders everything. <emph>" You</emph> are the sun; you can, by making a circuit, form the year and the seasons, and increase and
nourish the fruits; you can raise and calm the winds,
and give an equable warmth to the bodies of men.
Go; make your circuit, and thus move everything
from the greatest to the least.  <emph>You</emph> are a calf; when
the lion appears, act accordingly, or you will suffer for
it. <emph>You</emph> are a bull; come and fight; for that is incumbent on you and becomes you, and you can do
<pb id="p.2065"/>
it. <emph>You</emph> can lead an army to <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>; be you Agamemnon. <emph>You</emph> can engage in single combat with
<placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>; be you Achilles." But if Thersites had
come and claimed the command, either he would not
have obtained it, or, if he had, he would have disgraced himself before so many more witnesses.</p>
<p>Do you, too, carefully deliberate upon this undertaking; it is not what you think it. "I wear an
old cloak now, and I shall have one then. I sleep
upon the hard ground now, and I shall sleep so
then. I will moreover take a wallet and a staff, and
go about, and beg of those I meet, and begin by rebuking them; and if I see any one using effeminate
practices, or arranging his curls, or walking in purple,
I will rebuke him." If you imagine this to be the
whole thing, avaunt; come not near it; it belongs
not to you. But if you imagine it to be what it
really is, and do not think yourself unworthy of it,
consider how great a thing you undertake.</p>
<p>First, with regard to yourself; you must no longer,
in any instance, appear as now. You must accuse
neither God nor man. You must altogether control
desire, and must transfer aversion to such things
only as are controllable by Will. You must have
neither anger, nor resentment, nor envy, nor pity.
Neither boy, nor girl, nor fame, nor dainties must
have charms for you. For you must know that other
men indeed fence themselves with walls and houses
and darkness, when they indulge in anything of this
<pb id="p.2066"/>
kind, and have many concealments; a man shuts the
door, places somebody before the apartment: "Say
that he is out; say that he is engaged."  But the
Cynic, instead of all this, must fence himself with
virtuous shame; otherwise he will be improperly exposed in the open air. This is his house, this his
door, this his porter, this his darkness. He must not
wish to conceal anything relating to himself; for if
he does, he is gone; he has lost the Cynic character,
the openness, the freedom; he has begun to fear
something external; he has begun to need concealment, nor can he get it when he will. For where
shall he conceal himself, or how? For if this tutor,
this pedagogue of the public, should happen to slip,
what must he suffer? Can he, then, who dreads these
things, be thoroughly bold within, and prescribe to
other men? Impracticable, impossible.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, you must purify your own
ruling faculty, to match this method of life. Now,
the material for me to work upon is my own mind, as
wood is for a carpenter, or leather for a shoemaker;
and my business is a right use of things as they appear. But body is nothing to me; its parts nothing
to me. Let death come when it will, either of the
whole body or of part.   "Go into exile."  And
whither?  Can any one turn me out of the universe?
He cannot. But wherever I go there is the sun, the
moon, the stars, dreams, auguries, communication
with God.   And even this preparation is by no
<pb id="p.2067"/>
means sufficient for a true Cynic. But it must further be known that he is a messenger sent from Zeus
to men, concerning good and evil; to show them that
they are mistaken, and seek the essence of good and
evil where it is not, but do not observe it where it is;
that he is a spy, like Diogenes, when he was brought
to Philip after the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>. For, in effect, a Cynic is a spy to discover what things are
friendly, what hostile, to man; and he must, after
making an accurate observation, come and tell them
the truth; not be struck with terror, so as to point
out to them enemies where there are none; nor, in
any other instance, be disconcerted or confounded
by appearances.</p>
<p>He must, then, if it should so happen, be able to
lift up his voice, to come upon the stage, and say,
like <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>: </p><p>O mortals, whither are you hurrying?
What are you about? Why do you tumble up and
down, O miserable wretches! like blind men? You
are going the wrong way, and have forsaken the right.
You seek prosperity and happiness in a wrong place,
where they are not; nor do you give credit to another,
who shows you where they are. Why do you seek
this possession without? It lies not in the body; if
you do not believe me, look at Myro, look at Ofellius.
It is not in wealth; if you do not believe me, look
upon Croesus; look upon the rich of the present age,
how full of lamentation their life is. It is not in
power; for otherwise, they who have been twice and
<pb id="p.2068"/>
thrice consuls must be happy; but they are not. To
whom shall we give heed in these things, - to you
who look only upon the externals of their condition,
and are dazzled by appearances, or to themselves?
What do they say? Hear them when they groan,
when they sigh, when they pronounce themselves the
more wretched and in more danger from these very
consulships, this glory and splendor. It is not in
empire; otherwise <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> and Sardanapalus had been
happy. But not even Agamemnon was happy, though
a better man than Sardanapalus or Nero. But when
others sleep soundly, what is he doing?

<p>And what does he himself say?
"I wander bewildered; my heart leaps forth from my
bosom."</p>
<p>Why, which of your affairs goes ill, poor wretch,
your possessions? No. Your body? No. But you
have gold and brass in abundance. What then goes
ill? That part of you is neglected and corrupted,
whatever it be called, by which we desire, and shrink;
by which we pursue, and avoid. How neglected?  It
is ignorant of that for which it was naturally formed,
of the essence of good, and of the essence of evil. It
is ignorant what is its own, and what another's. And
when anything belonging to others goes ill, it says, " I
<pb id="p.2069"/>
am undone; the Greeks are in danger ! "  (Poor ruling faculty ! which alone is neglected, and has no care
taken of it.) "They will die by the sword of the
Trojans ! " And if the Trojans should not kill them,
will they not die? "Yes, but not all at once." Why,
where is the difference? For if it be an evil to die,
then whether it be all at once or singly, it is equally
an evil. Will anything more happen than the separation of soul and body? " Nothing." And when the
Greeks perish, is the door shut against you?  Is it not
in your power to die?  "It is."  Why then do you
lament, while you are a king and hold the sceptre of
Zeus? A king is no more to be made unfortunate
than a god. What are you, then? You are a mere
shepherd, truly so called; for you weep, just as shepherds do when the wolf seizes any of their sheep;
and they who are governed by you are mere sheep.
But why do you come hither? Was your desire
in any danger; your aversion; your pursuits; your
avoidances? "No," he says, "but my brother's wife
has been stolen." Is it not great good luck, then, to
be rid of an adulterous wife?  " But must we be held
in contempt by the Trojans? " What are they, - wise
men, or fools? If wise, why do you go to war with
them? If fools, why do you heed them?</p>
<p>Where, then, does our good lie, since it does not
lie in these things? Tell us, sir, you who are our
messenger and spy. Where you do not think, nor
are willing to seek it. For if you were willing, you
<pb id="p.2070"/>
would find it in yourselves; nor would you wander
abroad, nor seek what belongs to others, as your own.
Turn your thoughts upon yourselves. Consider the
impressions which you have. What do you imagine
good to be? What is prosperous, happy, unhindered.
Well, and do you not naturally imagine it great?
Do you not imagine it valuable?  Do you not imagine it incapable of being hurt?  Where, then, must
you seek prosperity and exemption from hindrance,
- in that which is enslaved, or free? " In the free."
Is your body, then, enslaved or free? We do not
know. Do you not know that it is the slave of fever,
gout, defluxion, dysentery; of a tyrant; of fire, steel;
of everything stronger than itself? " Yes, it is a slave."
How, then, can anything belonging to the body be
unhindered? And how can that be great or valuable,
which is by nature lifeless, earth, clay? What, then;
have you nothing free?  "Possibly nothing."  Why,
who can compel you to assent to what appears false?
No one. Or who, not to assent to what appears true?
No one. Here, then, you see that there is something
in you naturally free. But which of you can desire or
shun, or use his active powers of pursuit or avoidance,
or prepare or plan anything, unless he has been impressed by an appearance of its being for his advantage or his duty? No one. You have, then, in these
too something unrestrained and free. Cultivate this,
unfortunates; take care of this; seek for good here.
" But how is it possible that a man destitute, naked,
<pb id="p.2071"/>
without house or home, squalid, unattended, an outcast, can lead a prosperous life?"  See; God hath
sent us one, to show in practice that it is possible.
"Take notice of me, that I am without a country,
without a house, without an estate, without a servant;
I lie on the ground; have no wife, no children, no
coat; but have only earth and heaven and one poor
cloak. And what need I?  Am not I without sorrow,
without fear? Am not I free?  Did any of you ever
see me disappointed of my desire, or incurring my
aversion? Did I ever blame God or man? Did I
ever accuse any one?  Have any of you seen me look
discontented? How do I treat those whom you fear
and of whom you are struck with awe?  Is it not like
poor slaves? Who that sees me does not think that
he sees his own king and master? "  This is the language, this the character, this the undertaking, of a
Cynic. No, [but you think only of] the wallet and
the staff and a large capacity of swallowing and appropriating whatever is given you; abusing unseasonably
those you meet, or showing your bare arm. Do you
consider how you shall attempt so important an undertaking? First take a mirror. View your shoulders,
examine your back, your loins. It is the Olympic
Games, man, for which you are to be entered; not
a poor slight contest.  In the Olympic Games a
champion is not allowed merely to be conquered and
depart; but must first be disgraced in the view of
the whole world, -not of the Athenians alone, or
<pb id="p.2072"/>
Spartans, or Nicopolitans; and then he who has prematurely departed must be whipped too, and, before
that, must have suffered thirst and heat, and have
swallowed an abundance of dust.</p>
<p>Consider carefully, know yourself; consult the Divinity; attempt nothing without God; for if he counsels you, be assured that it is his will, whether that
you should become eminent, or that you should
suffer many a blow. For there is this fine circumstance connected with the character of a Cynic, that
he must be beaten like an ass, and yet, when beaten,
must love those who beat him as the father, as the
brother of all.</p>
<p>"No, to be sure; but if anybody beats you, stand
publicly and roar out, ' O Caesar ! am I to suffer such
things in breach of your peace?  Let us go before the
Proconsul.' "</p>
<p>But what is Caesar to a Cynic, or what is the Proconsul, or any one else, but Zeus, who hath deputed
him, and whom he serves?  Does he invoke any other
but him? And is he not persuaded that, whatever
he suffers of this sort, it is Zeus who doth it to exercise him?   Now Hercules, when he was exercised
by Eurystheus, did not think himself miserable: but
executed with alacrity all that was to be done. And
shall he who is appointed to the combat, and exercised by Zeus, cry out and take offence at things? A
worthy person, truly, to bear the sceptre of Diogenes !
Hear what he in a fever said to those who were pass-
<pb id="p.2073"/>
ing by.<note anchored="yes">St. Jerome, cited by Mr. Upton, gives the following somewhat different account of this matter. Diogenes, as he was going to the Olympic Games, was taken with a fever, and laid himself down in the road; his friends would have put him into some vehicle, but he refused it, and bid them go on to the show. " This night," said he, " I will either conquer or be conquered. If I conquer the fever, I will come to the games; if it conquers me, I will descend to Hades." - C.<cit><quote lang="la"><l>Si febrim vicero, ad Agonem veniam:</l>

you take such a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName> to see the destruction or combat of the champions; and have you
no inclination to see the combat between a man and
a fever?"   Such a one, who took a pride in difficult
circumstances, and thought himself worthy to be a
spectacle to those who passed by, was a likely per
son indeed to accuse God, who had deputed him, as
treating him unworthily! For what subject of accusation shall he find, - that he preserves a decency
of behavior? With what does he find fault, - that
he sets his own virtue in a clearer light?  Well; and
what does he say of poverty; of death; of pain i
How did he compare his happiness with that of the
Persian king; or rather, thought it beyond comparison ! For amidst perturbations, and griefs, and fears,
and disappointed desires, and incurred aversions, how
can there be any entrance for happiness? And where
there are corrupt principles, there must all these
things necessarily be.
<pb id="p.2074"/></p>
<p>-The same young man inquiring whether, if a
friend should desire to come to him and take care of
him when he was sick, he should comply?  And where,
says Epictetus, will you find me the friend of a Cynic?
For to be worthy of being numbered among his friends,
a person ought to be such another as himself; he
ought to be a partner of the sceptre and the kingdom,
and a worthy minister, if he would be honored with
his friendship; as Diogenes was the friend of Antisthenes; as Crates, of Diogenes. Do you think that
he who only comes to him and salutes him is his
friend; and that he will think him worthy of being
entertained as such? If such a thought comes into
your head, rather look round you for some desirable
dunghill to shelter you in your fever from the north
wind, that you may not perish by taking cold. But
you seem to me to prefer to get into somebody's
house, and to be well fed there awhile. What business have you, then, even to attempt so important an
undertaking as this?</p>
<p>" But," said the young man, " will marriage and parentage be recognized as important duties by a Cynic? "</p>
<p>Grant me a community of sages, and no one there,
perhaps, will readily apply himself to the Cynic philosophy.  For on whose account should he there
embrace that method of life? However, supposing
he does, there will be nothing to restrain him from
marrying and having children. For his wife will be
such another as himself, his father-in-law such another
<pb id="p.2075"/>
as himself, and his children will be brought up in the
same manner. But as the state of things now is, like
that of an army prepared for battle, is it not necessary
that a Cynic should be without distraction;<note anchored="yes">It is remarkable that Epictetus here uses the same word (<foreign lang="greek">a)perispa/stws</foreign>) with <placeName key="tgn,7014984">St. Paul</placeName>, 1 Cor. vii. 35, and urges the same consideration, of applying wholly to the service of God to dissuade from marriage.--C.</note> entirely
attentive to the service of God; at liberty to walk
among mankind; not tied down to common duties,
nor entangled in relations, which if he transgresses,
he will no longer keep the character of a wise and
good man; and which if he observes, there is an end
of him, as the messenger and spy and herald of the
gods? For consider, there are some offices due to
his father-in-law, some to the other relations of his
wife, some to his wife herself.  Besides, after this, he
is confined to the care of his family when sick, and to
providing for their support.  At the very least, he
must have a vessel to warm water in, to bathe his
child; there must be wool, oil, a bed, a cup for his
wife after her delivery; and thus the furniture increases; more business, more distraction.   Where,
for the future, is this king whose time is devoted to
the public good?-
<cit><quote><l>To whom the people is trusted, and many a care? </l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.25">Homer, Iliad, ii. 25.  H.</bibl></cit>
who ought to superintend others, married men,
fathers of children, - whether one treats his wife
<pb id="p.2076"/>
well or ill; who quarrels; which family is well regulated; which not, - like a physician who goes about
and feels the pulse of his patients: "You have a
fever; you the headache; you the gout. Do you
abstain from food; do you eat; do you omit bathing;
you must have an incision made; you be cauterized."
Where shall he have leisure for this who is tied down
to common duties? Must he not provide clothes for
his children, and send them, with pens and ink and
paper, to a schoolmaster? Must he not provide a bed
for them, - for they cannot be Cynics from their very
birth?  Otherwise, it would have been better to expose them as soon as they were born than to kill them
thus. Do you see to what we bring down our Cynic;
how we deprive him of his kingdom? "Well, but
Crates<note anchored="yes">Crates, a rich Theban, gave away a large fortune, and assumed the wallet and staff of a Cynic philosopher. Hipparchia, a Thracian lady, forsook wealth and friends to share his poverty, in spite of his advice to the contrary. Diogenes Laertius: Crates. - H.</note> was married." The case of which you speak
was a particular one, arising from love; and the
woman was another Crates.   But we are inquiring
about ordinary and common marriages; and in this
inquiry we do not find the affair much suited to the
condition of a Cynic.</p>
<l>How then shall he keep up society?</l>
<p>For Heaven's sake, do they confer a greater benefit
upon the world who leave two or three brats in their
stead, than those who, so far as possible, oversee all
<pb id="p.2077"/>
mankind,- what they do, how they live; what they
attend to, what they neglect, in spite of their duty?
Did all those who left children to the Thebans do
them more good than Epaminondas, who died childless? And did Priam, who was the father of fifty
profligates, or Danaus, or Aeolus, conduce more to
the advantage of society than Homer? Shall a military command, or any other post, then, exempt a
man from marrying and becoming a father, so that
he shall be thought to have made sufficient amends
for the want of children; and shall not the kingdom
of a Cynic be a proper compensation for it? Perhaps we do not understand his grandeur, nor duly
represent to ourselves the character of Diogenes; but
we think of Cynics as they are now, who stand like
dogs watching at tables, and who have only the lowest
things in common with the others; else things like
these would not move us, nor should we be astonished
that a Cynic will not marry nor have children. Consider, sir, that he is the father of mankind; that all
men are his sons, and all women his daughters. Thus
he attends to all; thus takes care of all. What! do
you think it is from impertinence that he rebukes
those he meets?  He does it as a father, as a brother,
as a minister of the common parent, Zeus.</p>
<p>Ask me, if you please, too, whether a Cynic will
engage in the administration of the commonwealth.
What commonwealth do you inquire after, foolish
man, greater than what he administers?  Why should
<pb id="p.2078"/>
he harangue among the Athenians about revenues
and taxes, whose business it is to debate with all
mankind, - with the Athenians, Corinthians, and
Romans equally,- not about taxes and revenues, or
peace and war, but about happiness and misery, prosperity and adversity, slavery and freedom?  Do you
ask me whether a man engages in the administration
of the commonwealth who administers such a commonwealth as this? Ask me, too, whether he will
accept any command. I will answer you again, What
command, foolish one, is greater than that which he
now exercises?</p>
<p>But he has need of a constitution duly qualified;
for if he should appear consumptive, thin, and pale,
his testimony has no longer the same authority. For
he must not only give a proof to the vulgar, by the
constancy of his mind, that it is possible to be a man
of weight and merit without those things that strike
<emph>them</emph> with admiration; but he must show, too, by his
body, that a simple and frugal diet, under the open
air, does no injury to the constitution. "See, I and
my body bear witness to this." As Diogenes did;
for he went about in hale condition, and gained the
attention of the many by his mere physical aspect.
But a Cynic in poor condition seems a mere beggar;
all avoid him, all are offended at him; for he ought
not to appear slovenly, so as to drive people from him;
but even his indigence should be clean and attractive.</p>
<p>Much natural tact and acuteness are likewise neces-
<pb id="p.2079"/>
sary in a Cynic (otherwise he is almost worthless),
that he may be able to give an answer, readily and
pertinently, upon every occasion.  So Diogenes, to
one who asked him, " Are you that Diogenes who does
not believe there are any gods?"  How so, replied
he, when I think <emph>you</emph> odious to them?  Again, when
Alexander surprised him sleeping, and repeated,--
<cit><quote><l>To sleep all the night becomes not a man who gives counsel;</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.24">Homer, Iliad, ii. 24, 25.- H.</bibl></cit>
before he was quite awake, he responded,-</p>
<p>"To whom the people is trusted, and many a care."</p>
<p>But, above all, the reason of the man must be
clearer than the sun; otherwise he must necessarily be
a common cheat and a rascal if, while himself guilty
of some vice, he reproves others. For consider how
the case stands. Arms and guards give a power to
common kings and tyrants of reproving and of punishing delinquents, though they be wicked themselves;
but to a Cynic, instead of arms and guards, conscience
gives this power. When he knows that he has watched
and labored for mankind; that he has slept pure,
and waked still purer; and that he hath regulated all
his thoughts as the friend, as the minister of the gods,
as a partner of the empire of Zeus; that he is ready
to say, upon all occasions, -
<cit><quote><l>Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,</l></quote> <bibl>Cleanthes, in Diogenes Laertius.- H.</bibl></cit>
<pb id="p.2080"/>
and, " If it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be,"
why should he not dare to speak boldly to his own
brethren, to his children; in a word, to his kindred?
Hence he who is thus qualified is neither impertinent nor a busybody; for he is not busied about the
affairs of others, but his own, when he oversees the
transactions of men. Otherwise call a general a busybody, when he oversees, inspects, and watches his soldiers and punishes the disorderly. But if you reprove
others at the very time that you have booty under
your own arm, I will ask you if you had not better go
into a corner, and eat up what you have stolen. But
what have you to do with the concerns of others?
For what are <emph>you</emph>?   Are you the bull in the herd, or
the queen of the bees?  Show me such ensigns of empire as she has from nature. But if you are a drone,
and arrogate to yourself the kingdom of the bees, do
you not think that your fellow-citizens will drive you
out, just as the bees do the drones?</p>
<p>A Cynic must, besides, have so much patience as to
seem insensible and like a stone to the vulgar. No
one reviles, no one beats, no one affronts <emph>him</emph>; but he
has surrendered his body to be treated at pleasure by
any one who will. For he remembers that the inferior,
in whatever respect it is the inferior, must be conquered
by the superior; and the body is inferior to the multitude, the weaker to the stronger. He never, therefore, enters into a combat where he can be conquered,
but immediately gives up what belongs to others; he
<pb id="p.2081"/>
does not claim what is slavish and dependent; but
in what concerns Will and the use of things as they
appear you will see that he has so many eyes, you
would say <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName> was blind to him. Is his assent ever
precipitate; his pursuits ever rash; his desire ever
disappointed; his aversion ever incurred; his aim
ever fruitless? Is he ever querulous, ever dejected,
ever envious? Here lies all his attention and application. With regard to other things, he enjoys profound
quiet. All is peace. There is no robber, no tyrant
for the Will. But there is for the body? Yes. The
estate? Yes. Magistracies and honors? Yes. And
what cares he for these? When any one, therefore,
would frighten him with them he says: "Go look for
children; masks are frightful to them; but <emph>I</emph> know
they are only shells, and have nothing within."</p>
<p>Such is the affair about which you are deliberating;
therefore, if you please, for Heaven's sake ! defer it,
and first consider how you are prepared for it. Observe what <placeName key="tgn,2383808">Hector</placeName> says to Andromache,--
<cit><quote><l>War is the sphere for all men, and for me.</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Il. 6.492">Homer, Iliad, vi. 492, 493.- H.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Thus conscious was he of his own qualifications and
of her weakness.

<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Concerning such as read and dispute ostentatiously.</head>
<p>First, say to yourself what you would be; and
then do what you have to do. For in almost
everything we see this to be the practice. Olympic
champions first determine what they would be, and
then act accordingly. To a racer in a longer course
there must be one kind of diet, walking, anointing,
and training; to one in a shorter, all these must be
different; and to a Pentathlete, still more different.
You will find the case the same in the manual arts.
If a carpenter, you must have such and such things;
if a smith, such other. For if we do not refer each of
our actions to some end, we shall act at random; if to
an improper one, we shall miss our aim. Further,
there is a general and a particular end. The first is,
to act as a man. What is comprehended in this?
To be gentle, yet not sheepish; not to be mischievous,
like a wild beast. But the particular end relates to
the study and choice of each individual. A harper is
to act as a harper; a carpenter, as a carpenter; a
philosopher, as a philosopher; an orator, as an orator.
When, therefore, you say, "Come, and hear me discourse," observe, first, not to do this at random; and,
<pb id="p.2083"/>
in the next place, after you have found to what end
you refer it, consider whether it be a proper one.
Would you be useful, or be praised? You presently hear him say, "What do -I value the praise
of the multitude?"  And he says well; for this is
nothing to a musician, or a geometrician, as such.
You would be useful then. In what? Tell us, that
we too may run to make part of your audience. Now,
is it possible for any one to benefit others, who has
received no benefit himself? No; for neither can
he who is not a carpenter, or a shoemaker, benefit
any one in respect to those arts. Would you know,
then, whether you have received benefit? Produce
your principles, philosopher. What is the aim and
promise of desire? Not to be disappointed. What
of aversion? Not to be incurred.  Come, do we
fulfil this promise? Tell me the truth; but, if you
falsify, I will tell it to <emph>you</emph>. The other day, when your
audience came but coldly together, and did not receive what you said with acclamations of applause,
you went away dejected.  Again, the other day when
you were praised, you went about asking everybody,
" What did you think of me? "  " Upon my life, sir,
it was prodigious."  "But how did I express myself
upon that subject?"  "Which?" "Where I gave
a description of Pan and the Nymphs."<note anchored="yes">Mr. Upton observes that these florid descriptions were the principal study of the Sophists. - C.</note> "Most
excellently." And do you tell me, after this, that you
<pb id="p.2084"/>
regulate your desires and aversions conformably to
Nature?  Get you gone ! Persuade somebody else.</p>
<p>Did not you, the other day, praise a man contrary
to your own opinion? Did not you flatter a certain
senator? Yet would you wish your own children to
be like him?  "Heaven forbid!" Why then did
you praise and cajole him?  "He is an ingenuous
young man, and attentive to discourses."  How so?
"He admires <emph>me</emph>."  Now indeed you have produced
your proof.</p>
<p>After all, what do you think? Do not these very
people secretly despise you? When a man conscious
of no good action or intention finds some philosopher
saying, "You are a great genius, and of a frank and
candid disposition," what do you think he says, but,
"This man has some need of me"? Pray tell me
what mark of a great genius he has shown. You
see he has long conversed with you, has heard your
discourses, has attended your lectures. Has he turned
his attention to himself? Has he perceived his own
faults? Has he thrown off his conceit? Does he
seek an instructor?  "Yes, he does."  An instructor
how to live?  No, fool, but how to talk; for it is
upon this account that he admires you. Hear what
he says: "This man writes with very great art, and
much more finely than Dion."  That is quite another
thing. Does he say, This is a modest, faithful, calm
person? But if he said this too, I would ask him, if
be is faithful, what it is to be faithful? And if he
<pb id="p.2085"/>
could not tell, I would add, "First learn the meaning
of what you say, and then speak."</p>
<p>While you are in this bad disposition, then, and
gaping after applauders, and counting your hearers,
can you be of benefit to others?  "To-day I had
many more hearers." "Yes, many; we think there
were five hundred."  "You say nothing; estimate
them at a thousand."  "Dion never had so great an
audience."  "How should he?"  "And they have
a fine taste for discourses."  "What is excellent,
sir, will move even a stone." Here is the language
of a philosopher! Here is the disposition of one who
is to be beneficial to mankind ! Here is the man,
attentive to discourses, who has read the works of
the Socratic philosophers, as such; not as if they were
the writings of orators, like Lysias and Isocrates! " I
have often wondered by what arguments-   "<note anchored="yes">These words are the beginning of Xenophon's Memoirs of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>; and it was a debate among the minute critics, whether <emph>argument</emph> or <emph>arguments</emph> was the proper reading. - C.</note> No;
"By what argument; " that is the more perfectly
accurate expression. Is this to have read them any
otherwise than as you read little pieces of poetry?
If you read them as you ought, you would not dwell
on such trifles, but would rather consider such a
passage as this: "Anytus and Melitus may kill, but
they cannot hurt me." And " I am always so disposed as to defer to none of my friends, but to that
reason which, after examination, appears to me to
<pb id="p.2086"/>
be the best."<note anchored="yes">Plato, Apology, 18 ; Crito, 6. -H.</note> Hence, whoever heard <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> say,
" I know, or teach anything"?  But he sent different people to different instructors; they came to him,
desiring to be introduced to the philosophers; and
he took them and introduced them. No; but [you
think] as he accompanied them he used to give them
such advice as this: "Hear <emph>me</emph> discourse to-day at
the house of Quadratus." Why should I hear you?
Have you a mind to show me how finely you put
words together, sir? And what good does that do
you?  "But praise me."   What do you mean by
praising you?  "Say, Incomparable ! prodigious!"
Well; I do say it. But if praise be that which the
philosophers call by the appellation of <emph>good</emph>, what
have I to praise you for?  If it be good to speak
well, teach me, and I will praise you. "What, then;
ought these things to be heard without pleasure?"
By no means. I do not hear even a harper without
pleasure; but am I therefore to devote myself to playing upon the harp? Hear what <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> says to his
judges: <emph>"It</emph> would not be decent for me to appear
before you, at this age, composing speeches like a
boy."<note anchored="yes">Plato, Apology, 1. - H.</note> Like a boy, he says. For it is, without
doubt, a pretty accomplishment to select words and
place them together, and then to read or speak them
gracefully in public; and in the midst of the discourse to observe that "he vows by all that is good,
<pb id="p.2087"/>
there are but few capable of these things." But does
a philosopher apply to people to hear him? Does
he not attract those who are fitted to receive benefit
from him, in the same -manner as the sun or their
necessary food does?  What physician applies to anybody to be cured by him? (Though now indeed I
hear that the physicians at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> apply for patients;
but in my time they were applied to.)  "I apply to
you to come and hear that you are in a bad way,
and that you take care of everything but what you
ought; that you know not what is good or evil, and
are unfortunate and unhappy." A fine application!
And yet, unless the discourse of a philosopher has
this effect, both that and the speaker are lifeless.</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,2633121">Rufus</placeName> used to say, " If you are at leisure to praise
me, I speak to no purpose." And indeed he used to
speak in such a manner, that each of us who heard
him supposed that some person had accused us to
him; he so precisely hit upon what was done by us,
and placed the faults of every one before his eyes.</p>
<p>The school of a philosopher is a surgery. You are
not to go out of it with pleasure, but with pain; for
you do not come there in health; but one of you has
a dislocated shoulder; another, an abscess; a third,
a fistula; a fourth, the headache. And am I, then, to
sit uttering pretty, trifling thoughts and little exclamations, that, when you have praised me, you may
each of you go away with the same dislocated shoulder, the same aching head, the same fistula. and the
<pb id="p.2088"/>
same abscess that you brought? And is it for this
that young men are to travel? And do they leave
their parents, their friends, their relations, and their
estates, that they may praise you while you are uttering little exclamations? Was this the practice of
<placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>; of <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName>; of Cleanthes?</p>
<p>What then ! is there not in speaking a style and
manner of exhortation? Who denies it? Just as
there is a manner of confutation and of instruction.
But who ever, therefore, added that of <emph>ostentation</emph> for
a fourth? For in what doth the hortatory manner
consist? In being able to show, to one and all, the
contradictions in which they are involved; and that
they care for everything rather than what they mean
to care for; for they mean the things conducive to
happiness, but they seek them where they are not to
be found. To effect this, must a thousand seats be
placed, and an audience invited; and you, in a fine
robe or cloak, ascend the rostrum, and describe the
death of Achilles? Forbear, for Heaven's sake ! to
bring, so far as you are able, good works and practices into disgrace. Nothing, to be sure, gives more
force to exhortation than when the speaker shows
that he has need of the hearers; but tell me who,
when he hears you reading or speaking, is solicitous
about <emph>himself</emph>; or turns his attention upon himself;
or says, when he is gone away, "The philosopher hit
me well "? Instead of this, even though you are in
high vogue, one hearer merely remarks to another,
<pb id="p.2089"/>
" He spoke finely about Xerxes! "  "No," says the
other; " but on the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2716872">Thermopylae</placeName>!"  Is this
the audience for a philosopher?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<head>That we ought not to be affected by things not in our own power.</head>
<p>Let not another's disobedience to Nature become
an ill to you; for you were not born to be depressed and unhappy with others, but to be happy
with them. And if any is unhappy, remember that
he is so for himself; for God made all men to enjoy
felicity and peace. He hath furnished all with means
for this purpose; having given them some things for
their own, others not for their own. Whatever is
subject to restraint, compulsion, or deprivation is not
their own; whatever is not subject to restraint is
their own. And the essence of good and evil he
has placed in things which are our own, as it became
him who provides for, and protects us, with paternal
care.</p>
<p>"But I have parted with such a one, and he is
therefore in grief."</p>
<p>And why did he esteem what belonged to another
his own? Why did he not consider, while he was
happy in seeing you, that you are mortal, that you
<pb id="p.2090"/>
are liable to change your abode?  Therefore he bears
the punishment of his own folly. But to what purpose, or for what cause, do you too suffer depression
of spirits? Have <emph>you</emph> not studied these things? Like
trifling, silly women, have you regarded the things
you took delight in, the places, the persons, the conversations, as if they were to last for ever; and do
you now sit crying, because you do not see the same
people, nor live in the same place? Indeed, you deserve to be so overcome, and thus to become more
wretched than ravens or crows, which, without groaning or longing for their former state, can fly where
they will, build their nests in another place, and cross
the seas.</p>
<p>"Ay, but this happens from their want of reason."</p>
<p>Was reason then given to us by the gods for the
purpose of unhappiness and misery, to make us live
wretched and lamenting? Oh, by all means, let every
one be deathless! Let nobody go from home ! Let
us never go from home ourselves, but remain rooted
to a spot, like plants! And if any of our acquaintance should quit his abode, let us sit and cry; and
when he comes back, let us dance and clap our hands
like children. Shall we never wean ourselves, and
remember what we have heard from the philosophers, - unless we have heard them only as juggling
enchanters, - that the universe is one great city,
and the substance one of which it is formed; that
there must necessarily be a certain rotation of things;
<pb id="p.2091"/>
that some must give way to others, some be dissolved,
and others rise in their stead; some remain in the
same situation, and others be moved; but that all is
full of beloved ones, first of the gods, and then of
men, by nature endeared to each other; that some
must be separated, others live together, rejoicing in
the present, and not grieving for the absent; and
that man, besides a natural greatness of mind and
contempt of things independent on his own will, is
likewise formed not to be rooted to the earth, but to
go at different times to different places; sometimes on
urgent occasions, and sometimes merely for the sake
of observation. Such was the case of Odysseus, who
<cit><quote><l>Saw the cities and watched the habits of various men;</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.3">Homer, Odyssey, 1.3.</bibl></cit> - H.
and, even before him, of <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName>, to travel over the
habitable world,
<cit><quote><l>Observing manners, good or ill, of men ;</l></quote> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 15.487">Hom. Od. 15.487. - H.</bibl></cit>
to expel and clear away the one, and, in its stead,
to introduce the other. Yet how many friends do
you not think he must have at <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>; how many
at <placeName key="tgn,7010720">Argos</placeName>; how many at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>; and how many did
he acquire in his travels? He married, too, when
he thought it a proper time, and became a father, and
then quitted his children; not lamenting and longing
for them, nor as if he had left them orphans; for he
knew that no human creature is an orphan, but that
<pb id="p.2092"/>
there is a father who always, and without intermission, takes care of all. For he had not merely heard
it as matter of talk, that Zeus was the Father of
Mankind; but he esteemed and called him his own
Father, and performed all that he did with a view to
him. Hence he was, in every place, able to live
happy. But it is never possible to make happiness
consistent with a longing after what is not present.
For true happiness implies the possession of all which
is desired, as in case of satiety with food; there must
be no thirst, no hunger.</p>
<p>" But Odysseus longed for his wife, and sat weeping
on a rock."</p>
<p>Why do you regard Homer and his fables in everything? Or, if Odysseus really did weep, what was he
but a wretched man? But what wise and good man
is wretched? The universe is surely but ill governed,
if Zeus does not take care that his subjects may be
happy like himself. But these are unlawful and profane thoughts; and Odysseus, if he did indeed cry and
bewail himself, was not a good man. For who can
be a good man who does not know what he is? And
who knows this, and yet forgets that all things made
are perishable; and that it is not possible for man
and man always to live together? What then? To
desire impossibilities is base and foolish; it is the behavior of a stranger [to the world]; of one who fights
against God in the only way he can, by holding false
principles.
<pb id="p.2093"/></p>
<p>"But my mother grieves when she does not see
me."</p>
<p>And why has she not learned these doctrines? I
do not say that care ought not to be taken that she
may not lament; but that we are not to insist absolutely upon what is not in our own power. Now, the
grief of another is not in my power; but my own
grief is. I will therefore absolutely suppress my own,
for that is in my power; and I will endeavor to suppress another's grief so far as I am able; but I will
not insist upon it absolutely, otherwise I shall fight
against God; I shall resist Zeus, and oppose him
in the administration of the universe; and not only
my children's children will bear the punishment of
this disobedience and fighting against God, but I
myself too, - starting, and full of perturbation, both
in the day-time and in my nightly dreams; trembling
at every message, and having my peace dependent on
intelligence from others. "Somebody is come from
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>."   "I trust no harm has happened."  Why,
what harm can happen to you where you are not?
"From  Greece." "No harm, I hope."   Why, at
this rate, every place may be the cause of misfortune to you. Is it not enough for you to be unfortunate where you are, but it must happen beyond sea,
too, and by letters?  Such is the security of your
condition !</p>
<p>" But what if my friends there should be dead? "</p>
<p>What, indeed, but that those are dead who were
<pb id="p.2094"/>
born to die? Do you at once wish to grow old, and
yet not to see the death of any one you love?  Do you
not know that, in a long course of time, many and
various events must necessarily happen; that a fever
must get the better of one, a highwayman of another,
a tyrant of a third?  For such is the world we live in;
such they who live in it with us. Heats and colds,
improper diet, journeys, voyages, winds, and various
accidents destroy some, banish others; destine one to
an embassy, another to a camp. And now, pray, will
you sit in consternation about all these things, lamenting, disappointed, wretched, dependent on another;
and not on one or two only, but ten thousand times
ten thousand?</p>
<p>Is this what you have heard from the philosophers;
this what you have learned? Do you not know what
sort of a thing warfare is? One must keep guard,
another go out for a spy, another even to battle. It
is neither possible, nor indeed desirable, that all should
be in the same place; but you, neglecting to perform
the orders of your General, complain whenever anything a little hard is commanded; and do not consider what influence you have on the army, so far as
lies in your power. For, if all should imitate you,
nobody will dig a trench, or throw up a rampart, or
stand guard, or expose himself to danger; but every
one will appear useless to the expedition. Again, if
you were a sailor in a voyage, suppose you were to fix
upon one place, and there remain, -if it should be
<pb id="p.2095"/>
necessary to climb the mast, refuse to do it; if to run
to the bow of the ship, refuse to do it! And what
captain would tolerate you? Would he not throw you
overboard as a useless piece of goods and mere luggage,.and a bad example to the other sailors? Thus,
also, in the present case; every one's life is a warfare,
and that long and various.  You must observe the
duty of a soldier, and perform everything at the nod
of your General, and even, if possible, divine what he
would have done. For there is no comparison between the above-mentioned General and this whom
you now obey, either in power or excellence of character. You are placed in an extensive command, and
not in a mean post; your life is a perpetual magistracy? Do you not know that such a one must spend
but little time on his affairs at home, but be much
abroad, either commanding or obeying; attending on
the duties either of a magistrate, a soldier, or a judge?
And now, pray, would you be fixed and rooted on the
same spot, like a plant?</p>
<p>" Why; it is pleasant."</p>
<p>Who denies it? And so is a ragout pleasant, and
a fine woman is pleasant. Is not this just what they
say who make pleasure their end?  Do you not perceive whose language you have spoken? That of
Epicureans and debauchees. And while you follow
their practices and hold their principles, do you talk
to us of the doctrines of Zeno and Socrates? Why do
you not throw away as far as possible those assumed
<pb id="p.2096"/>
traits which belong to others, and with which you
have nothing to do? What else do the Epicureans
desire than to sleep without hindrance, and rise without compulsion; and when they have risen, to yawn
at their leisure and wash their faces; then write and
read what they please; then prate about some trifle
or other, and be applauded by their friends, whatever
they say; then go out for a walk, and, after they have
taken a turn, bathe, and then eat, and then to bed?
In what manner they spend their time there, why
should one say?  For it is easily guessed. Come
now; do you also tell me what course of life you
desire to lead, who are a zealot for truth, and Diogenes, and Socrates?  What would you do at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>,-
these very same things? Why then do you call yourself a Stoic? They who falsely pretend to the Roman
citizenship are punished severely; and must those be
dismissed with impunity who falsely claim so great a
thing, and so venerable a title, as you? Or is not
this impossible; and is there not a divine and powerful and inevitable law, which exacts the greatest punishments from those who are guilty of the greatest
offences?  For what says this law? - Let him who
claims what belongs not to him be arrogant, be vainglorious, be base, be a slave; let him grieve, let him
envy, let him pity; and, in a word, let him lament and
be miserable.</p>
<p>"What then! would you have me pay my court to
such a one? Would you have me frequent his door? "
<pb id="p.2097"/></p>
<p>If reason requires it for your country, for your relations, for mankind, why should you not go? You are
not ashamed to go to the door of a shoemaker when
you want shoes, nor of a gardener when you want
lettuce. Why, then, in regard to the rich, when you
have some similar want?</p>
<p>" Ay; but I need not be awed before a shoemaker."
Nor before a rich man.
" I need not flatter a gardener."
Nor a rich man.
" How, then, shall I get what I want?"</p>
<p>Why, do I bid you go in expectation of getting it?
No; only that you may do your duty.</p>
<p>"Why, then, after all, should I go?"</p>
<p>That you may have gone; that you may have discharged the duties of a citizen, of a brother, of a
friend. And, after all, remember that you are going
as if to a shoemaker, to a gardener, who has no monopoly of anything great or respectable, though he
should sell it ever so dear. You are going as if to
buy lettuces worth an obolus, but by no means worth
a talent. So here, too, if the matter is worth going to
his door about, I will go; if it is worth talking with
him about, I will talk with him. But if one must kiss
his hand, too, and cajole him with praise, that is paying too dear. It is not expedient for myself, nor my
country, nor my fellow-citizens, nor my friends, to
destroy what constitutes the good citizen and the
friend.
<pb id="p.2098"/></p>
<p>" But one will appear not to have set heartily about
the business, if one thus fails."</p>
<p>What, have you again forgotten why you went?
Do you not know that a wise and good man does
nothing for appearance, but everything for the sake
of having acted well?</p>
<p>" What advantage is it, then, to him, to have acted
well?"</p>
<p>What advantage is it to one who writes down
the name of <placeName key="tgn,1123427">Dion</placeName> without a blunder? The having
written it.</p>
<p>" Is there no reward, then? "</p>
<p>Why, do you seek any greater reward for a good
man than the doing what is fair and just? And yet,
at <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>, you desire nothing else, but think it
enough to be crowned victor. Does it appear to you
so small and worthless a thing to be just, good, and
happy? Besides, being introduced by God into this
Great City [the world], and bound to discharge at this
time the duties of a man, do you still want nurses and
a mamma; and are you conquered and effeminated by
the tears of poor weak women? Are you thus determined never to cease being an infant? Do not you
know that, if one acts like a child, the older he is, so
much the more he is ridiculous?</p>
<p>Did you never visit any one at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> at his own
house?</p>
<p>"Yes; whomsoever I pleased."
Why, now you are here, be willing to visit this per-
<pb id="p.2099"/>
son, and you will still see whom you please; only let it
be without meanness, without undue desire or aversion, and your affairs will go well; but their going
well, or not, does not consist in going to the house and
standing at the door, or the contrary; but lies within,
in your own principles, when you have acquired a
contempt for things uncontrollable by Will, and esteem none of them your own, but hold that what
belongs to you is only to judge and think, to exert
rightly your aims, your desires, and aversions. What
further room is there after this for flattery, for meanness? Why do you still long for the quiet you elsewhere enjoyed; for places familiar to you? Stay a
little, and these will become familiar to you in their
turn; and then, if you are so mean-spirited, you may
weep and lament again on leaving these.</p>
<p>"How, then, am I to preserve an affectionate disposition? "</p>
<p>As becomes a noble-spirited and happy person.
For reason will never tell you to be dejected and
broken-hearted, or to depend on another, or to reproach either God or man. Be affectionate in such
a manner as to observe all this. But if, from affection, as you call it, you are to be a slave and miserable, it is not worth your while to be affectionate. And
what restrains you from loving any one as a mortal, -
as a person who may be obliged to quit you? Pray
did not Socrates love his own children? But it was
as became one who was free, and mindful that his
<pb id="p.2100"/>
first duty was to gain the love of the gods. Hence
he violated no part of the character of a good man,
either in his defence or in fixing a penalty on himself.<note anchored="yes">It was the custom at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, in cases where no fixed punishment was appointed by the law, before the judges gave sentence, to ask the criminal himself what penalty he thought he deserved. Socrates refused either to comply with this form himself, or suffer any of his friends to do it for him; alleging that the naming a penalty was a confession of guilt.  When the judges therefore asked him what penalty he thought he deserved, he answered, " The highest honors and rewards, and to be maintained in the Prytaneum at the public expense,"an answer which so extremely irritated his judges, that they immediately condemned him to death. -C.</note>
Nor yet before, when he was a senator or a soldier.
But <emph>we</emph> make use of every pretence to be mean-spirited; some on account of a child; some, of a mother;
and some, of a brother. But it is not fit to be unhappy on account of any one, but happy on account
of all; and chiefly of God, who has constituted us for
this purpose.   What! did Diogenes love nobody,
who was so gentle and benevolent as cheerfully to
undergo so many pains and miseries of body for
the common good of mankind? Yes, he did love
them; but how? As became a minister of Zeus; at
once caring for men, and obedient to God. Hence
the whole earth, not any particular place, was his
country. And when he was taken captive he did not
long for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and his friends and acquaintance
there, but made himself acquainted with the pirates,
and endeavored to reform them; and when he was at
<pb id="p.2101"/>
last sold into captivity, he lived at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> just as
before at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; and if he had gone to the Perrhaebeans,<note anchored="yes">A people towards the extremity of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. -C.</note> he would have been exactly the same. Thus
is freedom acquired. Hence he used to say, "Ever
since Antisthenes made me free<note anchored="yes">Diogenes was the disciple of Antisthenes. -C.</note> I have ceased to be
a slave." How did <emph>he</emph> make him free? Hear what
he says: " He taught me what was my own and what
not. An estate is not my own. Kindred, domestics
friends, reputation, familiar places, manner of life, all
belong to another."  "What is your own, then?"
" The right use of the phenomena of existence. He
showed me that I have <emph>this</emph>, not subject to restraint or
compulsion; no one can hinder or force me in this,
any otherwise than as I please. Who, then, after this,
has any power over me, - Philip, or Alexander, or
Perdiccas, or the Persian king?  Whence should they
have it? For he that is to be subdued by man must
first be subdued by things. He, therefore, of whom
neither pleasure, nor pain, nor fame, nor riches can
get the better; and he who is able, whenever he thinks
fit, to abandon his whole body with contempt and depart, whose slave can he ever be?  To whom is he subject? " But if Diogenes had taken pleasure in living
at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and had been subdued by that manner of
life, his affairs would have been at every one's disposal; and whoever was stronger would have had the
power of grieving him. How would he have flattered
<pb id="p.2102"/>
the pirates, think you, to make them sell him to some
Athenian, that he might see again the fine Piraus,
the Long Walls, and the Citadel? How would you
see them, - as a slave and a miserable wretch?  And
what good would that do you?  " No; but as free."
How free? See, somebody lays hold on you, takes
you away from your usual manner of life, and says:
"You are my slave; for it is in my power to restrain you from living as you like. It is in my power
to afflict and humble you. Whenever I please you
may be cheerful once more, and set out elated for
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>." What do you say to him who thus enslaves
you?  What rescuer can you find?  Or dare you not
so much as look up at him; but, without making
many words, do you supplicate to be dismissed?
Why, you ought even to go to prison, man, with alacrity, with speed, outstripping your conductors. Instead of this do you regret living at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and long
for <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>?  And when you must die, will you then,
too, come crying to us that you shall no more see
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, nor walk in the Lyceum? Is it for this that
you have travelled? Is it for this that you have been
seeking for somebody to do you good?  What good,
- that you may the more easily solve syllogisms and
manage hypothetical arguments? And is it for this
reason you left your brother, your country, your
friends, your family, that you might carry back such
acquirements as these?  So that you did not travel to
learn constancy nor tranquillity; not that. secured
<pb id="p.2103"/>
from harm, you might complain of no one, accuse no
one; that no one might injure you; and that thus
you might preserve your human relations, without
impediment. You have made a fine traffic of it, to
carry home hypothetical arguments and convertible
propositions! If you please, too, sit in the market,
and cry them for sale, as mountebanks do their medicines. Why will you not rather deny that you know
even what you have learned, for fear of bringing
a scandal upon such theorems as useless?  What
harm has philosophy done you, - in what has Chrysippus injured you, - that you should demonstrate by
your actions that such studies are of no value? Had
you not evils enough at home?  How many causes for
grief and lamentation had you there, even if you had
not travelled? But you have added more; and if
you ever get any new acquaintance and friends, you
will find fresh causes for groaning; and, in like manner, if you attach yourself to any other country. To
what purpose, therefore, do you live, - to heap sorrow upon sorrow, to make you wretched?  And then
you tell me this is affection. What affection, man?
If it be good, it cannot be the cause of any ill; if ill, I
will have nothing to do with it. I was born for my
own good, not ill.</p>
<p>"What, then, is the proper training for these
cases? "</p>
<p>First, the highest and principal means, and as obvious as if at your very door, is this, - that when you
<pb id="p.2104"/>
attach yourself to anything, it may not be as to a
secure possession.</p>
<p>"How, then?"</p>
<p>As to something brittle as glass or earthenware;
that when it happens to be broken, you may not lose
your self-command. So here, too, when you embrace your child, or your brother, or your friend,
never yield yourself wholly to the fair semblance, nor
let the passion pass into excess; but curb it, restrain
it, - like those who stand behind triumphant victors,
and remind them that they are men. Do you likewise remind yourself that you love what is mortal;
that you love what is not your own. It is allowed
you for the present, not irrevocably, nor forever;
but as a fig, or a bunch of grapes, in the appointed
season. If you long for these in winter, you are foolish. So, if you long for your son, or your friend,
when you cannot have him, remember that you are
wishing for figs in winter. For as winter is to a fig,
so is every accident in the universe to those things
with which it interferes. In the next place, whatever objects give you pleasure, call before yourself the
opposite images. What harm is there, while you
kiss your child, in saying softly, "To-morrow you
may die ; " and so to your friend, " To-morrow either
you or I may go away, and we may see each other
no more "?</p>
<p>" But these sayings are ominous."</p>
<p>And so are some incantations; but because they
<pb id="p.2105"/>
are useful, I do not mind it; only let them be useful.
But do you call anything ominous except what implies some ill? Cowardice is ominous; baseness is
ominous; lamentation, grief, shamelessness. These
are words of bad omen; and yet we ought not to
shrink from using them, as a guard against the things
they mean. But do you tell me that a word is ominous which is significant of anything natural? Say,
too, that it is ominous for ears of corn to be reaped;
for this signifies the destruction of the corn, but not
of the world. Say, too, that the fall of the leaf is
ominous; and that confectionery should be produced
from figs, and raisins from grapes. For all these are
changes from a former state into another, - not a destruction, but a certain appointed economy and administration. Such is absence, a slight change; such
is death, a greater change, -not from what now is
nothing, but to what now is not.</p>
<p>" What, then; shall I be no more? "</p>
<p>True; but you will be something else, of which at
present the world has no need; for even <emph>you</emph> were
not produced when you pleased, but when the world
had need of you. Hence a wise and good man, mindful who he is and whence he came, and by whom
he was produced, is attentive only how he may fill
his post regularly and dutifully before God. "Dost
thou wish me still to live? Let me live free and
noble, as thou desirest; for thou hast made me
incapable of restraint in what is my own. But hast
<pb id="p.2106"/>
thou no further use for me?   Farewell! I have
stayed thus long through thee alone, and no other;
and now I depart in obedience to thee."  "How
do you depart?"  "Still as thou wilt; as one free,
as thy servant, as one sensible of thy commands and
thy prohibitions. But, while I am employed in thy
service, what wouldst thou have me to be, - a prince,
or a private man; a senator, or a plebeian; a soldier,
or a general; a preceptor, or a master of a family?
Whatever post or rank thou shalt assign me, like
Socrates, I will die a thousand times rather than
desert it.  <emph>Where</emph> wouldst thou have me to be, - at
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, or at Gyaros? Only
remember me there. If thou shalt send me where
men cannot live conformably to nature, I will not
depart unbidden, but upon a recall as it were sounded
by thee. Even then I do not desert thee; Heaven
forbid ! but I perceive that thou hast no use for me.
If a life conformable to nature be granted, I will seek
no other place but that in which I am, nor any other
company but those with whom I dwell."</p>
<p>Let these things be ready at hand, night and day.
These things write; these things read; of these things
talk both to yourself and others. [Ask them,] " Have
you any assistance to give me for this purpose?"
And, again, go and ask another and another. Then,
if any of those things should happen that are called
disagreeable, this will surely be a relief to you, in
the first place, that it was not unexpected. For it is
<pb id="p.2107"/>
much to be able always to say, " I knew that I begot
one born to die." <note anchored="yes">This was said by Xenophon, when news was brought him that his son Gryllus was killed in a battle. -- C.</note> Thus do you say too, " I knew
that I was liable to die, to travel, to be exiled, to be
imprisoned." If afterwards you turn to yourself, and
seek from what quarter the event proceeds, you will
presently recollect: "It is from things uncontrollable
by will, not from what is my own. What then is it
to me?" Then, further, which is the chief point:
"Who sent this, - the commander, the general, the
city, the public law? Give it to me, then, for I must
always obey the law in all things."</p>
<p>Further yet, when any delusive appearance molests
you (for this may not depend on you), strive against
it, and conquer it through reason. Do not suffer it
to gain strength, nor to lead you indefinitely on,
beguiling you at its own will. If you are at Gyaros,
do not represent to yourself the manner of living at
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, - how many pleasures you used to find there,
and how many would attend your return; but dwell
rather on this point, - how he who must live at Gyaros may live there nobly. And if you are at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
do not represent to yourself the manner of living at
<placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; but consider only how you ought to live
where you are.</p>
<p>Lastly, for all other pleasures substitute the consciousness that you are obeying God, and performing
not in word, but in deed, the duty of a wise and good
<pb id="p.2108"/>
man.   How great a thing is it to be able to say to
yourself: " What others are now solemnly arguing in
the schools, and can state in paradoxes, this I put in
practice. Those qualities which are there discoursed,
disputed, celebrated, I have made mine own. Zeus
hath been pleased to let me recognize this within
myself, and himself to discern whether he hath in
me one fit for a soldier and a citizen, and to employ
me as a witness to other men, concerning things uncontrollable by will. See that your fears were vain,
your appetites vain. Seek not good from without;
seek it within yourselves, or you will never find it.
For this reason he now brings me hither, now sends
me thither; sets me before mankind, poor, powerless,
sick; banishes me to Gyaros; leads me to prison;
not that he hates me, - Heaven forbid! for who
hates the most faithful of his servants? - nor that he
neglects me, for he neglects not one of the smallest
things; but to exercise me, and make use of me as
a witness to others.  Appointed to such a service,
do I still care where I am, or with whom, or what
is said of me, - instead of being wholly attentive to
God and to his orders and commands?"</p>
<p>Having these principles always at hand, and practising them by yourself, and making them ready for
use, you will never want any one to comfort and
strengthen you. For shame does not consist in having nothing to eat, but in not having wisdom enough
to exempt you from fear and sorrow.  But if you
<pb id="p.2109"/>
once acquire that exemption, will a tyrant or his
guards or courtiers be anything to you?  Will offices
or office-seekers disturb you, who have received so
great a command from Zeus? Only do not make
a parade over it, nor grow insolent upon it; but
show it by your actions; and though no one else
should notice it, be content that you are well and
blessed.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<head>Concerning those who waver in their purpose.</head>
<p>Consider which of your undertakings you have
fulfilled, which not, and wherefore; which give
you pleasure, which pain, in the reflection; and, if
possible, recover yourself where you have failed. For
the champions in this greatest of combats must not
grow weary, but should even contentedly bear chastisement.  For this is no combat of wrestling or boxing, where both he who succeeds and he who fails
may possibly be of very great worth or of little, indeed may be very fortunate or very miserable, but
this combat is for good fortune and happiness itself.
What is the case, then? Here, even if we have renounced the contest, no one restrains us from renewing it, nor need we wait for another four years for
the return of another Olympiad; but recollecting
<pb id="p.2110"/>
and recovering yourself, and returning with the same
zeal, you may renew it immediately; and even if you
should again yield, you may again begin; and if you
once get the victory, you become like one who has
never yielded. Only do not begin by forming the
habit of this, to do it with pleasure, and then, like
quails that have fled the fighting-pit, go about as if
you were a brave champion, although you have been
conquered throughout all the games. "I am conquered in presence of a girl.  But what of it?  I
have been thus conquered before."  "I am excited
to wrath against some one. But I have been in anger
before." You talk to us just as if you had come off
unhurt. As if one should say to his physician, who
had forbidden him to bathe, " Why, did not I bathe
before?"  Suppose the physician should answer him,
"&lt; Well, and what was the consequence of your bathing?
Were you not feverish?  Had you not the headache?  "
So, when you before railed at somebody, did you not
act like an ill-natured person; like an impertinent
one? Have not you fed this habit of yours by corresponding actions? When you were conquered by a
pretty girl, did you come off with impunity? Why,
then, do you talk of what you have done before?
You ought to remember it, I think, as slaves do whipping, so as to refrain from the same faults. "But the
case is unlike; for there it is pain that causes the remembrance. But what is the pain, what the punishment, of my committing these faults? For when was

<pb id="p.2111"/>
I ever thus trained to the avoidance of bad actions? "
Yet the pains of experience, whether we will or not,
have their beneficial influence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<head>Concerning those who are in dread of want.</head>
<p>Are not you ashamed to be more fearful and
mean-spirited than fugitive slaves?  To what
estates, to what servants, do they trust, when they run
away and leave their masters? Do they not, after
carrying off a little with them for the first days, travel
over land and sea, contriving first one, then another,
method of getting food? And what fugitive ever died
of hunger? But <emph>you</emph> tremble, and lie awake at night,
for fear you should want necessaries. Foolish man !
are you so blind?  Do not you see the way whither
the want of necessaries leads?</p>
<p>"Why, whither does it lead?"</p>
<p>Whither a fever or a falling stone may lead, --to
death. Have you not, then, often said this to your
companions?   Have you not read, have you not
written, many things on this point? And how often
have you arrogantly boasted that you are undisturbed
by fears of death !</p>
<p rend="right">"Ay; but my family, too, will perish with hunger."
<pb id="p.2112"/></p>
<p>What then?  Does their hunger lead any other way
than yours? Is there not the same descent, the
same state below?  Will you not, then, in every want
and necessity, look with confidence there, where even
the most rich and powerful, and kings and tyrants
themselves, must descend? You indeed may descend
hungry, perhaps, and they full of indigestion and
drunkenness. For have you often seen a beggar who
did not live to old age, nay, to extreme old age?</p>
<p rend="right">Chilled by day and night, lying on the ground, and
eating only what is barely necessary, they yet seem
almost to become incapable of dying.  But cannot
you write?  Cannot you keep a school? Cannot you
be a watchman at somebody's door?</p>
<p rend="right">"But it is shameful to come to this necessity."</p>
<p>First, therefore, learn what things are shameful, and
then claim to be a philosopher; but at present do
not suffer even another to call you so. Is that shameful to you which is not your own act; of which you
are not the cause; which has happened to you by
accident, like a fever or the headache? If your
parents were poor, or left others their heirs, or, though
living, do not assist you, are these things shameful for
you? Is this what you have learned from the philosophers? Have you never heard that what is shameful is blamable; and what is blamable must be
something which deserves to be blamed?  Whom do
you blame for an action not his own, which he has
not himself performed? Did you, then, make your
<pb id="p.2113"/>
father such as he is; or is it in your power to mend
him? Is that permitted you? What, then; must you
desire what is not permitted, and when you fail of it
be ashamed? Are you thus accustomed, even when
you are studying philosophy, to depend on others,
and to hope nothing from yourself?  Sigh, then, and
groan, and eat in fear that you shall have no food
to-morrow.  Tremble, lest your servants should rob
you, or run away from you, or die. Thus live on
forever, whoever you are, who have applied yourself
to philosophy in name only, and as much as in you
lies have disgraced its principles, by showing that
they are unprofitable and useless to those who profess
them. You have never made constancy, tranquillity,
and serenity the object of your desires; have sought
no teacher for this knowledge, but many for mere
syllogisms. You have never, by yourself, confronted
some delusive semblance with, " Can I bear this, or
can I not bear it?  What remains for me to do?"
But, as if all your affairs went safe and well, you have
aimed only-to secure yourself in your present possessions. What are they? Cowardice, baseness, worldliness, desires unaccomplished, unavailing aversions.
These are the things which you have been laboring
to secure. Ought you not first to have acquired
something by the use of reason, and then to have
provided security for that? Whom did you ever see
building a series of battlements without placing them
upon a wall? And what porter is ever set where
<pb id="p.2114"/>
there is no door? But <emph>you</emph> study! Can you show me
what you study?</p>
<p>" Not to be shaken by sophistry."</p>
<p>Shaken from what? Show me first what you have
in your custody; what you measure, or what you
weigh; and then accordingly show me your weights
and measures, and to what purpose you measure
that which is but dust. Ought you not to show what
makes men truly happy, what makes their affairs proceed as they wish; how we may blame no one,
accuse no one; how acquiesce in the administration
of the universe?  Show me these things. " See, I do
show them," say you; "I will solve syllogisms to
you." This is but the measure, O unfortunate ! and
not the thing measured. Hence you now pay the
penalty due for neglecting philosophy. You tremble;
you lie awake; you advise with everybody, and if the
result of the advice does not please everybody, you
think that you have been ill-advised.  Then you
dread hunger, as you fancy; yet it is not hunger that
you dread, but you are afraid that you will not have
some one to cook for you, some one else for a butler,
another to pull off your shoes, a fourth to dress you,
others to rub you, others to follow you; that when
you have undressed yourself in the bathing-room, and
stretched yourself out, like a man crucified, you may
be rubbed here and there; and the attendant may
stand by, and say, " Come this way; give your side;
take hold of his head; turn your shoulder;" and
<pb id="p.2115"/>
that when you are returned home from the bath you
may cry out, " Does nobody bring anything to eat? "
and then, "Take away; wipe the table."   This is
your dread, that you will not be able to lead the life
of a sick man. But learn the life of those in health,
-how slaves live, how laborers, how those who are
genuine philosophers; how Socrates lived, even with a
wife and children; how Diogenes; how Cleanthes, at
once studying and drawing water [for his livelihood].
If these are the things you would have, you can possess
them everywhere, and with a fearless confidence.</p>
<p>"In what?"</p>
<p>In the only thing that can be confided in; in what
is sure, incapable of being restrained or taken away,
- your own will.</p>
<p>But why have you contrived to make yourself so
useless and good for nothing that nobody will receive
you into his house, nobody take care of you; but
although, if any sound, useful vessel be thrown out
of doors, whoever finds it will take it up and prize it as
something gained, yet nobody will take <emph>you</emph> up, but
everybody esteem you a loss. What, cannot you so
much as perform the office of a dog or a cock?  Why,
then, do you wish to live any longer if you are so
worthless?  Does any good man fear that food should
fail him?  It does not fail the blind; it does not fail
the lame. Shall it fail a good man? A paymaster
is always to be found for a soldier, or a laborer, or a
shoemaker, and shall one be wanting to a good man?
<pb id="p.2116"/>
Is God so negligent of his own institutions, of his servants, of his witnesses, whom alone he uses for examples to the uninstructed, to show that he exists, and
that he administers the universe rightly, and doth not
neglect human affairs, and that no evil can happen
to a good man, either living or dead?  What, then,
is the case, when he doth not bestow food?  What
else than that, like a good general, he hath made me
a signal of retreat? I obey, I follow, speaking well
of my leader, praising his works. For I came when
it seemed good to him; and, again, when it seems
good to him, I depart; and in life it was my business
to praise God within myself and to every auditor, and
to the world.  Doth he grant me but few things?
Doth he refuse me affluence? It is not his pleasure
that I should live luxuriously; for he did not grant
that even to Hercules, his own son; but another
reigned over <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and Mycene, while he obeyed,
labored, and strove. And Eurystheus was just what
he was, - neither truly king of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, nor of Mycene;
not being indeed king over himself. But Hercules was
ruler and governor of the whole earth and seas; the
expeller of lawlessness and injustice; the introducer of
justice and sanctity. And this he effected naked and
alone. Again, when Ulysses was shipwrecked and
cast away, did his helpless condition at all deject him?
Did it break his spirit? No; but how did he go to
Nausicaa and her attendants, to ask those necessaries
which it seems most shameful to beg from another?

<div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<head>Of freedom.</head>
<p>He is free who lives as he likes; who is not subject to compulsion, to restraint, or to violence;
whose pursuits are unhindered, his desires successful,
his aversions unincurred. Who, then, would wish
to lead a wrong course of life? "No one."  Who
would live deceived, erring, unjust, dissolute, discontented, dejected? "No one." No wicked man, then,
lives as he likes; therefore no such man is free. And
who would live in sorrow, fear, envy, pity, with disappointed desires and unavailing aversions?  "No
one." Do we then find any of the wicked exempt
from these evils? "Not one."  Consequently, then,
they are not free.</p>
<p>If some person who has been twice consul should
hear this, he will forgive you, provided you add, "but
you are wise, and this has no reference to you." But
if you tell him the truth, that, in point of slavery, he
does not necessarily differ from those who have been
thrice sold, what but chastisement can you expect?
"For how," he says, "am I a slave?  My father was
<pb id="p.2120"/>
free, my mother free. Besides, I am a senator, too,
and the friend of Caesar, and have been twice consul,
and have myself many slaves."  In the first place,
most worthy sir, perhaps your father too was a slave
of the same kind; and your mother, and your grandfather, and all your series of ancestors. But even
were they ever so free, what is that to you? For
what if they were of a generous, you of a mean spirit;
they brave, and you a coward; they sober, and you
dissolute?</p>
<p>"But what," he says, "has this to do with my
being a slave?  " Is it no part of slavery to act against
your will, under compulsion, and lamenting? "Be it
so. But who can compel me but the master of all,
Caesar?"  By your own confession, then, you have
<emph>one</emph> master; and let not his being, as you say, master
of all, give you any comfort; for then you are merely
a slave in a large family. Thus the Nicopolitans,
too, frequently cry out, " By the genius of Caesar we
are <emph>free</emph> ! "</p>
<p>For the present, however, if you please, we will let
Caesar alone. But tell me this. Have you never
been in love with any one, either of a servile or liberal condition? "Why, what has that to do with
being slave or free?" Were you never commanded
anything by your mistress that you did not choose?
Have you never flattered your fair slave?  Have you
never kissed her feet? And yet if you were commanded to kiss Caesar's feet, you would think it an
<pb id="p.2121"/>
outrage and an excess of tyranny. What else is this
than slavery? Have you never gone out by night
where you did not desire? Have you never spent
more than you chose? Have you not sometimes
uttered your words with sighs and groans? Have
you never borne to be reviled and shut out of doors?
But if you are ashamed to confess your own follies,
see what Thrasonides<note anchored="yes">A character in one of the Comedies of Menander, called <emph>The Hated Lover</emph>. -C.</note>  says and does; who, after
having fought more battles perhaps than you, went
out by night, when [his slaves Geta would not dare
to go; nay, had he been compelled to do it, would
have gone bewailing and lamenting the bitterness of
servitude. And what says he afterwards? "A contemptible girl has enslaved <emph>me</emph>, whom no enemy ever
enslaved." Wretch ! to be the slave of a girl and a
contemptible girl too! Why, then, do you still call
yourself free?  Why do you boast your military expeditions?  Then he calls for a sword, and is angry with
the person who, out of kindness, denies it; and sends
presents to her who hates him; and begs, and weeps,
and then again is elated on every little success.
But what elation? Is he raised above desire or fear?</p>
<p>Consider what is our idea of freedom in animals.
Some keep tame lions, and feed them and even lead
them about; and who will say that any such lion is
free? Nay, does he not live the more slavishly the
more he lives at ease?  And who that had sense and
<pb id="p.2122"/>
reason would wish to be one of those lions? Again,
how much will caged birds suffer in trying to escape?
Nay, some of them starve themselves rather than
undergo such a life; others are saved only with difficulty and in a pining condition; and the moment
they find any opening, out they go. Such a desire
have they for their natural freedom, and to be at their
own disposal, and unrestrained.  "And what harm
can this confinement do you?"  "What say you?
I was born to fly where I please, to live in the open
air, to sing when I please. You deprive me of all
this, and then ask what harm I suffer?"</p>
<p>Hence we will allow those only to be free who will
not endure captivity, but, so soon as they are taken,
die and so escape. Thus Diogenes somewhere says
that the only way to freedom is to die with ease.
And he writes to the Persian king, "You can no more
enslave the Athenians than you can fish." "How?
Can I not get possession of them?"  "If you do,"
said he, " they will leave you, and be gone like fish.
For catch a fish, and it dies. And if the Athenians,
too, die as soon as you have caught them, of what use
are your warlike preparations? " This is the voice of
a free man who had examined the matter in earnest,
and, as it might be expected, found it all out. But
if you seek it where it is not, what wonder if you
never find it?</p>
<p>A slave wishes to be immediately set free. Think
you it is because he is desirous to pay his fee [of
<pb id="p.2123"/>
manumission] to the officer? No, but because he
fancies that, for want of acquiring his freedom, he has
hitherto lived under restraint and unprosperously.
"If I am once set free," he says, "it is all prosperity;
I care for no one; I can speak to all as being their
equal and on a level with them. I go where I will, I
come when and how I will." He is at last made free,
and presently having nowhere to eat he seeks whom
he may flatter, with whom he may sup. He then
either submits to the basest and most infamous degradation, and if he can obtain admission to some great
man's table, falls into a slavery much worse than the
former; or perhaps, if the ignorant fellow should grow
rich, he doats upon some girl, laments, and is unhappy, and wishes for slavery again.  " For what
harm did it do me? Another clothed me, another
shod me, another fed me, another took care of me
when I was sick. It was but in a few things, by way
of return, I used to serve him. But now, miserable
wretch ! what do I suffer, in being a slave to many,
instead of one ! Yet, if I can be promoted to equestrian rank, I shall live in the utmost prosperity and
happiness."  In order to obtain this, he first deservedly suffers; and as soon as he has obtained it, it
is all the same again. "But then," he says, "if I
do but get a military command, I shall be delivered
from all my troubles." He gets a military command.
He suffers as much as the vilest rogue of a slave; and,
nevertheless, he asks for a second command and a
<pb id="p.2124"/>
third; and when he has put the finishing touch, and
is made a senator, then he is a slave indeed. When
he comes into the public assembly, it is then that he
undergoes his finest and most splendid slavery.</p>
<p>[It is needful] not to be foolish, but to learn what
<placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> taught, the nature of things; and not rashly
to apply general principles to particulars. For the
cause of all human evils is the not being able to apply general principles to special cases. But different
people have different grounds of complaint; one, for
instance, that he is sick.  That is not the trouble;
it is in his principles.  Another, that he is poor;
another, that he has a harsh father and mother;
another, that he is not in the good graces of Caesar.
This is nothing else but not understanding how to
apply our principles. For who has not an idea of
evil, that it is hurtful; that it is to be avoided;
that it is by all means to be prudently guarded
against? One principle does not contradict another,
except when it comes to be applied. What, then, is
this evil, --thus hurtful and to be avoided?  "Not
to be the friend of Caesar," says some one. He is
gone; he has failed in applying his principles; he is
embarrassed; he seeks what is nothing to the purpose.
For if he comes to be Caesar's friend, he is still no
nearer to what he sought. For what is it that every
man seeks? To be secure, to be happy, to do what
he pleases without restraint and without compulsion.
When he becomes the friend of Caesar, then does he
<pb id="p.2125"/>
cease to be restrained; to be compelled? Is he
secure?  Is he happy? Whom shall we ask? Whom
can we better credit than this very man who has
been his friend?  Come forth and tell us whether
you sleep more quietly now than before you were
the friend of Caesar. You presently hear him cry,
"Leave off, for Heaven's sake! and do not insult
me. You know not the miseries I suffer; there is no
sleep for me; but one comes and says that Caesar
is already awake; another, that he is just going out.
Then follow perturbations, then cares."  Well, and
when did you use to sup the more pleasantly,-
formerly, or now? Hear what he says about this too.
When he is not invited, he is distracted; and if he is,
he sups like a slave with his master, solicitous all the
while not to say or do anything foolish. And what
think you?   Is he afraid of being whipped like a
slave? No such easy penalty. No; but rather, as
becomes so great a man, Caesar's friend, of losing his
head. And when did you bathe the more quietly;
when did you perform your exercises the more at
your leisure; in short, which life would you rather
wish to live, -your present, or the former?  I could
swear there is no one so stupid and insensible as
not to deplore his miseries, in proportion as he is
the more the friend of Caesar.</p>
<p>Since, then, neither they who are called kings nor
the friends of kings live as they like, who, then, after
all, is free? Seek, and you will find; for you are fur-
<pb id="p.2126"/>
nished by nature with means for discovering the truth.
But if you are not able by these alone to find the
consequence, hear them who have sought it. What
do they say? Do you think freedom a good? "The
greatest." Can any one, then, who attains the greatest good be unhappy or unsuccessful in his affairs?
" No." As many, therefore, as you see unhappy, lamenting, unprosperous, -confidently pronounce them
not free. " I do." Henceforth, then, we have done
with buying and selling, and such like stated conditions of becoming slaves. For if these concessions
hold, then, whether the unhappy man be a great or a
little king, - of consular or bi-consular dignity, - he
is not free. " Agreed."</p>
<p>Further, then, answer me this: do you think freedom to be something great and noble and valuable?
"How should I not? "  Is it possible, then, that he
who acquires anything so great and valuable and
noble should be of an abject spirit? "It is not."
Whenever, then, you see any one subject to another,
and flattering him contrary to his own opinion, confidently say that he too is not free; and not only when
he does this for a supper, but even if it be for a government, nay, a consulship. Call those indeed little
slaves who act thus for the sake of little things; and
call the others, as they deserve, great slaves. "Be
this, too, agreed." Well, do you think freedom
to be something independent and self-determined?
"How can it be otherwise?"  Him, then, whom it
<pb id="p.2127"/>
is in the power of another to restrain or to compel,
affirm confidently to be by no means free. And do
not heed his grandfathers or great-grandfathers, or
inquire whether he has been bought or sold; but if
you hear him say from his heart and with emotion,
"my master," though twelve Lictors should march
before him, call him a slave. And if you should hear
him say, "Wretch that I am! what do I suffer ! "
call him a slave. In short, if you see him wailing,
complaining, unprosperous, call him a slave, even in
purple.</p>
<p>"Suppose, then, that he does nothing of all this."
Do not yet say that he is free; but learn whether his
principles are in any event liable to compulsion, to
restraint, or disappointment; and if you find this to
be the case, call him a slave, keeping holiday during
the Saturnalia. Say that his master is abroad; that
he will come presently; and you will know what he
suffers. "Who will come? "  Whoever has the power
either of bestowing or of taking away any of the
things he desires.</p>
<p>"Have we so many masters, then?" We have.
For, prior to all such, we have the <emph>things</emph> themselves
for our masters. Now they are many; and it is
through these that the men who control the things
inevitably become our masters too. For no one fears
Caesar himself; but death, banishment, confiscation,
prison, disgrace. Nor does any one love Caesar unless
he be a person of great worth; but we love riches,
<pb id="p.2128"/>
the tribunate, the praetorship, the consulship. When
we love or hate or fear such things, they who have the
disposal of them must necessarily be our masters.
Hence we even worship them as gods. For we consider that whoever has the disposal of the greatest advantages is a deity; and then further reason falsely,
"But such a one has the control of the greatest advantages; therefore he is a deity." For if we reason
falsely, the final inference must be also false.</p>
<p>What is it, then, that makes a man free and independent?   For neither riches, nor consulship, nor
the command of provinces nor of kingdoms, can
make him so; but something else must be found.
What is it that keeps any one from being hindered
and restrained in penmanship, for instance?  " The
science of penmanship."  In music? "The science
of music."  Therefore in life too, it must be the science of living. As you have heard it in general, then,
consider it likewise in particulars. Is it possible for
him to be unrestrained who desires any of those
things that are within the power of others?  "No."
Can he avoid being hindered? "No." Therefore
neither can he be free. Consider, then, whether we
have nothing or everything in our own sole power, -
or whether some things are in our own power and
some in that of others. "What do you mean?"
When you would have your body perfect, is it in your
own power, or is it not? "It is not." When you
would be healthy?  "It is not."  When you would
<pb id="p.2129"/>
be handsome? "It is not."  When you would live
or die? "It is not."  Body then is not our own;
but is subject to everything that proves stronger than
itself.  "Agreed."  Well; is it in your own power
to have an estate when you please, and such a one
as you please?  "No."  Slaves? "No."  Clothes?
"No."   A house? "No."  Horses? " Indeed, none
of these." Well, if you desire ever so earnestly to
have your children live, or your wife, or your brother,
or your friends, is it in your own power?  " No, it is
not."</p>
<p>Will you then say that there is <emph>nothing</emph> independent,
which is in your own power alone, and unalienable?
See if you have anything of this sort. "I do not
know."   But consider it thus: can any one make
you assent to a falsehood?  " No one." In the matter of assent, then, you are unrestrained and unhindered. "Agreed."  Well, and can any one compel
you to exert your aims towards what you do not like?
"He can. For when he threatens me with death, or
fetters, he thus compels me." If, then, you were to
despise dying or being fettered, would you any longer
regard him? "No." Is despising death, then, an
action in our power, or is it not? "It is." Is it
therefore in your power also to exert your aims
towards anything, or is it not?  "Agreed that it is.
But in whose power is my avoiding anything? " This,
too, is in your own. "What then if, when I am exerting myself to walk, any one should restrain me?
<pb id="p.2130"/>
What part of you can he restrain? Can he restrain
your assent? " No, but my body." Ay, as he may
a stone. "Be it so. But still I cease to walk." And
who claimed that walking was one of the actions that
cannot be restrained?  For I only said that your
exerting yourself towards it could not be restrained.
But wherever the body and its assistance are essential,
you have already heard that nothing is in your power.
"Be this, too, agreed."  And can any one compel
you to desire against your Will?  "No one."  Or to
propose, or intend, or, in short, not to be beguiled by
the appearances of things? "Nor this. But when I
desire anything, he can restrain me from obtaining
what I desire." If you desire anything that is truly
within your reach, and that cannot be restrained, how
can he restrain you?  "By no means."  And pray
who claims that he who longs for what depends on
another will be free from restraint?</p>
<p>"May I not long for health, then? "  By no means;
nor for anything else that depends on another; for
what is not in your own power, either to procure or
to preserve when you will, <emph>that</emph> belongs to another.
Keep off not only your hands from it, but even more
than these, your desires. Otherwise you have given
yourself up as a slave; you have put your neck under
the yoke, if you admire any of the things which are
not your own, but which are subject and mortal, to
which of them soever you are attached. " Is not my
hand my own?" It is a part of you, but it is by
<pb id="p.2131"/>
nature clay, liable to restraint, to compulsion; a slave
to everything stronger than itself. And why do I say,
your hand? You ought to hold your whole body but
as a useful ass, with a pack-saddle on, so long as may
be, so long as it is allowed you. But if there should
come a military conscription, and a soldier should lay
hold on it, let it go.  Do not resist, or murmur;
otherwise you will be first beaten and lose the ass
after all. And since you are thus to regard even the
body itself, think what remains to do concerning
things to be provided for the sake of the body. If
that be an ass, the rest are but bridles, pack-saddles,
shoes, oats, hay for him. Let these go too. Quit
them yet more easily and expeditiously. And when
you are thus prepared and trained to distinguish what
belongs to others from your own; what is liable to
restraint from what is not; to esteem the one your
own property, but not the other; to keep your desire,
to keep your aversion, carefully regulated by this point,
-whom have you any longer to fear?   " No one."
For about what should you be afraid, - about what is
your own, in which consists the essence of good and
evil? And who has any power over <emph>this</emph>?  Who can
take it away? Who can hinder you, any more than
God can be hindered? But are you afraid for body,
for possessions, for what belongs to others, for what is
nothing to you? And what have you been studying
all this while, but to distinguish between your own
and that which is not your own; what is in your
<pb id="p.2132"/>
power and what is not in your power; what is liable
to restraint and what is not? And for what purpose
have you applied to the philosophers, - that you
might nevertheless be disappointed and unfortunate?
No doubt you will be exempt from fear and perturbation! And what is grief to you?  For whatsoever
we anticipate with fear, we endure with grief. And
for what will you any longer passionately wish? For
you have acquired a temperate and steady desire of
things dependent on will, since they are accessible
and desirable; and you have no desire of things uncontrollable by will. so as to leave room for that
irrational, and impetuous, and precipitate passion.</p>
<p>Since then you are thus affected with regard to
<emph>things</emph>, what man can any longer be formidable to
you?   What has man that he can be formidable
to man, either in appearance, or speech, or mutual
intercourse? No more than horse to horse, or dog
to dog, or bee to bee. But <emph>things</emph> are formidable to
every one, and whenever any person can either give
these to another, or take them away, he becomes formidable too. "How, then, is this citadel to be destroyed?" Not by sword or fire, but by principle.
For if we should demolish the visible citadel, shall
we have demolished also that of some fever, of some
fair woman,-in short, the citadel [of temptation]
within ourselves; and have turned out the tyrants
to whom we are subject upon all occasions and every
day, sometimes the same, sometimes others? From
<pb id="p.2133"/>
hence we must begin; hence demolish the citadel,
and turn out the tyrants, -give up body, members,
riches, power, fame, magistracies, honors, children,
brothers, friends; esteem all these as belonging to
others. And if the tyrants be turned out from hence,
why should I also demolish the external citadel, at
least on my own account? For what harm to <emph>me</emph>
from its standing? Why should I turn out the guards?
For in what point do they affect me? It is against
others that they direct their fasces, their staves, and
their swords. Have I ever been restrained from what
I willed, or compelled against my will? Indeed, how
is this possible? I have placed my pursuits under
the direction of God.  Is it his will that I should
have a fever? It is my will too. Is it his will that
I should pursue anything?  It is my will too. Is it
his will that I should desire?  It is my will too. Is
it his will that I should obtain anything? It is mine
too. Is it not his will? It is not mine. Is it his will
that I should be tortured? Then it is my will to be
tortured. Is it his will that I should die?  Then it is
my will to die. Who can any longer restrain or compel
me, contrary to my own opinion?  No more than Zeus.</p>
<p>It is thus that cautious travellers act. Does some
one hear that the road is beset by robbers? He does
not set out alone, but waits for the retinue of an
ambassador or quaestor or proconsul, and when he
has joined himself to their company, goes along in
safety. Thus does the prudent man act in the world.
<pb id="p.2134"/>
There are many robberies, tyrants, storms, distresses,
losses of things most dear. Where is there any refuge?
How can he go alone unattacked? What retinue can
he wait for, to go safely through his journey? To
what company shall he join himself, -to some rich
man; to some consular senator? And what good
will that do me?  He may be robbed himself, groaning and lamenting. And what if my fellow-traveller
himself should turn against me and rob me?  What
shall I do? I say I will be the friend of Caesar.
While I am his companion, no one will injure me,
Yet before I can become illustrious enough for this,
what must I bear and suffer ! How often, and by how
many, must I be robbed ! And then, if I do become
the friend of Caesar, he too is mortal; and if, by any
accident, he should become my enemy, where can I
best retreat, -to a desert?  Well, and may not a
fever come there?  What can be done, then?  Is it
not possible to find a fellow-traveller safe, faithful,
brave, incapable of being surprised? A person who
reasons thus, understands and considers that if he
joins himself to God, he shall go safely through his
journey.</p>
<p>"How do you mean, join himself?  " That whatever
is the will of God may be <emph>his</emph> will too; that whatever
is not the will of God may not be his. "How, then,
can this be done?"  Why, how otherwise than by
considering the workings of God's power and his administration? What has he given me to be my own,
<pb id="p.2135"/>
and independent? What has he reserved to himself?
He has given me whatever depends on will. The
things within my power he has made incapable of hindrance or restraint. Bat how could he make a body
of clay incapable of hindrance? Therefore he has
subjected possessions, furniture, house, children, wife,
to the revolutions of the universe.  Why, then, do
I fight against God? Why do I will to retain that
which depends not on will; that which is not
granted absolutely, but how, - in such a manner and
for such a time as was thought proper? But he who
gave takes away. Why, then, do I resist? Besides
being a fool, in contending with a stronger than my
self, I shall be unjust, which is a more important consideration. For whence had I these things, when I
came into the world? My father gave them to me.
And who gave them to him? And who made the
sun; who the fruits; who the seasons; who their
connection and relations with each other? And after
you have received all, and even your very self, from
another, are you angry with the giver, and do you
complain, if he takes anything away from you?  Who
are you; and for what purpose did you come? Was
it not he who brought you here?  Was it not he
who showed you the light? Hath not he given you
companions? Hath not he given you senses? Hath
not he given you reason? And as whom did he
bring you here?  Was it not as a mortal?  Was it not
as one to live with a little portion of flesh upon earth,
<pb id="p.2136"/>
and to see his administration; to behold the spectacle
with him, and partake of the festival for a short time?
After having beheld the spectacle and the solemnity,
then, as long as it is permitted you, will you not depart
when he leads you out, adoring and thankful for what
you have heard and seen? "No; but I would enjoy
the feast still longer." So would the initiated [in the
mysteries], too, be longer in their initiation; so, perhaps, would the spectators at <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName> see more
combatants. But the solemnity is over. Go away.
Depart like a grateful and modest person; make room
for others. Others, too, must be born as you were;
and when they are born must have a place, and habitations, and necessaries. But if the first do not give
way, what room is there left? Why are you insatiable,
unconscionable?  Why do you crowd the world?</p>
<p>" Ay, but I would have my wife and children with
me too."  Why, are they <emph>yours</emph>?  Are they not the
Giver's?  Are they not his who made <emph>you</emph> also? Will
you not then quit what belongs to another? Will you
not yield to your Superior?  "Why, then, did he
bring me into the world upon these conditions?"
Well, if it is not worth your while, depart. He has
no need of a discontented spectator. He wants such
as will share the festival; make part of the chorus;
who will extol, applaud, celebrate the solemnity. He
will not be displeased to see the wretched and fearful dismissed from it. For when they were present
they did not behave as at a festival, nor fill a proper
<pb id="p.2137"/>
place, but lamented, found fault with the Deity, with
their fortune, with their companions.  They were
insensible both of their advantages and of the powers
which they received for far different purposes, - the
powers of magnanimity, nobleness of spirit, fortitude,
and that which now concerns us, freedom.  "For
what purpose, then, have I received these things?"
To use them. "How long?"  As long as he who
lent them pleases. If, then, they are not necessary,
do not make an idol of them, and they will not be
so; do not tell yourself that they are necessary, when
they are not.</p>
<p>This should be our study from morning till night
beginning with the least and frailest things, as with
earthenware, with glassware. Afterwards proceed to
a suit of clothes, a dog, a horse, an estate; thence
to yourself, body, members, children, wife, brothers.
Look everywhere around you, and be able to detach
yourself from these things. Correct your principles.
Permit nothing to cleave to you that is not your own;
nothing to grow to you that may give you agony
when it is torn away. And say, when you are daily
training yourself as you do here, not that you act the
philosopher, which may be a presumptuous claim, but
that you are asserting your freedom. For this is true
freedom. This is the freedom that Diogenes gained
from Antisthenes, and declared it was impossible
that he should ever after be a slave to any one.
Hence, when he was taken prisoner, how did he treat
<pb id="p.2138"/>
the pirates?  Did he call any of them master?  I do
not mean the name, for I am not afraid of a word,
but of the disposition from whence the word proceeds.
How did he reprove them for feeding their prisoners
ill? How was he sold? Did he seek a master? No,
but a slave. And when he was sold, how did he converse with his lord? He immediately disputed with
him whether he ought to be dressed or shaved in the
manner he was; and how he ought to bring up his
children.  And where is the wonder?  For if the
same master had bought some one to instruct his
children in gymnastic exercises, would he in those
exercises have treated him as a servant or as a
master? And so if he had bought a physician or
an architect. In every department the skilful must
necessarily be superior to the unskilful. What else,
then, can he be but master, who possesses the universal knowledge of life? For who is master in a
ship? The pilot. Why? Because whoever disobeys
him is a loser.   "But a master can put me in
chains." Can he do it, then, without being a loser?
"I think not, indeed."  But because he must be a
loser, he evidently must not do it; for no one acts
unjustly without being a loser. "And how does he
suffer, who puts his own slave in chains?" What
think you? From the very fact of chaining him.
This you yourself must grant, if you would hold to
the doctrine that man is not naturally a wild, but a
gentle, animal. For when is it that a vine is in a bad
<pb id="p.2139"/>
condition? "When it is in a condition contrary to
its nature." How is it with a cock? "The same."
It is therefore the same with a man also. What is
his nature, -to bite and kick and throw into prison
and cut off heads? No, but to do good, to assist, to
indulge the wishes of others. Whether you will or
not, then, he is in a bad condition whenever he acts
unreasonably. "And so was not <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> in a bad
condition? " No, but his judges and accusers. " Nor
Helvidius, at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>? " No, but his murderer. " How
do you talk?" Why, just as you do. You do not
call that cock in a bad condition which is victorious,
and yet wounded; but that which is conquered and
comes off unhurt. Nor do you call a dog happy
which neither hunts nor toils; but when you see him
perspiring, and distressed, and panting with the chase.
In what do we talk paradoxes? If we say that the
evil of everything consists in what is contrary to its
nature, is this a paradox? Do you not say it with
regard to other things? Why, therefore, in the case
of man alone, do you take a different view? But
further, it is no paradox to say that by nature man
is gentle and social and faithful. "This is none."
How then [is it a paradox to say] that, when he is
whipped, or imprisoned, or beheaded, he is not hurt?
If he suffers nobly, does he not come off even the
better and a gainer? But he is the person hurt who
suffers the most miserable and shameful evils; who, instead of a man, becomes a wolf, a viper, or a hornet.
<pb id="p.2140"/></p>
<p>Come, then; let us recapitulate what has been
granted. The man who is unrestrained, who has all
things in his power as he wills, is free; but he who
may be restrained or compelled or hindered, or
thrown into any condition against his will, is a slave.
"And who is unrestrained? "  He who desires none
of those things that belong to others. "And what
are those things which belong to others?"  Those
which are not in our own power, either to have or
not to have; or to have them thus or so. Body,
therefore, belongs to another; its parts to another;
property to another. If, then, you attach yourself to
any of these as your own, you will be punished as he
deserves who desires what belongs to others. This
is the way that leads to freedom, this the only
deliverance from slavery, to be able at length to say,
from the bottom of one's soul,-
<cit><quote><l>Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,</l>
<l>Wherever your decrees have fixed my lot.</l></quote> <bibl>A Fragment of Cleanthes, before quoted; and given in full in Enchiridion, c. 52.</bibl></cit>-H.</p>
<p>But what say you, philosopher? A tyrant calls
upon you to speak something unbecoming you. Will
you say it, or will you not? "Stay, let me consider." Would you consider <emph>now</emph>?  And what did
you use to consider when you were in the schools?
Did you not study what things were good and evil,
and what indifferent?  "I did."  Well, and what
<pb id="p.2141"/>
were the opinions which pleased us? "That just
and fair actions were good; unjust and base ones,
evil."  Is living a good?  "No."  Dying, an evil?
"No."   A prison?  "No."   And what did a mean
and dishonest speech, the betraying a friend, or the
flattering a tyrant, appear to us?  "Evils."  Why,
then, are you still considering, and have not already
considered and come to a resolution? For what sort
of a consideration is this: "Whether I ought, when
it is in my power, to procure myself the greatest good,
instead of procuring myself the greatest evil." A
fine and necessary consideration, truly, and deserving mighty deliberation ! Why do you trifle with us,
man? No one ever needed to consider any such
point; nor, if you really imagined things fair and
honest to be good, things base and dishonest to be
evil, and all other things indifferent, would you ever
be in such a perplexity as this, or near it; but you
would presently be able to distinguish by your understanding as you do by your sight. For do you ever
have to consider whether black is white, or whether
light is heavy? Do you not follow the plain evidence
of your senses? Why, then, do you say that you are
now considering whether things indifferent are to be
avoided, rather than evils? The truth is, you have
no principles; for things indifferent do not impress
you as such, but as the greatest evils; and these last,
on the other hand, as things of no importance.</p>
<p>For thus has been your practice from the first.
<pb id="p.2142"/>
"Where am I? If I am in the school and there is
an audience, I talk as the philosophers do; but if I
am out of the school, then away with this stuff that
belongs only to scholars and fools." This man is
accused by the testimony of a philosopher, his friend;
this philosopher turns parasite; another hires himself
out for money; a third does that in the very senate.
When one is not governed by appearances, then his
principles speak for themselves. You are a poor cold
lump of prejudice, consisting of mere phrases, on
which you hang as by a hair. You should preserve
yourself firm and practical, remembering that you
are to deal with real things. In what manner do
you hear, - I will not say that your child is dead, for
how could you possibly bear that?- but that your
oil is spilled, your wine consumed?  Would that
some one, while you are bawling, would only say this:
"Philosopher, you talk quite otherwise when in the
schools. Why do you deceive us? Why, when you
are a worm, do you call yourself a man?  " I should
be glad to be near one of these philosophers while
he is revelling in debauchery, that I might see how
he demeans himself, and what sayings he utters;
whether he remembers the title he bears and the
discourses which he hears, or speaks, or reads.</p>
<p>" And what is all this to freedom?"  It lies in
nothing else than this, - whether you rich people approve or not. "And who affords evidence of this? "
Who but yourselves?   You who have a powerful
<pb id="p.2143"/>
master, and live by his motion and nod, and faint
away if he does but look sternly upon you, who pay
your court to old men and old women, and say, " I
cannot do this or that, it is not in my power." Why
is it not in your power? Did you not just now contradict me, and say you were free? " But Aprylla has
forbidden me." Speak the truth, then, slave, and do
not run away from your masters nor deny them, nor
dare to assert your freedom, when you have so many
proofs of your slavery. One might indeed find some
excuse for a person compelled by love to do something contrary to his opinion, even when at the same
time he sees what is best without having resolution
enough to follow it, since he is withheld by something
overpowering, and in some measure divine. But who
can bear with you, who are in love with old men and
old women, and perform menial offices for them,
and bribe them with presents, and wait upon them
like a slave when they are sick; at the same time
wishing they may die, and inquiring of the physician
whether their distemper be yet mortal? And again,
when for these great and venerable magistracies and
honors you kiss the hands of the slaves of others; so
that you are the slave of those who are not free themselves ! And then you walk about in state, a praetor
or a consul. Do I not know how you came to be
praetor; whence you received the consulship; who
gave it to you? For my own part, I would not even
live, if I must live by Felicio's means, and bear his
<pb id="p.2144"/>
pride and slavish insolence. For I know what a
slave is, blinded by what he thinks good fortune.</p>
<p>" Are you free yourself, then? " you may ask. By
Heaven, I wish and pray for it. But I own I cannot
yet face my masters. I still pay a regard to my body,
and set a great value on keeping it whole; though,
for that matter, it is not whole. But I can show
you one who was free, that you may no longer seek
an example. Diogenes was free. " How so?"  Not
because he was of free parents, for he was not; but
because he was so in himself; because he had cast
away all which gives a handle to slavery; nor was
there any way of getting at him, nor anywhere to lay
hold on him, to enslave him. Everything sat loose
upon him; everything only just hung on. If you took
hold on his possessions, he would rather let them
go than follow you for them; if on his leg, he let go
his leg; if his body, he let go his body; acquaintance, friends, country, just the same. For he knew
whence he had them, and from whom, and upon what
conditions he received them. But he would never
have forsaken his true parents, the gods, and his real
country [the universe]; nor have suffered any one to
be more dutiful and obedient to them than he; nor
would any one have died more readily for his country
than he. He never had to inquire whether he should
act for the good of the whole universe; for he remembered that everything that exists belongs to
that administration, and is commanded by its ruler.
<pb id="p.2145"/>
Accordingly, see what he himself says and writes.
"Upon this account," said he, "O Diogenes, it is
in your power to converse as you will with the Persian
monarch and with Archidamus, king of the Lacedemonians." Was it because <emph>he</emph> was born of free parents?
Or was it because <emph>they</emph> were descended from slaves,
that all the Athenians, and all the Lacedemonians, and
Corinthians, could not converse with them as they
pleased; but feared and paid court to them? Why
then is it in your power, Diogenes?  "Because I do
not esteem this poor body as my own. Because I
want nothing. Because this and nothing else is a
law to me." These were the things that enabled him
to be free.</p>
<p>And that you may not urge that I show you the
example of a man clear of incumbrances, without a
wife or children or country or friends or relations, to
bend and draw him aside, take <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, and consider him, who had a wife and children, but held them
not as his own; had a country, friends, relations, but
held them only so long as it was proper, and in the
manner that was proper; submitting all these to the
law and to the obedience due to it. Hence, when it
was proper to fight, he was the first to go out, and
exposed himself to danger without the least reserve.
But when he was sent by the thirty tyrants to apprehend <placeName key="tgn,1018742">Leon</placeName>,<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, with four other persons, was commanded by the

in order to be put to death. His companions executed their
commission; but <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> remained at home, and chose rather
to expose his life to the fury of the tyrants, than be accessory to
the death of an innocent person. He would most probably
have fallen a sacrifice to their vengeance, if the Oligarchy had
not shortly after been dissolved. See <bibl>Plato's <title>Apology</title>.</bibl> - C.</note> because he esteemed it a base action, he
<pb id="p.2146"/>
did not even deliberate about it; though he knew that,
perhaps, he might die for it. But what did that
signify to him? For it was something else that he
wanted to preserve, not his mere flesh; but his fidelity,
his honor, free from attack or subjection. And afterwards, when he was to make a defence for his life,
does he behave like one having children, or a wife?
No, but like a single man. And how does he behave,
when required to drink the poison?  When he might
escape, and Crito would have him escape from prison
for the sake of his children, what says he? Does he
esteem it a fortunate opportunity?  How should he?
But he considers what is becoming, and neither sees
nor regards anything else. " For I am not desirous,"
he says, " to preserve this pitiful body; but that part
which is improved and preserved by justice, and impaired and destroyed by injustice."  <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> is not to
be basely preserved. He who refused to vote for what
the Athenians commanded; he who contemned the
thirty tyrants; he who held such discourses on virtue
and moral beauty, - such a man is not to be preserved
by a base action, but is preserved by dying, instead of
running away. For even a good actor is preserved as
such by leaving off when he ought; not by going on
<pb id="p.2147"/>
to act beyond his time. " What then will become of
your children? "  <cit><quote>If I had gone away into <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>,
you would have taken care of them; and will there be
no one to take care of them when I am departed to
Hades?</quote> <bibl n="Plat. Crito 54a">Plato, Crito, i. 5.</bibl></cit> You see how he ridicules and plays with
death. But if it had been you or I, we should presently have proved by philosophical arguments that
those who act unjustly are to be repaid in their own
way; and should have added, "If I escape I shall
be of use to many; if I die, to none."  Nay, if it
had been necessary, we should have crept through a
mouse-hole to get away. But how should <emph>we</emph> have
been of use to any? Where must they have dwelt?
If we were useful alive, should we not be of still more
use to mankind by dying when we ought and as we
ought? And now the remembrance of the death of
<placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> is not less, but even more useful to the world
than that of the things which he did and said when
alive.</p>
<p>Study these points, these principles, these discourses; contemplate these examples if you would
be free, if you desire the thing in proportion to its
value. And where is the wonder that you should
purchase so good a thing at the price of other things,
be they never so many and so great? Some hang
themselves, others break their necks, and sometimes
even whole cities have been destroyed for that which
is reputed freedom; and will not you for the sake of
<pb id="p.2148"/>
the true and secure and inviolable freedom, repay
God what he hath given when he demands it?  Will
you not study not only, as Plato says, how to die, but
how to be tortured and banished and scourged; and,
in short, how to give up all that belongs to others?
If not, you will be a slave among slaves, though you
were ten thousand times a consul; and even though
you should rise to the palace, you will never be the
less so. And you will feel that, though philosophers
(as Cleanthes says) do, perhaps, talk contrary to
common opinion, yet it is not contrary to reason.
For you will find it true, in fact, that the things that
are eagerly followed and admired are of no use to
those who have gained them; while they who have not
yet gained them imagine that, if they are acquired,
every good will come along with them; and then,
when they are acquired, there is the same feverishness, the same agitation, the same nausea, and the
same desire for what is absent. For freedom is not
procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired, but
by controlling the desire. And in order to know that
this is true, take the same pains about these which
you have taken about other things. Hold vigils to
acquire a set of principles that will make you free.
Instead of a rich old man, pay your court to a philosopher. Be seen about his doors. You will not get any
disgrace by being seen there. You will not return
empty or unprofited if you go as you ought. However, try at least. The trial is not dishonorable.

<head>Of complaisance.</head>
<p>To this point you must attend before all others:
not to be so attached to any one of your former
acquaintances or friends as to condescend to behavior
like his; otherwise you will undo yourself. But if it
comes into your head, "I shall appear odd to him,
and he will not treat me as before," remember that
there is nothing to be had for nothing; nor is it possible that he who acts in the same manner as before
should not remain the same person. Choose, then,
whether you will be loved by those who formerly loved
you, and be like your former self; or be better, and
not meet with the same treatment. For if this last is
preferable, immediately incline altogether this way,
and let no other kind of reasoning draw you aside;
for no one can improve while he is wavering. If,
then, you prefer this to everything, if you would be
fixed only on this, and employ all your pains about it,
give up everything else. Otherwise this wavering will
affect you in both directions; you will neither make a
due improvement, nor preserve the advantages you had
before. For before, by setting your heart entirely on
things of no value, you were agreeable to your companions. But you cannot excel in both styles; you
<pb id="p.2150"/>
must necessarily lose as much of the one as you partake of the other. If you do not drink with those
with whom you used to drink, you cannot appear
equally agreeable to them. Choose, then, whether
you would be. a drunkard, and agreeable to them, or
sober, and disagreeable to them. If you do not sing
with those with whom you used to sing, you cannot be
equally dear to them. Here too, then, choose which
you will. For if it is better to be modest and decent
than to have it said of you "what an agreeable fellow," give up the rest; renounce it; withdraw yourself; have nothing to do with it. But if this does not
please you, incline with your whole force the contrary
way. Be one of the debauchees; one of the adulterers.
Act all that is consistent with such a character, and
you will obtain what you would have. Jump up in the
theatre, too, and roar out in praise of the dancer.
But characters so different are not to be confounded
You cannot act both Thersites and Agamemnon. If
you would be Thersites, you must be hump-backed
and bald; if Agamemnon, great and noble, and faithful to those who are under your care

<head>What things are to be exchanged for others.</head>
<p>When  you have lost anything external, have
always at hand the consideration of what you
have got instead of it; and if this be of more value,
do not by any means call yourself a loser, - whether it
be a horse for an ass; an ox for a sheep; a good action for a piece of money; a due composure of mind
for a dull jest; or modesty for indecent talk. By continually remembering this, you will preserve your
character such as it ought to be. Otherwise, consider
that you are spending your time in vain; and all that
to which you are now applying your mind, you are
about to spill and overturn. And there needs but
little, merely a small deviation from reason, to destroy
and overset all. A pilot does not need so much apparatus to overturn a ship as to save it; but if he exposes it a little too much to the wind, it is lost; even
if he should not do it by design, but only for a moment be thinking of something else, it is lost. Such
is the case here too. If you do but nod a little, all
that you have hitherto accomplished is gone. Take
heed, then, to the appearances of things. Keep yourself watchful over them. It is no inconsiderable
matter that you have to guard; but modesty, fidelity,
<pb id="p.2152"/>
constancy, docility, innocence, fearlessness, serenity,
-in short, freedom. For what will you sell these?
Consider what the purchase is worth. " But shall I
not get such a thing instead of it? " Consider, if you
do not get it, what it is that you have instead. Suppose I have decency, and another the office of tribune;
I have modesty, and he the praetorship? But I do not
applaud where it is unbecoming; I will pay no undeserved honor; for I am free, and the friend of God,
so as to obey him willingly; and I must not value
anything else, neither body, nor possessions, nor fame,
- in short, nothing. For it is not his will that I should
value them. If this had been his pleasure, he would
have placed in them my good, which now he has not
done; therefore I cannot transgress his commands.
Seek in all things your own highest good; and for
other aims, recognize them so far as the case requires,
and in accordance with reason, contented with this
alone.  Otherwise you will be unfortunate, disappointed, restrained, hindered. These are the established laws, these the statutes. Of these one ought to
be an expositor, and to these obedient, rather than to
those of Masurius and Cassius.<note anchored="yes">Two famous lawyers. - C.</note>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Concerning those who earnestly desire a life of repose.</head>
<p>Remember that it is not only the desire of riches
and power that debases us and subjects us to
others, but even that of quiet, leisure, learning, or
travelling. For, in general, reverence for any external
thing whatever makes us subject to others. Where is
the difference, then, whether you desire to be a senator or not to be a senator? Where is the difference,
whether you desire power or to be out of power?
Where is the difference, whether you say, " I am in a
wretched way, I have nothing to do; but am tied
down to books, as inactive as if I were dead;" or
" I am in a wretched way, I have no leisure to read "?
For as levees and power are among things external
and uncontrollable by will, so likewise is a book.
For what purpose would you read? Tell me. For if
you rest merely in being amused and learning something, you are insignificant and miserable. But if
you refer it to the proper end, what is that end but
a life truly prosperous? And if reading does not procure you a prosperous life, of what use is it? " But it
does procure a prosperous life (say you) ; and therefore I am .uneasy at being deprived of it." And
what sort of prosperity is that which everything can
<pb id="p.2154"/>
hinder, - I do not say Caesar alone, or Caesar's friend,
but a crow, a man practising the flute, a fever, or ten
thousand other things? Nothing is so essential to
prosperity as that it should be permanent and unhindered. Suppose I am now called to do something. I
go, therefore, and will be attentive to the bounds and
measures which ought to be observed; that I may act
modestly, steadily, and without desire or aversion as
to externals. In the next place, I am attentive to
other men, what they say, and how they are moved;
and that not from ill-nature, nor that I may have an
opportunity for censure or ridicule; but I turn to myself. " Am I also guilty of the same faults; and how
then shall I leave them off?  " or, " I once thus erred,
but, God be thanked, not now." Well, when you have
done thus, and been employed on such things, have
you not done as good a work as if you had read a
thousand lines or written as many? For are you uneasy at not reading while you are eating? When you
eat, or bathe, or exercise, are you not satisfied with
doing it in a manner corresponding to what you have
read? Why, then, do you not reason in like manner
about everything? When you approach Caesar or any
other person, if you preserve yourself dispassionate,
fearless, sedate; if you are rather an observer of what
is done than the subject of observation; if you do not
envy those who are preferred to you; if you are not
overcome by the occasion, what need you more?
Books?  How, or to what end?  For these are not
<pb id="p.2155"/>
the real preparation for living, but living is made up
of things very different. Just as if a champion, when
he enters the lists, should begin crying because he is
not still exercising in advance. It was for this that
you were exercised. For this were the dumb-bells,
the dust, and your young antagonists. And do you
now seek for these when it is the time for actual business?  This is just as if, in forming our opinions, when
perplexed between true and false semblances, we
should, instead of practically distinguishing between
them, merely peruse dissertations on evidence.</p>
<p>What, then, is the trouble? That we have neither
learned by reading, nor by writing, how to deal practically with the semblances of things according to the
laws of nature. But we stop at learning what is said,
and, being able to explain it to others, at solving syllogisms and arranging hypothetical arguments. Hence
where the study is, there, too, is the hindrance. Do
you desire absolutely what is out of your power? Be
restrained then, be hindered, be disappointed. But if
we were to read dissertations about the exertion of our
efforts, not merely to see what might be said about our
efforts, but to exert them well; on desire and aversion, that we might not be disappointed of our desires,
nor incur our aversions; on the duties of life, that
mindful of our relations, we might do nothing irrational nor inconsistent with them; then we should not
be provoked at being hindered in our reading; but
should be contented with the performance of actions
<pb id="p.2156"/>
suitable to us, and should learn a new standard of
computation. Not, "To-day I have perused so many
lines; I have written so many; " but, "To-day I have
used my efforts as the philosophers direct. I have
restrained my desire. absolutely; I have applied my
aversion only to things controllable by will. I have
not been terrified by such a one, nor put out of countenance by such another. I have exercised my patience, my abstinence, my beneficence." And thus
we should thank God for what we ought to thank him.</p>
<p>But now we resemble the crowd in another way
also, and do not know it. One is afraid that he shall
not be in power; you, that you shall. By no means
be afraid of it, man; but as you laugh at him, laugh
at yourself. For there is no difference, whether you
thirst like one in a fever, or dread water like him who
is bit by a mad dog. Else how can you say, like
<placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, "If it so pleases God, so let it be"?  Do
you think that <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, if he had fixed his desires on
the leisure of the lyceum or the academy, or the conversation of the youth there, day after day, would
have made so many campaigns as he did, so readily?
Would not he have lamented and groaned: "How
wretched am I ! now must I be miserable here, when
I might be sunning myself in the lyceum "?  Was
that your business in life, then, to sun yourself?  Was
it not to be truly successful; to be unrestrained and
free?  And how could he have been <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, if he
had lamented thus? How could he after that have
written Paeans in a prison?
<pb id="p.2157"/></p>
<p>In short, then, remember this, that so far as you
prize anything external to your own will, you impair
that will. And not only power is external to it, but
the being out of power too; not only business, but
leisure too. "Then must I live in this tumult now? "
What do you call a tumult? "A multitude of people." And where is the hardship? Suppose it to be
the Olympic Games. Think it a public assembly.
There, too, some bawl out one thing, some another;
some push the rest. The baths are crowded. Yet
who of us is not pleased with these assemblies, and
does not grieve to leave them? Do not be hard to
please, and squeamish at what happens. "Vinegar is
disagreeable, for it is sour. Honey is disagreeable,
for it disorders my constitution. I do not like vegetables."  "So I do not like retirement, it is a desert;
I do not like a crowd, it is a tumult." Why, if things
are so disposed that you are to live atone or with
few, call this condition repose, and make use of it as
you ought. Talk with yourself, judge of the appearances presented to your mind; train your mental
habits to accuracy. But if you happen on a crowd,
call it one of the public games, a grand assembly, a
festival. Endeavor to share in the festival with the
rest of the world. For what sight is more pleasant to
a lover of mankind than a great number of men?
We see companies of oxen or horses with pleasure.
We are highly delighted to see a great many ships.
Who is sorry to see a great many men? "But they
<pb id="p.2158"/>
stun me with their noise." Then your hearing is
hindered; and what is that to you?  Is your faculty of
making a right use of the appearances of things
hindered too? Or who can restrain you from using
your desire and aversion, your powers of pursuit and
avoidance, conformably to nature? What tumult is
sufficient for this?</p>
<p>Do but remember the general rules. What is
mine; what not mine? What is allotted   me?
What is it the will of God that I should do now?
What is not his will? A little while ago it was his
will that you should be at leisure, should talk with
yourself, write about these things, read, hear, prepare
yourself. You have had sufficient time for this. At
present he says to you, "Come now to the combat.
Show us what you have learned; how you have
wrestled." How long would you exercise by yourself?
It is now the time to show whether you are of the
Lumber of those champions who merit victory, or of
those who go about the world conquered in all the
circle of games. Why, then, are you out of humor?
There is no combat without a tumult. There must
be many preparatory exercises, many acclamations,
many masters, many spectators. "But I would live
in quiet." Why, then, lament and groan as you
deserve. For what greater punishment is there to
those who are uninstructed and disobedient to the
orders of God, than to grieve, to mourn, to envy; in
short, to be disappointed and unhappy? Are you not
<pb id="p.2159"/>
willing to deliver yourself from all this? "And how
shall I deliver myself?" Have you not heard that
you must absolutely control desire, and apply aversion to such things only as are controllable by will;
that you must consent to resign all, - body, possessions, fame, books, tumults, power, exemption from
power? For to whichsoever your disposition is,
you are a slave; you are under subjection; you are
made liable to restraint, to compulsion; you are altogether the property of others. But have that maxim
of Cleanthes always ready,-</p>
<l>Conduct me, Zeus; and thou, O Destiny.
Is it your will that I should go to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>? Conduct
me to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. To Gyaros? To Gyaros. To <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>? To <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>. To prison? To prison. If you
once say, "When may I go to <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>?" you are
undone. This desire, if it be unaccomplished, must
necessarily render you disappointed; and if fulfilled,
vain respecting what ought not to elate you; if, on
the contrary, you are hindered, then you are wretched
through incurring what you do not like. Therefore
give up all these things.</l>
<p>"Athens is a fine place." But it is a much finer
thing to be happy, serene, tranquil, not to have your
affairs dependent on others. " <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is full of tumults
and visits." .But prosperity is worth all difficulties.
If, then, it be a proper time for these, why do not you
withdraw your aversion from them? What necessity
<pb id="p.2160"/>
is there for you to be made to carry your burden, by
being cudgelled like an ass?  Otherwise, consider
that you must always be a slave to him who has the
power to procure your discharge, - to every one who
has the power of hindering you, -and must worship
him like your evil genius.</p>
<p>The only way to real prosperity (let this rule be at
hand morning, noon, and night) is a resignation of
things uncontrollable by will; to esteem nothing as
property; to deliver up all things to our tutelar genius
and to fortune; to leave the control of them to those
whom Zeus hath made such; to be ourselves devoted
to that only which is really ours, - to that which is
incapable of restraint, - and whatever we read or
write or hear, to refer all to this.</p>
<p>Therefore I cannot call any one industrious, if I
hear only that he reads or writes; nor do I call him
so even if he adds the whole night to the day, unless
I know to what he applies it. For not even you
would call him industrious who sits up for the sake of
a girl; nor, therefore, in the other case do I. But
if he does it for fame, I call him ambitious; if for
money, avaricious; if from the desire of learning,
bookish; but not industrious. But if he applies his
labor to his ruling faculty, in order to treat and regulate it conformably to nature, then only I call him
industrious. Never praise or blame any person on
account of outward actions that are common to all;
but only on account of principles. These are the
<pb id="p.2161"/>
peculiar property of each individual, and the things
which make actions good or bad.</p>
<p>Mindful of this, enjoy the present and accept all
things in their season. If you meet in action any of
those things which you have made a subject of study,
rejoice in them. If you have laid aside ill-nature and
reviling; if you have lessened your harshness, indecent language, inconsiderateness, effeminacy; if you
are not moved by the same things as formerly, or in
the same manner as formerly, - you may keep a perpetual festival, to-day for success in one affair, tomorrow for another. How much better a reason for
sacrifice is this than obtaining a consulship or a
government! These things you have from yourself
and from the gods. Remember this, - who it is that
gave them, and to whom and for what purpose.
Habituated once to these reasonings, can you still
think that it makes any difference what place God
allots you?  Are not the gods everywhere at the
same distance? Do not they everywhere see equally
what is doing?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Concerning the quarrelsome and ferocious.</head>
<p>A wise and good person neither quarrels with
any one himself, nor, as far as possible, suffers
another to do so. The life of Socrates affords us an
<pb id="p.2162"/>
example of this too, as well as of other things; since
he not only everywhere avoided quarrelling himself,
but did not even suffer others to quarrel. See in
Xenophon's Banquet how many quarrels he ended;
how, again, he bore with Thrasymachus, with Polus,
with Callicles; how with his wife, how with his son,
who attempted to confute him, and cavilled at him.
For he well remembered that no one is master of the
ruling faculty of another; and therefore he desired
nothing but what was his own. " And what is that? "
Not that any particular person should be dealt with
conformably to nature, for that belongs to others;
but that while they act in their own way, as they
please, he should nevertheless live conformably to
nature, only doing what belongs to himself, in order
to make them live conformably to nature also. For
this is the point that a wise and good person has in
view. To have the command of an army? No; but
if it be allotted him, to properly apply his own powers
in that sphere. To marry? No; but if marriage be
allotted him, to act in this sphere also according to
the laws of nature. But if he expects perfection in
his wife or his child, then he asks to have that for
his own which really belongs to others. And wisdom
consists in this very point, to learn what things are
our own and what belong to others.</p>
<p>What room is there then for quarrelling, to a person thus disposed? For does he wonder at anything
that happens? Does it appear strange to him? Does
<pb id="p.2163"/>
he not prepare for worse and more grievous injuries
from bad people than actually happen to him? Does
he not reckon it so much gained if they come short
of the last extremities?  Such a one has reviled you.
You are much obliged to him that he has not struck
you.  But he has struck you too. You are much
obliged to him that he has not wounded you too.
But he has wounded you too. You are much obliged
to him that he has not killed you. For when did he
ever learn, or from whom, that he is a gentle, that he
is a social, animal; that the very injury itself is a
great mischief to him who inflicts it? As, then, he
has not learned these things, nor believes them, why
should he not follow what appears to be for his interest? Your neighbor has thrown stones. What then;
is it any fault of yours? But your goods are broken.
What then; are you a piece of furniture? No, but
your essence consists in the faculty of will. What
behavior then is assigned you in return? If you are
considering yourself as a wolf, then to bite again,
to throw more stones. But if you ask the question as
a man, then examine your treasure; see what faculties you have brought into the world with you. Are
they fitted for ferocity; for revenge? When is a
horse miserable?  When he is deprived of his natural
faculties; not when he cannot crow, but when he
cannot run. And a dog? Not when he cannot fly,
but when he cannot hunt. Is not a man, then, also
unhappy in the same manner; not he who cannot
<pb id="p.2164"/>
strangle lions or perform great athletic feats (for he
has received no faculties for this purpose from nature);
but he who has lost his rectitude of mind, his fidelity?
This is he who ought to receive public condolence
for the misfortunes into which he is fallen; not, by
Heaven! either he who has the misfortune to be born
or to die; but he whom it has befallen while he lives
to lose what is properly his own; not his paternal
possessions, his paltry estate or his house, his lodging
or his slaves, for none of these are a man's own; but
all these belong to others, are servile, dependent, and
very variously assigned by the disposers of them. But
his personal qualifications as a man, the impressions
which he brought into the world stamped upon his
mind; such as we look for in money, accepting or
rejecting it accordingly.  "What impression has this
piece of money? " "Trajan's."  "Give it me."
" <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>'s." <note anchored="yes">Nero being declared an enemy by the Senate, his coin was, in consequence of this, prohibited and destroyed. -C.</note> Throw it away. It is false; it is good
for nothing. So in the other case. "What stamp
have his principles?"  "Gentleness, social affection,
patience, good-nature."  Bring them hither.  I receive them. I make such a man a citizen; I receive
him for a neighbor, a fellow-traveller. Only see that
he have not the Neronian stamp. Is he passionate?
Is he resentful? Is he querulous? Would he, if he
took the fancy, break the heads of those who fell in
his way? Why then do you call him a man? For
<pb id="p.2165"/>
is everything determined by a mere outward form?
Then say, just as well, that a piece of wax is an apple,
or that it has the smell and taste too. The external
figure is not enough; nor, consequently, is it sufficient
to constitute a man that he has a nose and eyes, if
he have not the proper principles of a man. Such a
one does not understand reason, or apprehend when
he is confuted. He is like an ass. Another is dead
to the sense of shame. He is a worthless creature;
anything rather than a man. Another seeks whom he
may kick or bite; so that he is neither sheep nor ass.
But what then? He is a wild beast.</p>
<p>"Well, but would you have me despised, then?"
By whom, - by those who know you?  And how can
they despise you who know you to be gentle and
modest? But perhaps by those who do not know
you? And what is that to you?  For no other artist
troubles himself about those ignorant of art. "But
people will be much readier to attack me." Why do
you say <emph>me</emph>?  Can any one hurt your will, or restrain
you from treating, conformably to nature, the phenomena of existence? Why, then, are you disturbed
and desirous to make yourself appear formidable?
Why do you not make public proclamation that you
are at peace with all mankind, however they may act;
and that you chiefly laugh at those who suppose they
can hurt you? "These wretches neither know who
I am, nor in what consist my good and evil; nor how
little they can touch what is really mine." Thus the
<pb id="p.2166"/>
inhabitants of a fortified city laugh at the besiegers.
"What trouble, now, are these people giving themselves for nothing! Our wall is secure; we have
provisions for a very long time, and every other
preparation." These are what render a city fortified
and impregnable; but nothing but its principles
render the human soul so. For what wall is so strong,
what body so impenetrable, what possession so unalienable, what dignity so secured against stratagems?
All things else, everywhere else, are mortal, easily
reduced; and whoever in any degree fixes his mind
upon them must necessarily be subject to perturbation,
despair, terrors, lamentations, disappointed desires, and
unavailing aversions.</p>
<p>And will we not fortify, then, the only citadel that
is granted us; and withdrawing ourselves from what
is mortal and servile, diligently improve what is immortal and by nature free? Do we not remember
that no one either hurts or benefits another; but only
the views which we hold concerning everything? It
is this that hurts us; this that overturns us. Here is
the fight, the sedition, the war. It was nothing else
that made Eteocles and Polynices enemies, but their
views concerning empire, and their principles concerning exile; that the one seemed the extremest
evil, the other the greatest good.  Now, the very
nature of every one is to pursue good, to avoid evil;
to esteem him as an enemy and betrayer who deprives
us of the one and involves us in the other, though he
<pb id="p.2167"/>
be a brother, or a son, or father. For nothing is more
nearly related to us than good. So that if good and
evil consist in externals, there is no affection between
father and son, brother and brother; but all is everywhere full of enemies, betrayers, sycophants. But if
a right choice be the only good, and a wrong one the
only evil, what further room is there for quarrelling,
for reviling?  About what can it be?  About what is
nothing to us. Against whom? Against the ignorant,
against the unhappy, against those who are deceived
in the most important respects.</p>
<p>Mindful of this, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> lived in his own house,
patiently bearing a furious wife, a senseless son. For
what were the effects of her fury? The throwing as
much water as she pleased on his head, the trampling a cake under her feet.<note anchored="yes">Alcibiades sent a fine great cake as a present to <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>; which so provoked the jealousy of the meek Xantippe, that she threw it down and stamped upon it. Socrates only laughed, and said, " Now you will have no share in it yourself." - C.</note> " And what is this to me,
if I think such things nothing to me?  This very point
is my business; and neither a tyrant, nor a master;
shall restrain my will; nor multitudes, though I am a
single person; nor one ever so strong, though I am
ever so weak. For this is given by God to every one,
free from restraint."</p>
<p>These principles make friendship in families, concord in cities, peace in nations. They make a person
grateful to God, everywhere courageous, as dealing
<pb id="p.2168"/>
with things merely foreign and of minor importance.
But we, alas ! are able indeed to write and read these
things, and to praise them when they are read; but
very far from being convinced by them. In that case,
what is said of the Lacedemonians, -</p>
<l>Lions at home, foxes at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>,
may be applied to us, too; lions in the school, but
foxes out of it.</l></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Concerning those who are annoyed at being pitied.</head>
<p>It vexes me, say you, to be pitied. Is this your
affair, then, or theirs who pity you?  And further, how is it in your power to prevent it? " It is,
if I show them that I do not need pity." But are
you now in such a condition as not to need pity, or
are you not? "I think I am. But these people do
not pity me for what, if anything, would deserve pity,
my faults; but for poverty, and want of power, and
sicknesses, and deaths, and other things of that kind."
Are you, then, prepared to convince the world that
none of these things is in reality an evil; but that it
is possible for a person to be happy, even when he is
poor, and without honors and power? Or are you
prepared to put on the appearance of being rich and
<pb id="p.2169"/>
powerful? The last of these is the part of an arrogant, silly, worthless fellow. Observe, too, by what
means this fiction must be carried on. You must
hire some poor slaves, and get possessed of a few
little pieces of plate, and often show them in public;
and though they are the same, endeavor to conceal
that they are the same; you must have gay clothes
and other finery, and make a show of being honored
by your great people; and endeavor to sup with
them, or be thought to sup with them; and use some
vile arts with your person, to make it appear handsomer and genteeler than it really is. All this you
must contrive, if you would take the second way not
to be pitied. And the first is impracticable as well as
tedious, to undertake the very thing that Zeus himself could not do, - to convince all mankind what
things are really good and evil. Is this granted you?
The only thing granted you is to convince yourself;
and you have not yet done that; and yet do you
undertake to convince others? Why, who has lived
so long with you as you have with yourself? Who
is so likely to have faith in you, in order to be convinced by you, as yourself?  Who is more truly a
well-wisher or a friend to you than yourself?  How
is it, then, that you have not yet convinced yourself?
Should you not now revolve these things? What
you were studying was this: to learn to be exempt
from grief, perturbation, and meanness, and to be
free. Have you not heard, then, that the only way
<pb id="p.2170"/>
that leads to this is to give up what is beyond the
control of will; to withdraw from it, and confess that
it belongs to others? To what order of things belongs another's opinion about you? "Things uncontrollable by will." Is it nothing then to you?
" Nothing."  While you are still piqued and disturbed about it, then, do you consider that you are
convinced concerning good and evil?</p>
<p>Letting others alone, then, why will you not be
your own scholar and teacher? Let others look to it,
whether it be for their advantage to think and act
contrary to nature; but no one is nearer to me than
myself. What means this? I have heard the reasonings of philosophers, and assented to them; yet,
in fact, I am not the more relieved. Am I so stupid?
And yet, in other things to which I had an inclination, I was not found very stupid; but I quickly
learned grammar and the exercises of the palaestra,
and geometry, and the solution of syllogisms. Has
not reason, then, convinced me? And yet there is
no one of the other things that I so much approved
or liked from the very first. And now I read concerning these subjects, I hear discourses upon them,
I write about them, and I have not yet found any
principle more sure then this. What, then, do I
need? Is not this the difficulty, that the contrary
principles are not removed out of my mind? Is it
not that I have not strengthened these opinions by
exercise, nor practised them in action; but, like arms
<pb id="p.2171"/>
thrown aside, they are grown rusty, and do not suit
me? Yet neither in the palaestra, nor writing, nor
reading, nor solving syllogisms, am I contented with
merely learning; but I apply in every way the forms
of arguments which are presented to me, and I invent
others; and the same of convertible propositions.
But the necessary principles by which I might become exempted from fear, grief, and passion, and be
unrestrained and free, I do not exercise, nor bestow
on them the proper care. And then I trouble myself
what others will say of me; whether I shall appear
to them worthy of regard; whether I shall appear
happy. Will you not see, foolish man, what you can
say of <emph>yourself</emph>; what sort of person you appear to
<emph>yourself</emph> in your opinions, in your desires, in your
aversions, in your pursuits, in your preparation, in
your intention, in the other proper works of a man?
But instead of that, do you trouble yourself whether
others pity you? "Very true. But I am pitied without reason." Then are you not pained by this?
And is not he who is in pain to be pitied? " Yes."
How, then, are you pitied without reason? For you
render yourself worthy of pity by what you suffer upon
being pitied.</p>
<p>What says Antisthenes, then? Have you never
heard?- " It is kingly, O <placeName key="tgn,2074299">Cyrus</placeName>, to do well and to be
ill spoken of." My head is well, and all around me
think it aches. What is that to me? I am free
from a fever; and they compassionate me as if I had
<pb id="p.2172"/>
one. "Poor soul, what a long while have you had
this fever! " I say, too, with a dismal countenance,
Ay, indeed, it is now a long time that I have been
ill. "What can be the consequence, then? " What
pleases God. And at the same time I secretly laugh
at those who pity me. What forbids, then, but that
the same may be done in the other case? I am
poor, but I have right principles concerning poverty.
What is it to me, then, if people pity me for my
poverty? I am not in power and others are; but I
have such opinions as I ought to have concerning
power and the want of power. Let them see to it
who pity me. I am neither hungry, nor thirsty, nor
cold. But because they are hungry and thirsty, they
suppose me to be so too. What can I do for them?
Am I to go about making proclamation, and saying,
Do not deceive yourselves, good people, I am very
well; I care for neither poverty, nor want of power,
nor anything else but right principles? These I possess unrestrained, and care for nothing further.</p>
<p>But what trifling is this! How have I right principles when I am not contented to be what I am; but
am in agony as to how I shall appear? "But others
will get more, and be preferred to me." Well, what
is more reasonable than that they who take pains for
anything should get most in that particular direction
in which they take pains? They have taken pains for
power; you, for right principles. They, for riches;
you, for a proper use of the phenomena of existence.
<pb id="p.2173"/>
See whether they have the advantage of you in that
for which you have taken pains, and which they
neglect; if they judge better concerning the natural
bounds and limits of things; if their desires are less
often disappointed than yours, their aversions less
often incurred; if they aim better in their intentions,
in their purposes, in their pursuits; if they preserve
a becoming behavior as men, as sons, as parents, and
so on with the other relations of life. But if they are
in power, and you not, why will you not speak the
truth to yourself; that you do nothing for the sake of
power, but that they do everything? It were very
reasonable that he who carefully seeks anything should
be less successful than he who neglects it! "No;
but since I take care to have right principles, it is
more reasonable that I should excel." Yes, in respect
to what you take pains about, your principles. But
give up to others the things in which they have taken
more pains than you. Else it is just as if, because
you have right principles, you should expect to aim
an arrow better than an archer, or to forge better than
a smith. In that case cease to take pains about principles, and apply yourself to those things which you
wish to possess, and then begin crying, if you do not
succeed; for you deserve to cry. But now you claim
that you are engaged and absorbed in other things;
and they say well that no man can be of two trades.
One man, as soon as he rises and goes out, seeks to
whom he may pay his compliments, whom he may
<pb id="p.2174"/>
flatter, to whom he may send a present, how he may
please the favorite; how, by doing mischief to one,
he may oblige another. Whenever he prays, he prays
for things like these; whenever he sacrifices, he sacrifices for things like these. To these he transfers the
Pythagorean precept,-</p>
<l>Let not the stealing god of Sleep surprise.</l>
<p><emph>Where have I failed</emph> in point of flattery?  <emph>What have I done</emph>, - anything like a free, brave-spirited
man?<note anchored="yes">See the Pythagorean verses (quoted in Book III. c. 10) of which these questions are a parody - C.</note> If he should find anything of this sort, he rebukes and accuses himself. " What business had you
to say that? For could you not have lied? Even
the philosophers say there is no objection against telling a lie."</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, if you have in reality been
careful about nothing else but to make a right use of
the phenomena of existence; then, as soon as you
are up in the morning, consider what you need in
order to be free from passion; what, to enjoy tranquillity?  "In what do I consist,- merely in body,
in estate, in reputation? None of these. What, then?
I am a reasonable creature. What, then, is required
of me? "  Meditate upon your actions.  <emph>Where have I failed</emph> in any requisite for prosperity?   <emph>What have I done</emph>, either unfriendly or unsocial?  <emph>What have I omitted</emph> that was necessary in these points?
<pb id="p.2175"/></p>
<p>Since there is so much difference, then, in your desires, your actions, your wishes, would you yet have
an equal share with others in those things about which
you have not taken pains, and they have? And do
you wonder, after all, and are you out of humor, if
they pity you? But they are not out of humor, if you
pity them. Why? Because they are convinced that
they are in possession of their proper good; but you
are not convinced that you are. Hence you are not
contented with your own condition, but desire theirs;
whereas they are contented with theirs, and do not
desire yours. For if you were really convinced that
it is you who are in possession of what is good, and
that they are mistaken, you would not so much as
think what they say about you.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Of fearlessness.</head>
<p>What makes a tyrant formidable? His guards,
say you, and their swords; they who protect
his bedchamber, and they who keep out intruders.
Why, then, if you bring a child to him amidst these
guards, is it not afraid? Is it because the child does
not know what they mean? Suppose, then, that any
one knows what is meant by guards, and that they are
armed with swords; and for that very reason comes
<pb id="p.2176"/>
in the tyrant's way, being desirous, on account of some
misfortune, to die, and seeking to die easily by the
hand of another. Does such a man fear the guards?
No; for he desires the very thing that renders them
formidable. Well, then; if any one, being without an
absolute desire to live or die, but indifferent to it,
comes in the way of a tyrant, what prevents his approaching him without fear? Nothing. If, then, another should think concerning his estate, or wife, or
children, as this man thinks concerning his body;
and, in short, from some madness or folly should be
of such a disposition as not to care whether he has
them or not; but just as children, playing with shells,
are busied with the play, but not with the shells, so he
should pay no regard to these affairs, except to carry
on the play with them, what tyrant, what guards, or
swords are any longer formidable to such a man?</p>
<p>And is it possible that any one should be thus disposed towards these things from madness, and the
Galileans from mere habit; yet that no one should
be able to learn, from reason and demonstration, that
God -made all things in the world, and made the whole
world itself unrestrained and perfect, and all its parts
for the use of the whole? All other creatures are indeed excluded from a power of comprehending the
administration of the world; but a reasonable being
has abilities for the consideration of all these things,
- both that itself is a part, and what part; and that it
is fit the parts should submit to the whole. Besides,
<pb id="p.2177"/>
being by nature constituted noble, magnanimous, and
free, it sees that of the things which relate to it some
are unrestrained and in its own power, some restrained
and in the power of others, - the unrestrained, such
as depend on will; the restrained, such as do not
depend on it. And for this reason, if it esteems its
good and its interest to consist in things unrestrained
and in its own power, it will be free, prosperous,
happy, safe, magnanimous, pious, thankful to God for
everything, never finding fault with anything, never
censuring anything that is brought about by him. But
if it esteems its good and its interest to consist in externals, and things uncontrollable by will, it must necessarily be restrained, be hindered, be enslaved to
those who have the power over those things which it
admires and fears; it must necessarily be impious, as
supposing itself injured by God, and unjust, as claiming more than its share; it must necessarily, too, be
abject and base.</p>
<p>Why may not he, who discerns these things, live
with an easy and light heart, quietly awaiting whatever may happen, and bearing contentedly what has
happened?  Shall it be poverty?  Bring it; and you
shall see what poverty is when it is met well.  Would
you have power? Bring toils too along with it.
Banishment? Wherever I go, it will be well with me
there; for it was well with me here, - not on account
of the place, but of the principles which I shall carry
away with me; for no one can deprive me of these;
<pb id="p.2178"/>
on the contrary, they alone are my property, and
cannot be taken away; and their possession suffices
me wherever I am, or whatever I do.</p>
<p>" But it is now time to die." What is that you call
dying?  Do not talk of the thing in a tragic strain;
but state the thing as it is, that it is time for your
material part to revert whence it came. And where
is the terror of this? What part of the world is going
to be lost?  What is going to happen that is new
or prodigious? Is it for this that a tyrant is formidable? Is it on this account that the swords of his
guards seem so large and sharp?  Try these things
upon others.  For my part I have examined the
whole. No one has authority over me. God has
made me free; I know his commands; after this no
one can enslave me. I have a proper vindicator of
my freedom; proper judges. Are you the master of
my body? But what is that to me?   Of my little
estate? But what is that to me? Of banishment
and chains? Why, all these again, and my whole
body, I give up to you; make a trial of your power
whenever you please, and you will find how far it
extends.</p>
<p>Whom, then, can I any longer fear,- those who
guard the chamber?  Lest they should do  what,-
shut me out? If they find me desirous to come in,
let them. "Why do you come to the door, then?"
Because it is fitting for me that, while the play lasts,
I should play too. " How then are you incapable of
<pb id="p.2179"/>
being shut out?"  Because, if I am not admitted,
I would not wish to go in; but would much rather
that things should be as they are, for I esteem what
God wills to be better than what I will. To him
I yield myself, as a servant and a follower.  My pursuits, my desires, my very will, must coincide with
his, Being shut out does not affect me; but those
who push to get in. Why, then, do not I push too?
Because I know that there is no really good thing distributed to those who get in. But when I hear any
one congratulated on the favor of Caesar, I ask what
he has got. "A province."  Has he the needed wisdom also?  "A public office."  Has he with it the
knowledge how to use it? If not, why should I
push my way in?</p>
<p>Some one scatters nuts and figs.  Children scramble and quarrel for them; but not men, for they
think them trifles. But if any one should scatter
shells, not even children would scramble for these.
Provinces are being distributed; let children look to
it. Money; let children look to it.  Military command, a consulship; let children scramble for them.
Let these be shut out, be beaten, kiss the hands of
the giver or of his slaves.  But to me they are mere
figs and nuts. " What then is to be done? "  If you
miss them, while he is throwing them, do not trouble
yourself about it; but if a fig should fall into your lap,
take it, and eat it; for one may pay so much regard
even to a fig. But if I am to stoop and throw down
<pb id="p.2180"/>
one [rival], or be thrown down by another, and flatter
those who succeed, a fig is not worth this, nor is any
other of those things which are not really good, and
which the philosophers have persuaded me not to
esteem as good.</p>
<p>Show me the swords of the guards. "See how
large and how sharp they are." What, then, can
these great and sharp swords do?   "They kill."
And what can a fever do?  "Nothing else."  And a
[falling] tile? "Nothing else."  Do you then wish
me to be bewildered by all these things, and to worship them, and to go about as a slave to them all?
Heaven forbid ! But having once learned that everything that is born must likewise die (that the world
may not be at a stand, nor the course of it hindered),
I no longer see any difference, whether this be effected
by a fever, or a tile, or a soldier; but if any comparison is to be made, I know that the soldier will effect
it with less pain and more speedily. Since then I
neither fear any of those things which he can inflict
upon me, nor covet anything which he can bestow,
why do I stand any longer in awe of a tyrant? Why
am I amazed at him? Why do I fear his guards?
Why do I rejoice, if he speaks kindly to me, and
receives me graciously; and why boast to others of
my reception? For is he <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> or Diogenes, that
his praise should show what I am? Or have I set
my heart on imitating his manners? But to keep up
the play I go to him and serve him, so long as he
<pb id="p.2181"/>
commands nothing unreasonable or improper. But
if he should say to me, "Go to <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, and bring
<placeName key="tgn,1018742">Leon</placeName>,"<note anchored="yes">As with <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>; see note, <emph>ante.</emph></note> I bid him seek another, for I play no longer.
"Lead him away." I follow as a part of the play.
"But your head will be taken off."  And will his
own remain on forever; or yours, who obey him?
" But you will be thrown out unburied." If I am
identical with my corpse, I shall be thrown out; but
if I am something else than the corpse, speak more
handsomely, as the thing is, and do not think to
frighten me. These things are frightful to children
and fools. But if any one who has once entered into
the school of a philosopher knows not what he himself is, then he deserves to be frightened, and to flatter the last object of flattery; if he has not yet learnt
that he is neither flesh, nor bones, nor nerves, but is
that which makes use of these, and regulates and
comprehends the phenomena of existence.</p>
<p>"Well; but these reasonings make men despise
the laws." And what reasonings, then, render those
who use them more obedient to the laws? But the
law of fools is no law. And yet, see how these reasonings render us properly disposed, even towards such
persons, since they teach us not to assert against them
any claim wherein they can surpass us. They teach -
us to give up body, to give up estate, children, parents, brothers, to yield everything, to let go everything, excepting only principles; which even Zeus
<pb id="p.2182"/>
has excepted and decreed to be every one's own
property. What unreasonableness, what breach of
the laws, is there in this? Where you are superior
and stronger, there I give way to you. Where, on
the contrary, I am superior, do you submit to me;
for this has been my study, and not yours. Your
study has been to walk upon a mosaic floor, to be
attended by your servants and clients, to wear fine
clothes, to have a great number of hunters, fiddlers,
and players. Do I lay any claim to these? On the
other hand, have you made a study of principles, or
even of your own reason? Do you know of what
parts it consists; how they are combined and
joined, and with what powers?  Why, then, do you
take it amiss, if another, who has studied them, has
the advantage of you in these things?  "But they
are of all things the greatest." Well; and who restrains you from being conversant with them, and
attending to them  ever so carefully?  Or who is
better provided with books, with leisure, with assistants? Only turn your thoughts now and then to
these matters; bestow but a little time upon your
own ruling faculty. Consider what is the power you
have, and whence it came, that uses all other things,
that examines them all, that chooses, that rejects.
*But while you employ yourself merely about externals, you will possess those indeed beyond all rivals;
but all else will be, just as you elect to have it, sordid
and neglected.

<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Concerning such as hastily assume the philosophic dress.</head>
<p>Never commend or censure any one for common
actions, nor attribute to them either skilfulness
or unskilfulness; and thus you will at once be free
both from rashness and ill-nature. Such a one bathes
hastily. Does he therefore do it ill? Not at all.
-But what?   Hastily.  "Is everything well done,
then? " By no means. But what is done from good
principles is well done; what from bad ones, ill. Till
you know from what principle any one acts, neither
commend nor censure the action. But the principle
is not easily discerned from the external appearance.
Such a one is a carpenter. Why? He uses an axe.
What proof is that? Such a one is a musician, for
he sings. What proof is that? Such a one is a philosopher. Why? Because he wears a cloak and long
hair. What then do mountebanks wear? And so,
when people see any.of these acting indecently, they
presently say, " See what the philosopher does." But
they ought rather, from his acting indecently, to say
that he is no philosopher. For if indeed the essence
of philosophic pursuits is to wear a cloak and long
hair, they say right; but if it be rather to keep him-
<pb id="p.2184"/>
self free from faults, since he does not fulfil his profession, why do not they deprive him of his title?
For this is the way with regard to other arts. When
we see any one handle an axe awkwardly, we do not
say, "Where is the use of this art?  See how poorly
carpenters acquit themselves," but we say the very
contrary, "This man is no carpenter; for he handles
an axe awkwardly."  So, if we hear any one sing
badly, we do not say, " Observe how musicians sing,"
but rather, "This fellow is no musician." It is with
regard to philosophy alone that people are thus
affected. When they see any one acting inconsistently with the profession of a philosopher, they do.
not take away his title; but assuming that he is a
philosopher, and then reasoning from his improper
behavior, they infer that philosophy is of no use.</p>
<p>"What then is the reason of this?"  Because we
pay some regard to the idea which we have of a
carpenter and a musician, and so of other artists, but
not of a philosopher; which idea being thus vague
and confused, we judge of it only from external appearances. And of what other art do we form our
opinion from the dress or the hair? Has it not
principles too, and materials, and an aim? What,
then, are the materials of a philosopher, -a cloak?
No, but reason. What his aim, -to wear a cloak?
No, but to have his reason in good order. What are
his principles? Are they how to get a great beard,
or long hair?  No, but rather, as <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName> expresses
<pb id="p.2185"/>
it, to know the elements of reason, what is each
separately and how linked together, and what their
consequences.</p>
<p>Why, then, will you not first see, whether when
acting improperly he fulfils his profession, ere you
proceed to blame the study? Whereas now, when
acting soberly yourself, you say, in regard to whatever
he appears to do amiss, " Observe the philosopher ! "
as if it were proper to call a person who does such
things a philosopher.  And again, "This is philosophical !" But you do not say, " Observe the carpenter, or observe the musician," when you know one
of them to be an adulterer, or see him to be a glutton.
So, in some small degree, even you perceive what the
profession of a philosopher is, but are misled and
confounded by your own carelessness. And, indeed,
even those called philosophers enter upon their profession by commonplace beginnings. As soon as they
have put on the cloak and let their beards grow, they
cry, " I am a philosopher."  Yet no one says, " I am
a musician," merely because he has bought a fiddle
and fiddlestick; nor, "I am a smith," because he is
dressed in the cap and apron. But they take their
name from their art, not from their garb.</p>
<p>For this reason, <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName> was in the right to say,
"I long endeavored to conceal my embracing the
philosophic life; and it was of use to me. For, in
the first place, I knew that whatever I did right I did
not for spectators, but for myself. I ate in a seemly
<pb id="p.2186"/>
manner, for my own approbation. I preserved composure of look and manner, all for God and myself.
Then, as I contended alone, I alone was in danger.
Philosophy was in no danger, on my doing anything
shameful or unbecoming; nor did I hurt the rest of
the world, which, by offending as a philosopher, I
might have done.  For this reason, they who were
ignorant of my intention, used to wonder that while
I conversed and lived entirely with philosophers, I
never took up the character.  And where was the
harm, that I should be discovered to be a philosopher
by my actions, rather than by the usual badges? See
how I eat, how I drink, how I sleep, how I bear, how
I forbear; how I assist others; how I direct my desires, how my aversions; how I preserve the natural
and acquired relations, without confusion and without
obstruction. Judge of me hence, if you can. But if
you are so deaf and blind that you would not suppose
Hephaistos himself to be a good smith, unless you
saw the cap upon his head, where is the harm in not
being found out by so foolish a judge?"</p>
<p>It was thus, too, that <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> concealed himself
from the multitude; and some even came and desired him to introduce them to philosophers. Was
he accustomed to be displeased, then, like us; and
to say, What! do not you take me for a philosopher?
No, he took them and introduced them; contented
with merely being a philosopher, and rejoicing in
feeling no annoyance that he was not thought one.
<pb id="p.2187"/>
For he remembered his business; and what is the
business of a wise and good man, -to have many
scholars? By no means.  Let those see to it who
have made this their study. Well, then; is it to be
a perfect master of difficult theorems?  Let others
see to that too.  What, then, was his position, and
what did he desire to be?   What constituted his hurt
or advantage? "If," said he, " any one can still hurt
me, I am accomplishing nothing;  If I depend for
my advantage upon another, I am nothing. Have
I any wish unaccomplished?  Then I am unhappy."
To such a combat he invited every one, and, in my
opinion, yielded to no one. But do you think it was
by making proclamation, and saying, <emph>"I</emph> am such a
one "? Far from it; but by being such a one. For
it is folly and insolence to say, "I am passive and
undisturbed. Be it known to you, mortals, that while
you are disturbed and vexed about things of no value,
I alone am free from all perturbation." Are you,
then, so little satisfied with your exemption from pain.
that you must needs make proclamation: "Come
hither, all you who have the gout, or the headache, or
a fever, or are lame, or blind; and see <emph>me</emph>, free from
every distemper"? This is vain and shocking, unless
you can show, like Aesculapius, by what method of
cure they may presently become as free from distempers as yourself, and can bring your own health as
a proof of it.</p>
<p>Such is the Cynic honored with the sceptre and
<pb id="p.2188"/>
diadem from Zeus; who says, "That you may see, O
mankind, that you do not seek happiness and tranquillity where it is, but where it is not, behold, I am
sent an example to you from God,-who have neither estate, nor house, nor wife, nor children, nor
even a bed, coat, or furniture.  And yet see how
in what good condition I am. Try me; and if you
see me free from perturbation, hear the remedies,
and by what means I was cured."  This now is benevolent and noble. But consider whose business it
is. That of Zeus, or his whom he judges worthy of
this office; that he may never show to the world
anything to impeach his own testimony for virtue
and against externals.</p>

for company or place or amusement, as boys do the

<p>But now, they who have only such an inclination
to philosophy as weak stomachs have to some kinds
of food, of which they will presently grow sick, expect
to hasten to the sceptre, to the kingdom. They let
their hair grow, assume the cloak, bare the shoulder,
wrangle with all they meet; and if they see any one
<pb id="p.2189"/>
in a thick, warm coat, must needs wrangle with him.
First harden yourself against all weather, man. Consider your inclination; whether it be not that of a
weak stomach, or of a longing woman. First study to
conceal what you are; philosophize a little while by
yourself.  Fruit is produced thus: the seed must
first be buried in the ground, lie hid there some time,
and grow up by degrees, that it may come to perfection. But if it produces the ear before the stalk has
its proper joints, it is imperfect, and of the garden of
Adonis.<note anchored="yes">At the feast of Adonis there were carried about little
earthen pots filled with mould, in which grew several sorts of
herbs. These were called gardens; and from thence the gardens of Adonis came to be proverbially applied to things
unfruitful or fading; because those herbs were only sowed so
long before the festival as to sprout forth and be green at that
time, and then were presently cast into the water. - C.</note> Now <emph>you</emph> are a poor plant of this kind.
You have blossomed too soon; the winter will kill
you. See what countrymen say about seeds of any
sort, when the warm weather comes too early. They
are in great anxiety for fear the seeds should shoot
out too luxuriantly; and then one frost taking them
may show how prejudicial their forwardness was. Beware you, too, O man. You have shot out luxuriantly; you have sprung forth towards a trifling fame,
before the proper season. You seem to be somebody,
as a fool may among fools.  You will be taken by the
frost; or rather, you are already frozen downward at
the root; you still blossom, indeed, a little at the
<pb id="p.2190"/>
top, and therefore you think you are still alive and
flourishing.</p>
<p>Let us, at least, ripen naturally. Why do you lay
us open? Why do you force us? We cannot yet
bear the air. Suffer the root to grow; then the first,
then the second, then the third joint of the stalk to
spring from it; and thus Nature will force out the
fruit, whether I will or not. For who that is charged
with such principles, but must perceive, too, his own
powers, and strive to put them in practice. Not even
a bull is ignorant of his own powers, when any wild
beast approaches the herd, nor waits he for any one
to encourage him; nor does a dog when he spies any
game. And if I have the powers of a good man,
shall I wait for you to qualify me for my own proper
actions? But believe me, I have them not quite yet.
Why, then, would you wish me to be withered before
my time, as you are?</p></div2>

<head>Concerning a person who had grown immodest.</head>
<p>When you see another in power, set this against
it, that you have the advantage of not needing power. When you see another rich, see what
you have instead of riches; for if you have nothing in their stead, you are miserable.  But if you
<pb id="p.2191"/>
have the advantage of not needing riches, know that
you have something more than he has, and of far
greater value.  Another possesses a handsome woman; you the happiness of not desiring a handsome
woman. Do you think these are little matters? And
what would not those very persons give, who are rich
and powerful, and possess handsome women, if they
were only able to despise riches and power, and those
very women whom they love and whom they possess !
Do not you know of what nature the thirst of one in
a fever is?  It has no resemblance to that of a person
in health.  The latter drinks and is satisfied.  But
the other, after being delighted a very little while, is
nauseated, the water becomes bile, he is sick at his
stomach, and becomes more thirsty than ever.  It
is the same with avarice, ambition, lust.  Presently
comes jealousy, fear of loss, unbecoming words, designs, and actions.</p>
<p>"And what," say you, "do I lose?"   You were
modest, man, and are so no longer. Have you lost
nothing? Instead of Chrysippus and <placeName key="tgn,2786861">Zeno</placeName>, you read
Aristides <note anchored="yes">An indecent poet of <placeName key="tgn,7002386">Miletus</placeName>. - C.</note> and Euenus.<note anchored="yes">A writer of amorous verses.- C.</note>  Have you lost nothing,
then? Instead of <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> and Diogenes, you admire
him who can corrupt and seduce most women. You
would be handsome, by decking your person, when
you are not really so.  You love to appear in fine
clothes, to attract female eyes; and if you anywhere
<pb id="p.2192"/>
meet with a good perfumer, you esteem yourself a
happy man. But formerly you did not so much as
think of any of these things; but only where you
might find a decent discourse, a worthy person, a
noble design. For this reason, you used to appear
like a man both at home and abroad; to wear
a manly dress; to hold discourses worthy of a man.
And after this, do you tell me you have lost nothing?
What, then; do men lose nothing but money? Is not
modesty to be lost? Is not decency to be lost?  Or
can he who loses these suffer no injury? You indeed
perhaps no longer think anything of this sort to be
an injury. But there was once a time when you
accounted this to be the only injury and hurt; when
you were anxiously afraid lest any one should shake
your regard from such discourses and actions. See,
it is not shaken by another, but by yourself. Fight
against yourself, recover yourself to decency, to modesty, to freedom. If you had formerly been told any
of these things of me, that one prevailed on me to
commit adultery, to wear such a dress as yours, or to
be perfumed, would you not have gone and laid violent hands on the man who thus abused me? And
will you not now help yourself?  For how much
easier is that sort of assistance? You need not kill,
or fetter, or affront, or go to law with any one; but
merely talk with yourself, the person who will most
readily be persuaded by you, and with whom no one
has greater weight than you. And, in the first place,
<pb id="p.2193"/>
condemn your actions; but when you have condemned them, do not despair of yourself, nor be like
those poor-spirited people who, when they have once
given way, abandon themselves entirely, and are carried along as by a torrent. Take example from the
wrestling-masters. Has the boy fallen down? Get
up again, they say; wrestle again, till you have acquired strength. Be you affected in the same manner.  For be assured that there is nothing more
tractable than the human mind.  You need but will,
and it is done, it is set right; as, on the contrary,
you need but nod over the work, and it is ruined.
For both ruin and recovery are from within.</p>
<p>" And, after all, what good will this do me?  " What
greater good do you seek? From being impudent,
you will become modest; from indecent, decent;
from dissolute, sober. But if you seek any greater
things than these, do as you are doing. It is no longer in the power of any God to save you.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<head>What things we are to despise, and what chiefly to value.</head>
<p>The doubts and perplexities of all men are concerning externals, - what they shall do; how
it will be; what will be the event; whether this
<pb id="p.2194"/>
thing will happen, or that. All this is the talk of
persons engaged in things uncontrollable by will.
For who says, How shall I do, not to assent to what
is false; how, not to dissent from what is true? If
any one is of such a good disposition as to be anxious
about these things, I will remind him: " Why are you
anxious? It is in your own power. Be assured. Do
not hastily give your assent before you have applied
those tests prescribed by nature." Again, if he be
anxious, for fear lest he should fail of what he seeks
or incur what he shuns, I will first embrace him, because, slighting what others are fluttered and terrified about, he takes care of what is his own, where his
very being is; then I will say to him: " If you would
not fail of what you seek, or incur what you shun, desire nothing that belongs to others; shun nothing that
lies beyond your own control; otherwise you must
necessarily be disappointed in what you seek, and
incur what you shun."  Where is the doubt here?
Where the room for, <emph>How will it be?  What will be the event</emph>?  And <emph>fill this happen, or that</emph>? Is not
the event uncontrollable by will?  "Yes."  And does
not the essence of good and evil consist in what is
within the control of will? It is in your power, then,
to treat every event conformably to Nature?  Can
any one restrain you?  "No one."  Then do not say
to me any more, <emph>How will it be</emph>?  For, however
it be, you will set it right, and the event to you *ill
be auspicious.
<pb id="p.2195"/></p>
<p>Pray what would <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> have been, if he had
said, "What can be done to prevent a great lion, or a
large boar, or savage men, from coming in my way?"
Why, what is that to you? If a large boar should
come in your way, you will fight the greater combat;
if wicked men, you will deliver the world from wicked
men. "But then if I should die by this means?"
You will die as a good man, in the performance of a
gallant action.  For since, at all events, one must
die, one must necessarily be found doing something,
either tilling, or digging, or trading, or serving a consulship, or sick with indigestion or dysentery.  At
what employment, then, would you have death find
you? For my part, I would have it to be some humane, beneficent, public-spirited, noble action. But
if I cannot be found doing any such great things,
yet, at least, I would be doing what I am incapable of
being restrained from, what is given me to do, - correcting myself, improving that faculty which makes
use of the phenomena of existence to procure tranquillity, and render to the several relations of life
their due; and if I am so fortunate, advancing still
further to the security of judging right.  If death
overtakes me in such a situation, it is enough for me
if I can stretch out my hands to God, and say, "The
opportunities which I have received from thee of
comprehending and obeying thy administration, I
have not neglected. As far as in me lay, I have not
dishonored thee. See how I have used my percep-
<pb id="p.2196"/>
tions; how my convictions. Have I at any time
found fault with thee? Have I been discontented
at thy dispensations, or wished them  otherwise?
Have I transgressed the relations of life? I thank
thee that thou hast brought me into being. I am
satisfied with the time that I have enjoyed the things
which thou hast given me. Receive them back again,
and distribute them as thou wilt; for they were all
thine, and thou gavest them to me."</p>
<p>Is it not enough to depart in this mood of mind?
And what life is better and more becoming than that
of such a one; or what conclusion happier? But
in order to attain these advantages, there are no inconsiderable risks to be encountered. You cannot
seek a consulship and these things too, nor toil for an
estate and these things too, nor take charge of your
slaves and yourself too. But if you insist on anything
of what belongs to others, then what is your own is
lost. This is the nature of the affair. Nothing is to
be had for nothing. And where is the wonder? If
you would be consul, you must watch, run about, kiss
hands, be wearied down with waiting at the doors of
others, must say and do many slavish things, send
gifts to many, daily presents to some. And for what
result? Twelve bundles of rods; <note anchored="yes">The ensigns of the consular office - C.</note> to sit three or four
times on the tribunal; to give the games of the circus,
and suppers in baskets to all the world; or let any
one show me what there is in it more than this. Will
<pb id="p.2197"/>
you, then, employ no expense and no pains to acquire
peace and tranquillity, to sleep sound while you do
sleep, to be thoroughly awake while you are awake, to
fear nothing, to be anxious for nothing? But if anything belonging to you be lost or idly wasted, while
you are thus engaged, or another gets what you ought
to have had, will you immediately begin fretting at
what has happened? Will you not compare the exchange you have made, - how much for how much?
But you would have such great things for nothing, I
suppose. And how can you? Two trades cannot be
combined; you cannot bestow your care both upon
externals and your own ruling faculty. But if you
would have the former, let the latter alone; or you
will succeed in neither, while you are drawn in different ways by the two. On the other hand, if you
would have the latter, let the former alone. "The
oil will be spilled, the furniture will be spoiled;"
but still I shall be free from passion. "There will
be a fire when I am out of the way, and the books
will be destroyed ;" but still I shall make a right use
of the phenomena of existence. " But I shall have
nothing to eat." If I am so unlucky, dying is a safe
harbor. That is the harbor for all, - death; that is the
refuge; and for that reason there is nothing difficult
in life. You may go out of doors when you please,
and be troubled with smoke no longer.</p>
<p>Why, then, are you anxious? Why break your
rest? Why do you not calculate where your good
<pb id="p.2198"/>
and evil lie, and say, "They are both in my own
power; nor can any deprive me of the one, nor
involve me against my will in the other." Why,
then, do not I lay myself down and sleep? What is
my own is safe. Let what belongs to others look to
itself, who carries it off, how it is distributed by him
who hath the disposal of it. Who am I, to will that
it should be so and so? For is the option given to
me? Has any one made me the dispenser of it?
What I have in my own disposal is enough for me.
I must make the best I can of this. Other things
must be as their master pleases.</p>
<p>Does any one who has these things before his eyes
lie sleepless, and shift from  side to side? What
would he have, or what needs he, - Patroclus,<note anchored="yes">This whole paragraph refers to the lament of Achilles over Patroclus. Iliad, xix. 315, etc. - H.</note> or
Antilochus, or Menelaus? Why, did he ever think
any one of his friends immortal?  When was it not
obvious that on the morrow, or the next day, he himself or that friend might die?  "Ay, very true," he
says; " but I reckoned that he would survive me, and
bring up my son." Because you were a fool, and
reckoned upon uncertainties. Why, then, do you not
blame yourself, instead of sitting in tears, like a girl?
" But he used to set my dinner before me." Because
he was alive, foolish man; but now he cannot. But
Automedon will set it before you; and if he should
die, you will find somebody else. What if the vessel
<pb id="p.2199"/>
in which your meat used to be cooked should happen
to be broken; must you die with hunger because you
have not your old vessel? Do you not send and buy
a new one?</p>
<p rend="center">" What greater evil could afflict my breast? "
Is <emph>this</emph> your evil, then?  And, instead of removing it,
do you accuse your mother, that she did not foretell
it to you, that you might have spent your whole life
in grieving from that time forward?</p>
<p>Do you not think now that Homer composed all
this on purpose to show us that the noblest, the

nevertheless be the most unfortunate and wretched,

<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Of purity.</head>
<p></p><p rend="left">Some doubt whether the love of society be comprehended in the nature of man; and yet these
very persons do not seem to me to doubt but that
purity is by all means comprehended in it; and that
by this, if by anything, it is distinguished from brute
animals. When, therefore, we see any animal cleaning itself, we are apt to cry, with wonder, that it is
like a human being: On the contrary, if an animal
<pb id="p.2200"/>
is censured, we are presently apt to say, by way of
excuse, that it is not a human being. Such excellence do we suppose to be in man, which we first
received from the gods. For as they are by nature
pure and uncorrupt, in proportion as men approach
to them by reason, they are tenacious of purity and
incorruption. But since it is impracticable that their
essence, composed of such materials, should be absolutely pure, it is the office of reason to endeavor to
render it as pure as possible.</p>
<p>The first and highest purity or impurity, then, is
that which is formed in the soul. But you will not
find the impurity of the soul and body to be alike.
For what stain can you find in the soul, unless it be
something which renders it impure in its operations?
Now, the operations of the soul are its pursuits and
avoidances, its desires, aversions, preparations, intentions, assents. What, then, is that which renders it
defiled and impure in these operations?  Nothing
else than its perverse judgments. So that the impurity of the soul consists in wicked principles, and
its purification in forming right principles; and that
is pure which has right principles, for that alone is
unmixed and undefiled in its operations.</p>
<p>Now we should, as far as possible, endeavor after
something like this in the body, too. It is impossible
but that in such a composition as man, there must be
a discharge of superfluous phlegm. For this reason
Nature has made hands, and the nostrils themselves
<pb id="p.2201"/>
as channels to let out the moisture; nor can this be
neglected with propriety. It was impossible but that
the feet should be bemired and soiled from what they
pass through. Therefore Nature has prepared water
and hands. It was impossible but that some uncleanness must cleave to the teeth from eating. Therefore, she says, rinse your teeth. Why? That you
may be a man, and not a wild beast, or a swine. It
was impossible but that, from perspiration and the
pressure of the clothes, something dirty and necessary to be cleaned should remain upon the body.
For this there is water, oil, hands, towels, brushes,
soap, and other necessary apparatus for its purification. But no; a smith indeed will get the rust off his
iron, and have proper instruments for that purpose;
and you yourself will have your plates washed before
you eat, unless you are quite dirty and slovenly; but
you will not wash nor purify your body. " Why should
I? " say you. I tell you again, in the first place, that
you may be like a man; and, in the next, that you
may not offend those with whom you converse. Do
you think it fitting to smell offensively? Be it so.
But is it fitting as regards those who sit near you;
who are placed at the table with you; who salute
you?  Either go into a desert, as you deserve, or
live solitary at home, and be the only sufferer. But
to what sort of character does it belong to live in a
city, and behave so carelessly and inconsiderately?
If Nature had trusted even a horse to your care,
<pb id="p.2202"/>
would you have overlooked and neglected him? Yet
now, without being sensible of it, you do something
like this. Consider your body as committed to you,
instead of a horse. Wash it, rub it, take care that it
may not be any one's aversion, nor disgust any one.
Who is not more disgusted at a foul, unwholesome-looking sloven, than at a person who has been accidentally rolled in filth?  The stench of the one is
adventitious, from without; but that which arises
from want of care is a kind of inward putrefaction.
" But <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> bathed but seldom." Yet his person
looked clean, and was so agreeable and pleasing, that
the most beautiful and noble youths were fond of him,
and desired rather to sit by him than by those who
had the finest persons. He might have omitted both
bathing and washing, if he had pleased; and yet his
amount of bathing had its effect. Cold water may
supply the place of the warm bath. " But Aristophanes calls him one of the pallid, barefooted philosophers."<note anchored="yes">Clouds 103. --H.</note> Why, so he says, too, that he walked in the
air, and stole clothes from the Palaestra. Besides, all
who have written of Socrates affirm quite the contrary; that he was not only agreeable in his conversation, but in his person too. And, again, they write
the same of Diogenes. For we ought not to frighten
the world from philosophy by the appearance of our
persons; but to show our serenity of mind, as in all
other ways, so in the care of our persons. "See, all
<pb id="p.2203"/>
of you, that I have nothing; that I want nothing.
Without house, without city, and an exile (if that
happens to be the case), and without a home, I live
more easily and prosperously than the noble and
rich. Look upon my person, too, that it is not injured by coarse fare."  But if any one should tell
me this, bearing the habit and the visage of a condemned criminal, what god should persuade me to
come near philosophy, while it renders men such
figures? Heaven forbid! I would not do it, even
if I was sure to become a wise man for my pains.
I declare, for my own part, I would rather that a
young man, on his first inclination to philosophy,
should come to me finically dressed, than with his
hair spoiled and dirty. For there appears in him
some idea of beauty and desire of decency; and
where he imagines it to be, there he applies his endeavors. One has nothing more to do but to point
it out to him, and say, " You seek beauty, young man,
and you do well. Be assured, then, that it springs
from the rational part of you. Seek it there, where
the pursuits and avoidances, the desires and aversions, are concerned. Herein consists your excellence; but the paltry body is by nature clay. Why
do you trouble yourself, to no purpose, about it?
You will be convinced by time, if not otherwise, that
it is nothing." But if he should come to me soiled
and dirty, with mustaches drooping to his knees,
what can I say to him; by what similitude allure
<pb id="p.2204"/>
him?  For what has he studied which has any resemblance to beauty, that I may transfer his attention, and say that beauty is not there, but here?
Would you have me tell him that beauty consists
not in filth, but in reason? For has he any desire
of beauty?  Has he any appearance of it?  Go, and
argue with a hog not to roll in the mire.</p>
<p>It was in the quality of a young man who loved
beauty, that Polemo was touched by the discourses
of Xenocrates. For he entered with some incentives to the study of beauty, though he sought in the
wrong place. And, indeed, Nature has not made
the very brutes dirty which live with man. Does a
horse wallow in the mire; or a good dog? But
swine, and dirty geese, and worms, and spiders,
which are banished to the greatest distance from
human society. Will you, then, who are a man,
choose not to be even one of the animals that are
conversant with man; but rather a worm or a spider?
Will you not bathe sometimes, be it in whatever
manner you please? Will you never use water to
wash yourself?  Will you not come clean, that they
who converse with you may have some pleasure in
you? But will you accompany us, in your uncleanness, even to the temples, where all unclean ways are
forbidden?</p>
<p>What, then; would anybody have you adorn yourself to the utmost? By no means, except in those
things where our nature requires it, - in reason, prin-
<pb id="p.2205"/>
ciples, actions; but in our persons only so far as
neatness requires; so far as not to give offence. But
if you hear that it is not right to wear purple, you
must go, I suppose, and roll your cloak in the mud,
or tear it. "But how can I have a fine cloak?"
You have water, man; wash it.  What an amiable
youth is here! How worthy this old man to love
and be loved! A fit person to be trusted with the
instruction of our sons and daughters, and attended
by young people as occasion may require, - to read
them lectures from a dunghill! Every deterioration
takes its origin from something human; but this
almost dehumanizes a man.</p></div2>

<head>Of taking pains.</head>
<p>When you cease to take pains for a little while,
do not fancy that you may recommence
whenever you please; but remember this, that by
means of the fault of to-day, your affairs must necessarily be in a worse condition for the future. The
first and worst evil is that there arises a habit of
neglect; and then a habit of postponing effort, and
constantly procrastinating as to one's successes and
good behavior and orderly thought and action. Now,
if procrastination as to anything is advantageous, it
<pb id="p.2206"/>
must be still more advantageous to omit it altogether; but if it be not advantageous, why do you
not take pains all the time? " I would play to-day."
What then? Ought you not to take proper pains
about it? " I would sing." But why not take proper
pains about it?  For there is no part of life exempted,
about which pains are not needed. For will you do
anything the worse by taking pains, and the better
by neglect? What else in life is best performed by
heedless people?  Does a smith forge the better
by heedlessness? Does a pilot steer more safely by
heedlessness? Or is any other, even of the minutest
operations, best performed heedlessly? Do you not
perceive that, when you have let your mind loose,
it is no longer in your power to call it back, either to
propriety, or modesty, or moderation? But you do
everything at haphazard; you merely follow your
inclinations.</p>
<p>"To what, then, am I to direct my pains? "</p>
<p>Why, in the first place, to those universal maxims
which you must always have at hand; and not sleep,
or arise, or drink, or eat, or converse without them :
that no one is the master of another's will; and
that it is in the will alone that good and evil lie.
No one, therefore, is my master, either to procure me
any good, or to involve me in any evil; but 1 alone
have the disposal of myself with regard to these
things. Since these, then, are secured to me, what
need have I to be troubled about externals? What
<pb id="p.2207"/>
tyrant is formidable? What disease? What poverty?  What offence?  "I have not pleased such a
one." Is he my concern then? Is he my conscience? "No." Why, then, do I trouble myself
any further about him?  "But he is thought to be
of some consequence." Let him look to that; and
they who think him so. But I have One whom I
must please, to whom I must submit, whom I must
obey, - God, and those who surround him. He has
intrusted me with myself, and made my will subject
to myself alone, having given me rules for the right
use of it. If I follow the proper rules in syllogisms,
in convertible propositions, I do not heed or regard
any one who says anything contrary to them. Why,
then, am I vexed at being censured in matters of
greater consequence? What is the reason of this
perturbation?  Nothing else, but that in this instance
I want practice. For every science despises ignorance and the ignorant; and not only the sciences,
but even the arts. Take any shoemaker, take any
smith you will, and he may laugh at the rest of the
world, so far as his own business is concerned.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, these are the maxims we
must have ready, and do nothing without them, but
direct the soul to this mark; to pursue nothing external, nothing that belongs to others, but as he who
has the power has appointed. Things controllable by
will are to be pursued always; and the rest as may
be permitted. Besides this, we must remember who
<pb id="p.2208"/>
we are, and what name we bear, endeavoring to use
all the circumstances of life in their proper relations:
what is the proper time for singing, what for play,
and in what company; what will be the consequence
of our performance; whether our companions will
despise us, or we ourselves; when to employ raillery,
and whom to ridicule; upon what occasions to comply, and with whom; and then, in complying, how to
preserve our own character.</p>
<p>Wherever you deviate from any of these rules, the
damage is immediate; not from  anything external,
but from the very action itself. "What, then; is it
possible by these means to be faultless? " Impracticable; but this is possible, to use a constant endeavor
to be faultless. For we shall have cause to be satisfied, if, by never remitting our pains, we shall be
exempt at least from a few faults. But now, when
you say you will begin to take pains to-morrow, be
assured that it is the same thing as if you said, "Today I will be shameless, impertinent, base, it shall
be in the power of others to grieve me; I will be passionate, I will be envious to-day."  See to how many
evils you give yourself up. "But all will be well tomorrow." How much better to-day? If it be for
your interest to-morrow, how much more to-day, that
it may be in your power to-morrow too, and that you
may not again deter it until the third day.
<pb id="p.2209"/></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Concerning such as are too communicative</head>
<p>When any one appears to us to discourse frankly
of his own affairs, we too are somehow
tempted to disclose our secrets to him; and we consider this to be acting with frankness, - first, because
it seems unfair that when we have heard the affairs of
our neighbor, we should not in return communicate
ours to him; and besides, we think that we shall not
appear of a frank character, in concealing what belongs to ourselves. Indeed it is often said, " I have
told you all my affairs; and will you tell me none of
yours?  How happens this? "  Lastly, it is supposed
that we may safely trust him who has already trusted
us; for we imagine that he will never discover our
affairs, for fear we should in turn discover his. It is
thus that the inconsiderate are caught by the soldiers
at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. A soldier sits by you in a civilian's dress,
and begins to speak ill of Caesar. Then you, as if
you had received a pledge of his fidelity, by his first
beginning the abuse, say likewise what you think; and
so you are led away in chains to execution.</p>
<p>Something like this is the case with us in general.
But when one has safely intrusted his secrets to me,
shall I, in imitation of him, trust mine to any one who
<pb id="p.2210"/>
comes in my way?  The case is different. I indeed
hold my tongue (supposing me to be of such a disposition); but he goes and discovers them to everybody; and then, when I come to find it out, if I happen
to be like him, from a desire of revenge, I discover
his, and asperse and am aspersed. But if I remember that one man does not hurt another, but that every
one is hurt or profited by his own actions, I may
indeed keep to this, not to do anything like him;
yet, by my own talkative folly, I suffer what I do
suffer.</p>
<p>"Ay; but it is unfair, when you have heard the
secrets of your neighbor, not to communicate anything to him in return."  Why, did I ask you to do
it, sir? Did you tell me your affairs upon condition
that I should tell you mine in return? If you are a
gossip, and take all you meet for friends, would you
have me too become like you? But what if the case
be this; that you did right in trusting your affairs to
me, but it is not right that I should trust you?  Would
you have me run headlong, and fall? This is just as
if I had a sound barrel, and you a leaky one; and
you should come and deposit your wine with me, to
be put into my barrel; and then should take it ill
that, in my turn, I did not trust you with my wine.
No. You have a leaky barrel. How, then, are we
any longer upon equal terms? You have intrusted
your affairs to an honest man, and a man of honor;
one who finds his help or harm in his own actions
<pb id="p.2211"/>
alone, and in nothing external. Would you have me
intrust mine to you, who have dishonored your own
will, and who would get a paltry sum, or a post of
power or preferment at court, even if it required you
to kill your own children, like Medea? Where is the
fairness in this? But show me that you are faithful,
honorable, steady; show me that you have principles
conducive to friendship; show me that your vessel is
not leaky, and you shall see that I will not wait for
you to intrust your affairs to me, but I will come and
entreat you to hear mine. For who would not make
use of a good vessel? Who despises a benevolent
and friendly adviser? Who will not gladly receive
one to share the burden, as it were, of his difficulties;
and by sharing, to make it lighter? "Well, but I
trust you, and you do not trust me."  In the first
place, you do not really trust me; but you are a
gossip, and therefore can keep nothing in. For if the
former be the case, trust only me. But now, whenever you see a man at leisure, you sit down by him
and say: " My dear friend, there is not a man in th(
world who wishes me better, or has more kindness for
me, than you; I entreat you to hear my affairs." And
this you do to those with whom you have not the
least acquaintance.  But if you do trust me, it is
plainly as a man of fidelity and honor, and not because I have told you my affairs. Let me alone, then,
till I reciprocate this opinion. Convince me that if a
person has told his affairs to any one, it is a proof of
<pb id="p.2212"/>
his being a man of fidelity and honor. For if this
were the case, I would go about and tell my affairs to
the whole world, if I could thus become a man of
fidelity and honor. But that is no such matter; for
it demands of a man to have no ordinary principles.</p>
<p>If, then, you see any one taking pains for things
that belong to others, and subjecting his will to them,
be assured that this man has a thousand things to
compel and restrain him. He has no need of burning pitch, or the torturing wheel, to make him tell
what he knows; but the nod of a girl, for instance,
will shake his purpose; the good-will of a courtier;
the desire of an office, of an inheritance; ten thousand other things of that sort. It must therefore be
remembered, in general, that confidential discourses
require fidelity and a certain sort of principles. And
where, at this time, are these easily to be found?
Pray let any one show me a person of such a disposition as to say, I concern myself only for those things
which are my own, incapable of restraint, and by
nature free. This I esteem the essence of good. Let
the rest be as it may happen; it makes no difference
to me.

<body>
<head>The Enchiridion</head>
<div1 type="chapter" n="1">
<p>There are things which are within our power,
and there are things which are beyond our
power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire,
aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our
own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.</p>
<p>Now, the things within our power are by nature free,
unrestricted, unhindered; but those beyond our power
are weak, dependent, restricted, alien. Remember,
then, that if you attribute freedom to things by nature
dependent, and take what belongs to others for your
own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will
be disturbed, you will find fault both with gods and
men. But if you take for your own only that which
is your own, and view what belongs to others just as
it really is, then no one will ever compel you, no one
will restrict you, you will find fault with no one,
you will accuse no one, you will do nothing against
your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have
an enemy, nor will you suffer any harm.
<pb id="p.2216"/></p>
<p>Aiming therefore at such great things, remember
that you must not allow yourself any inclination, however slight, towards the attainment of the others; but
that you must entirely quit some of them, and for the
present postpone the rest. But if you would have
these, and possess power and wealth likewise, you
may miss the latter in seeking the former; and you
will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness
and freedom are procured.</p>
<p>Seek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every
unpleasing semblance, " You are but a semblance and
by no means the real thing." And then examine it by
those rules which you have; and first and chiefly, by
this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power, or those which are not; and if
it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared
to say that it is nothing to you.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="2">
<p>Remember that desire demands the attainment of
that of which you are desirous; and aversion demands
the avoidance of that to which you are averse; that
he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed; and he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched.  If, then, you shun only those
undesirable things which you can control, you will
never incur anything which you shun; but if you
shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the
risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aver-
<pb id="p.2217"/>
sion, then, from all things that are not within our
power, and apply it to things undesirable, which are
within our power.  But for the present altogether
restrain desire; for if you desire any of the things
not within our own power, you must necessarily be
disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those
which are within our power, and so are legitimate
objects of desire. Where it is practically necessary
for you to pursue or avoid anything, do even this with
discretion, and gentleness, and moderation.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="3">
<p>With regard to whatever objects either delight the
mind, or contribute to use, or are tenderly beloved,
remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning
with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup,
that it is but a cup of which you are fond, - for thus,
if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your
child, or your wife, that you embrace a mortal, - and
thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="4">
<p>When you set about any action, remind yourself
of what nature the action is. If you are going to
bathe, represent to yourself the incidents usual in the
bath, - some persons pouring out, others pushing in,
others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will
more safely go about this action, if you say to yourself, " I will now go to bathe, and keep my own will
<pb id="p.2218"/>
in harmony with nature." And so with regard to
every other action. For thus, if any impediment
arises in bathing, you will be able to say, "It was not
only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my will in
harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus,
if I am out of humor at things that happen."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="5">
<p>Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views
which they take of things. Thus death is nothing
terrible, else it would have appeared so to <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>.
But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it
is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others,
but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the
action of an uninstructed person to reproach others
for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and of one perfectly
instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="6">
<p>Be not elated at any excellence not your own. If
a horse should be elated, and say, " I am handsome,"
it might be endurable. But when you are elated, and
say, " I have a handsome horse," know that you are
elated only on the merit of the horse. What then is
your own? The use of the phenomena of existence.
So that when you are in harmony with nature in this
<pb id="p.2219"/>
respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you
will be elated at some good of your own.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="7">
<p>As in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you
go on shore to get water, you may amuse yourself
with picking up a shell-fish or a truffle in your way,
but your thoughts ought to be bent towards the ship,
and perpetually attentive, lest the captain should call,
and then you must leave all these things, that you
may not have to be carried on board the vessel,
bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead
of a truffle or shell-fish, such a thing as a wife or a
child be granted you, there is no objection; but if
the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these
things, and never look behind. But if you are old,
never go far from the ship, lest you should be missing
when called for.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="8">
<p>Demand not that events should happen as you
wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen,
and you will go on well.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="9">
<p>Sickness is an impediment to the body, but not to
the will, unless itself pleases. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will; and say this to
yourself with regard to everything that happens. For
<pb id="p.2220"/>
you will find it to be an impediment to something
else, but not truly to yourself.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="10">
<p>Upon every accident, remember to turn towards
yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use.
If you encounter a handsome person, you will find
continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience. And when thus
habituated, the phenomena of existence will not overwhelm you.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="11">
<p>Never say of anything, "I have lost it;" but, " I
have restored it." Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has
your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. " But it was a bad man who took it."  What
is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it again? While he permits you to possess
it, hold it as something not your own; as do travellers
at an inn.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="12">
<p>If you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as
these: "If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a
maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will
be good for nothing." For it were better to die of
hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in
affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your
servant should be bad than you unhappy.
<pb id="p.2221"/></p>
<p>Begin therefore with little things. Is a little oil
spilt or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, "This
is the price paid for peace and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing." And when you call
your servant, consider that it is possible he may not
come at your call; or, if he does, that he may not do
what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him,
and very undesirable for you, that it should be in his
power to cause you any disturbance.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="13">
<p>If you would improve, be content to be thought
foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you
should appear to others to be somebody, distrust
yourself. For be assured, it is not easy at once to
keep your will in harmony with nature, and to secure
externals; but while you are absorbed in the one,
you must of necessity neglect the other.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="14">
<p>If you wish your children and your wife and your
friends to live forever, you are foolish; for you wish
things to be in your power which are not so; and
what belongs to others to be your own. So likewise,
if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are
foolish; for you wish vice not to be vice, but something else. But if you wish not to be disappointed
in your desires, that is in your own power. Exercise,
<pb id="p.2222"/>
therefore, what is in your power. A man's master is
he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man
seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him
wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends
on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="15">
<p>Remember that you must behave as at a banquet.
Is anything brought round to you? Put out your
hand, and take a moderate share. Does it pass by
you?  Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not
yearn in desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you.
So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and
you will some time or other be worthy to feast with
the gods.  And if you do not so much as take the
things which are set before you, but are able even to
forego them, then you will not only be worthy to
feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For,
by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others
like them, deservedly became divine, and were so
recognized.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="16">
<p>When you see any one weeping for grief, either
that his son has gone abroad, or that he has suffered
in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the
apparent evil; but discriminate, and be ready to say,
"What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself,-
for another man might not be hurt by it, - but the
view he chooses to take of it."  As far as conversation
<pb id="p.2223"/>
goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him, and if need be, to groan with him. Take
heed, however, not to groan inwardly too.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="17">
<p>Remember that you are an actor in a drama of
such sort as the author chooses, - if short, then in a
short one; if long, then in a long one. If it be his
pleasure that you should enact a poor man, see that
you act it well; or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private
citizen. For this is your business, to act well the
given part; but to choose it, belongs to another.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="18">
<p>When a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not
overcome by appearances, but discriminate, and say,
" Nothing is portended to <emph>me</emph>; but either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or
wife. But to <emph>me</emph> all portents are lucky, if I will.
For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to derive
advantage therefrom."</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="19">
<p>You can be unconquerable, if you enter into no
combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see any one eminent in
honors or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be bewildered by appearances
and to pronounce him happy; for if the essence of
<pb id="p.2224"/>
good consists in things within our own power, there
will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your
part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a
consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is
a disregard of things which lie not within our own
power.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="20">
<p>Remember that it is not he who gives abuse or
blows who affronts; but the view we take of these
things as insulting. When, therefore, any one provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion
which provokes you.   Try, therefore, in the first
place, not to be bewildered by appearances. For if
you once gain time and respite, you will more easily
command yourself.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="21">
<p>Let death and exile, and all other things which
appear terrible, be daily before your eyes, but death
chiefly; and you will never entertain any abject
thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="22">
<p>If you have an earnest desire towards philosophy,
prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, "He is returned to
us a philosopher all at once;" and "Whence this
supercilious look? " Now, for your part, do not have
a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those
<pb id="p.2225"/>
things which appear best to you, as one appointed by
God to this particular station. For remember that,
if you are persistent, those very persons who at first
ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you
are conquered by them, you will incur a double
ridicule.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="23">
<p>If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of any one, be assured that you
have ruined your scheme of life. Be contented, then,
in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you
wish to seem so likewise to any one, appear so to
yourself, and it will suffice you.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="24">
<p>Let not such considerations as these distress you:
"I shall live in discredit, and be nobody anywhere."
For if discredit be an evil, you can no more be involved in evil through another, than in baseness. Is
it any business of yours, then, to get power, or to be
admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How
then, after all, is this discredit? And how is it true
that you will be .nobody anywhere; when you ought
to be somebody in those things only which are within
your own power, in which you may be of the greatest
consequence?  "But my friends will be unassisted."
What do you mean by unassisted? They will not
have money from you; nor will you make them
Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these are
<pb id="p.2226"/>
among the things within our own power, and not
rather the affairs of others? And who can give
to another the things which he himself has not?
" Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a
share." If I can get them with the preservation of
my own honor and fidelity and self-respect, show
me the way, and I will get them; but if you require
me to lose my own proper good, that you may gain
what is no good, consider how unreasonable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have,
a sum of money, or a faithful and honorable friend?
Rather assist me, then, to gain this character, than
require me to do those things by which I may lose
it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends
upon me, will be unassisted. Here, again, what assistance is this you mean? It will not have porticos
nor baths of your providing? And what signifies
that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with
shoes, nor a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if
every one fully performs his own proper business.
And were you to supply it with another faithful and
honorable citizen, would not he be of use to it?
Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to
it. "What place, then," say you, " shall I hold in
the state?" Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that, you lose these, how can
you serve your country, when you have become faithless and shameless?
<pb id="p.2227"/></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="25">
<p>Is any one preferred before you at an entertainment, or in courtesies, or in confidential intercourse?
If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he.
has them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved
that you have them not. And remember that you
cannot be permitted to rival others in externals, without using the same means to obtain them. For how
can he who will not haunt the door of any man, will
not attend him, will not praise him, have an equal
share with him who does these things? You are
unjust, then, and unreasonable, if you are unwilling
to pay the price for which these things are sold, and
would have them for nothing. For how much are
lettuces sold?  An obolus, for instance. If another,
then, paying an obolus, takes the lettuces, and you,
not paying it, go without them, do not imagine that
he has gained any advantage over you. For as he
has the lettuces, so you have the obolus which you
did not give. So, in the present case, you have not
been invited to such a person's entertainment, because you have not paid him the price for which a
supper is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold for
attendance. Give him, then, the value, if it be for
your advantage. But if you would at the same time
not pay the one, and yet receive the other, you are
unreasonable and foolish. Have you nothing, then,
in place of the supper? Yes, indeed you have: not
<pb id="p.2228"/>
to praise him whom you do not like to praise; not
to bear the insolence of his lackeys.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="26">
<p>The will of Nature may be learned from things
upon which we are all agreed. As, when our neighbor's boy has broken a cup, or the like, we are ready
at once to say, " These are casualties that will happen;" be assured, then, that when your own cup
is likewise broken, you ought to be affected just as
when another's cup was broken.   Now   apply this
to greater things.  Is the child or wife of another
dead? There is no one who would not say, " This
is an accident of mortality." But if any one's own
child happens to die, it is immediately, "Alas ! how
wretched am I! " It should be always remembered
how we are affected on hearing the same thing concerning others.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="27">
<p>As a mark 1 is not set up for the sake of missing
the aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in
the world.</p></div1>

<p>Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a
certain man your father? In this are implied, taking
care of him; submitting to him in all things; patiently receiving his reproaches, his- correction. But
he is a bad father. Is your natural tie, then, to a
<emph>good</emph> father? No, but to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation towards
him. Consider not what <emph>he</emph> does, but what <emph>you</emph> are
to do, to keep your own will in a state conformable
to nature. For another cannot hurt you, unless you
please. You will then be hurt when you consent to
be hurt. In this manner, therefore, if you accustom
yourself to contemplate the relations of neighbor,
citizen, commander, you can deduce from each the
corresponding duties.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="31">
<p>Be assured that the essence of piety towards the
gods lies in this, to form right opinions concerning
them, as existing, and as governing the universe
justly and well. And fix yourself in this resolution, to
obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow
<pb id="p.2230"/>
them amidst all events, as being ruled by the most
perfect wisdom. For thus you will never find fault
with the gods, nor accuse them of neglecting you.
And it is not possible for this to be effected in any
other way than by withdrawing yourself from things
which are not within our own power, and by making
good or evil to consist only in those which are. For
if you suppose any other things to be either good or
evil, it is inevitable that, when you are disappointed
of what you wish, or incur what you would avoid, you
should reproach and blame their authors. For ever}
creature is naturally formed to flee and abhor things
that appear hurtful, and that which causes them; and
to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial,
and that which causes them. It is impracticable,
then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt
should rejoice in the person who, as he thinks, hurts
him; just as it is impossible to rejoice in the hurt
itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by his son,
when he does not impart the things which seem to
be good; and this made Polynices and Eteocles mutually enemies, that empire seemed good to both. On
this account the husbandman reviles the gods; the
sailor, the merchant, or those who have lost wife or
child. For where our interest is, there too is piety
directed. So that whoever is careful to regulate his
desires and aversions as he ought is thus made careful of piety likewise. But it also becomes incumbent
on every one to offer libations and sacrifices and
<pb id="p.2231"/>
first-fruits, according to the customs of his country,
purely, and not heedlessly nor negligently; not
avariciously, nor yet extravagantly.</p></div1>

<p>When you have recourse to divination, remember
that you know not what the event will be, and you
come to learn it of the diviner; but of what nature it
is you knew before coming; at least, if you are of
philosophic mind. For if it is among the things not
within our own power, it can by no means be either
good or evil. Do not, therefore, bring with you to
the diviner either desire or aversion, - else you will
approach him trembling, -but first clearly understand that every event is indifferent, and nothing to
<emph>you</emph>, of whatever sort it may be; for it will be in
your power to make a right use of it, and this no one
can hinder. Then come with confidence to the gods
as your counsellors; and afterwards, when any counsel is given you, remember what counsellors you have
assumed, and whose advice you will neglect, if you
disobey. Come to divination, as <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> prescribed,
in cases of which the whole consideration relates to
the event, and in which no opportunities are afforded
by reason, or any other art, to discover the matter in
view. When, therefore, it is our duty to share the
danger of a friend or of our country, we ought not to
consult the oracle as to whether we shall share it with
them or not. For though the diviner should forewarn
<pb id="p.2232"/>
you that the auspices are unfavorable, this means no
more than that either death or mutilation or exile is
portended. But we have reason within us; and it
directs us, even with these hazards, to stand by our
friend and our country. Attend, therefore, to the
greater diviner, the Pythian God, who once cast out
of the temple him who neglected to save his friend.<note anchored="yes">This refers to an anecdote given in full by Simplicius, in his commentary on this passage, of a man assaulted and killed, on his way to consult the oracle, while his companion, deserting him, took refuge in the temple, till cast out by the Deity.- H.</note></p></div1>

<p>Begin by prescribing to yourself some character and
demeanor, such as you may preserve both alone and
in company.</p>
<p>Be mostly silent; or speak merely what is needful,
and in few words. We may, however, enter sparingly
into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it;
but let it not run on any of the common subjects, as
gladiators, or horse-races, or athletic champions, or
food, or drink, -the vulgar topics of conversation;
and especially not on men, so as either to blame, or
praise, or make comparisons. If you are able, then,
by your own conversation, bring over that of your
company to proper subjects; but if you happen to
find yourself among strangers, be silent.</p>
<p>Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.
<pb id="p.2233"/></p>
<p>Avoid taking oaths, if possible, altogether; at any
rate, so far as you are able.</p>
<p>Avoid public and vulgar entertainments; but if ever
an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention
upon the stretch, that you may not imperceptibly
slide into vulgarity. For be assured that if a person
be ever so pure himself, yet, if his companion be corrupted, he who converses with him will be corrupted
likewise.</p>
<p>Provide things relating to the body no farther than
absolute need requires; as meat, drink, clothing,
house, retinue. But cut off everything that looks
towards show and luxury.</p>
<p>Before marriage, guard yourself with all your ability
from unlawful intercourse with women; yet be not
uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this,
nor frequently boast that you yourself do otherwise.</p>
<p>If any one tells you that such a person speaks ill of
you, do not make excuses about what is said of you,
but answer: "He was ignorant of my other faults,
else he would not have mentioned these alone."</p>
<p>It is not necessary for you to appear often at public
spectacles; but if ever there is a proper occasion for
you to be there, do not appear more solicitous for any
other than for yourself; that is, wish things to be only
just as they are, and only the best man to win; for
thus nothing will go against you. But abstain entirely
from acclamations and derision and violent emotions.
And when you come away, do not discourse a great
<pb id="p.2234"/>
deal on what has passed, and what contributes nothing to your own amendment. For it would appear
by such discourse that you were dazzled by the
show.</p>
<p>Be not prompt or ready to attend private recitations; but if you do attend, preserve your gravity
and dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable.</p>
<p>When you are going to confer with any one, and
especially with one who seems your superior, represent to yourself how <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,2786859">Zeno</placeName> would behave
in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to meet
properly whatever may occur.</p>
<p>When you are going before any one in power,
fancy to yourself that you may not find him at
home, that you may be shut out, that the doors may
not be opened to you, that he may not notice you.
If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what
happens, and never say to yourself, "It was not
worth so much." For this is vulgar, and like a man
bewildered by externals.</p>
<p>In society, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers.  For however
agreeable it may be to yourself to allude to the risks
you have run, it is not equally agreeable to others to
hear your adventures.  Avoid likewise an endeavor
to excite laughter. For this may readily slide you
into vulgarity, and, besides, may be apt to lower you
in the esteem of your acquaintance. Approaches to
<pb id="p.2235"/>
indecent discourse are likewise dangerous.  Therefore when anything of this sort happens, use the first
fit opportunity to rebuke him who makes advances
that way; or, at least, by silence and blushing and
a serious look, show yourself to be displeased by such
talk.</p></div1>

<p>If you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being bewildered
by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure
yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both
points of time, -that in which you shall enjoy the
pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed it, - and
set before you, in opposition to these, how you will
rejoice and applaud yourself, if you abstain. And
even though it should appear to you a seasonable
gratification, take heed that its enticements and allurements and seductions may not subdue you; but
set in opposition to this, how much better it is to be
conscious of having gained so great a victory.</p></div1>

<p>When you do anything from a clear judgment that

person hurt; since he too is the person deceived.
For if any one takes a true proposition to be false,
the proposition is not hurt, but only the man is
deceived. Setting out, then, from these principles,
you will meekly bear with a person who reviles you;

<p>Never proclaim yourself a philosopher; nor make
much talk among the ignorant about your principles,
but show them by actions. Thus, at an entertainment, do not discourse how people ought to eat; but
eat as you ought. For remember that thus <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>
also universally avoided all ostentation. And when
persons came to him, and desired to be introduced
by him to philosophers, he took them and introduced
them; so well did he bear being overlooked. So if
ever there should be among the ignorant any discussion of principles, be for the most part silent. For
there is great danger in hastily throwing out what is
undigested. And if any one tells you that you know
nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may
be sure that you have really entered on your work.
For sheep do not hastily throw up the grass, to show
the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly
in wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you not make
an exhibition before the ignorant of your principles;
but of the actions to which their digestion gives
rise.

If at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to

<p>The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person
is that he never looks for either help or harm from
himself, but only from externals. The condition and
characteristic of a philosopher is that he looks to
himself for all help or harm. The marks of a proficient are that he censures no one, praises no one,
blames no one, accuses no one; says nothing concerning himself as being anybody, or knowing anything. When he is in any instance hindered or
restrained, he accuses himself; and if he is praised,
he smiles to himself at the person who praises him;
and if he is censured, he makes no defence. But he
goes about with the caution of a convalescent, careful
of interference with anything that is doing well, but
not yet quite secure. He restrains desire; he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the
<pb id="p.2241"/>

moderately in all directions; if he appears stupid or

Nature, and follow her. I ask, then, who interprets

seek, therefore, one to interpret <emph>them</emph>." So far there
is nothing to value myself upon. And when I find an
interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But if
I admire merely the interpretation, what do I become
more than a grammarian, instead of a philosopher,
except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret
Chrysippus? When any one, therefore, desires me to
read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush, when I cannot exhibit actions that are harmonious and consonant

<p>He is a man of sense who does not grieve for what
he has not, but rejoices in what he has.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="125">
<p>Epictetus being asked how a person might grieve
his enemy, answered, "By doing as well as possible
himself."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="126">
<p>Let no wise man estrange himself from the government of the state; for it is both wicked to withdraw
from being useful to the needy, and cowardly to give
way to the worthless. For it is foolish to choose
rather to be governed ill than to govern well.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="127">
<p>Nothing is more becoming a ruler than to despise
no one, nor be insolent, but to preside over all
impartially.
<pb id="p.2275"/></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="128">
<p>Any person may live happy in poverty, but few in
wealth and power. So great is the advantage of
poverty, that no wise man would exchange it for
disreputable wealth; unless indeed Themistocles, the
son of Neocles, the most wealthy of the Athenians,
but poor in virtue, was better than Aristides and
Socrates.  But both himself and his wealth are
perished, and without a name. For a bad man loses
all in death; but virtue is eternal.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="129">
<p>[Remember] that such is and was and will be
the nature of the world, nor is it possible that things
should be otherwise than they now are; and that not
only men and other creatures upon earth partake of
this change and transformation, but diviner things
also. For indeed even the four elements are transformed and metamorphosed; and earth becomes
water, and water air, and this again is transformed
into other things. And the same manner of transformation happens from things above to those below.
Whoever endeavors to turn his mind towards these
points, and persuade himself to receive with willingness what cannot be avoided, will pass his life in
moderation and harmony.
<pb id="p.2276"/></p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="130">
<p>He who is discontented with things present and
allotted is unskilled in life. But he who bears them,
and the consequences arising from them, nobly and
rationally, is worthy to be esteemed a good man.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="131">
<p>All things serve and obey the [laws of the] universe: the earth, the sea, the sun, the stars, and the
plants and animals of the earth. Our body likewise
obeys the same, in being sick and well, young and
old, and passing through the other changes decreed.
It is therefore reasonable that what depends on ourselves, that is, our own understanding, should not be
the only rebel.  For the universe is powerful and
superior, and consults the best for us by governing
us in conjunction with the whole.   And further,
opposition, besides that it is unreasonable, and produces nothing except a vain struggle, throws us into
pain and sorrows.

<p>What does it signify to me, said he, whether
the universe is composed of atoms or uncompounded substances, or of fire and earth? Is
it not sufficient to know the essence of good and
evil, and the proper bounds of the desires and aversions, and of the active powers; and by making use of
these as so many certain rules, to order the conduct
of life, and let go these things which are above us;
which, perhaps, are incomprehensible to human understanding, but if one should suppose them ever so
comprehensible, are still of doubtful benefit when comprehended. And must it not be said that he gives
himself trouble to no purpose who attributes these
things as essential to the character of a philosopher?
"What, then; is the Delphic admonition, <emph>Know thyself</emph>, superflous?"  "No, surely," said he. "What,
