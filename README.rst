The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) is a Python library offering natural language processing (NLP) for pre-modern languages.


Installation
============

For the CLTK's latest version:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install cltk

For more information, see `Installation docs <https://docs.cltk.org/en/latest/installation.html>`_ or, to install from source, `Development <https://docs.cltk.org/en/latest/development.html>`_.

Pre-1.0 software remains available on the `branch v0.1.x <https://github.com/cltk/cltk/tree/v0.1.x>`_ and docs at `<https://legacy.cltk.org>`_. Install it with ``pip install "cltk<1.0"``.

       abstract = "This paper announces version 1.0 of the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK), an NLP framework for pre-modern languages. The vast majority of NLP, its algorithms and software, is created with assumptions particular to living languages, thus neglecting certain important characteristics of largely non-spoken historical languages. Further, scholars of pre-modern languages often have different goals than those of living-language researchers. To fill this void, the CLTK adapts ideas from several leading NLP frameworks to create a novel software architecture that satisfies the unique needs of pre-modern languages and their researchers. Its centerpiece is a modular processing pipeline that balances the competing demands of algorithmic diversity with pre-configured defaults. The CLTK currently provides pipelines, including models, for almost 20 languages.",
